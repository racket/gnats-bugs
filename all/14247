The code below is a very minimized version of my list-moderation
script, which is how I saw this problem.  Running in in v5.3.6 vs a
newly built 6.0.0.1 has these times respectively:

  racket get-messages  0.28s user 0.06s system 78% cpu 0.441 total
  racket get-messages  0.36s user 0.07s system 7% cpu 5.514 total

The actual work is therefore taking more time with the new version,
and removing the `read-html-as-xml' shows it -- it's about twice
slower, possibly due to a slower startup.  But the bigger problem is
that it takes more time doing nothing when `read-html-as-xml' is
there.

I then replaced it with a `copy-port' to just dump the text, and
with the new version I see that after the dumping it just hangs
doing nothing for about 5 more seconds.

 Hi Eli,
 
 I can't recreate it here, but I have an idea. Can you try replace
 copy-bytes on line 140 on http-client.rkt with this:
 
 (define (copy-bytes in out count)
   (define buffer (make-bytes 1024))
   (let loop ([count count])
     (when (positive? count)
       (define r (read-bytes-avail! buffer in))
       (unless (eof-object? r)
         (write-bytes buffer out 0 r)
         (loop (- count r))))))
 
 I think maybe it's slow because it reads the bytes one at a time.
 
 Jay

 I've been investigating, and I currently think it has more to do with
 HTTP 1.1 and 1.0 on the server/network side, but I could be wrong.

 The difference appears to related to HTTP 1.0 vs 1.1.
 
 If you change the "1.0" embedded in the request below to "1.1", then
 there's a long pause after all the useful content is received, but
 before the 0-sized chunk that ends the chunked encoding of the content.
 (The content is not chunked in "1.0" mode.)
 
  #lang racket
  (require racket/port)
 
  (define-values (i o) (tcp-connect "lists.racket-lang.org" 80))
  (fprintf o
           (~a "POST /mailman/admindb/?details=all HTTP/1.0\r\n"
               "Host: lists.racket-lang.org:80\r\n"
               "User-Agent: Racket/6.0.0.1 (net/http-client)\r\n"
               "Content-Length: 13\r\n"
               "\r\n"
               "adminpw=bogus\r\n"))
  (flush-output o)
  (tcp-abandon-port o)
  (time (copy-port i (current-output-port)))
 
 Is there something about the above code that isn't the right way to do
 HTTP 1.1 (and that might similarly be wrong in `net/http-client`)?

 I doubt that, since when I dumped the port on stdout, the delay was
 all at the end...  (I can do that later if needed.)

 Ah, IIRC, I tried a few other sites and not all had the delay.  (Exam
 day, so I didn't have much time to look into things.)

 Are you saying that the problem is with the server?  Should I try it
 with things like curl, wget, or straight netcat?

 Actually, this was useful in that using HTTP/1.1 was showing some "0"
 output after the delay, which lead me to the keep-alive thing, and
 that looks like the source, and the ~5sec delay is apache timing out.
 For reference, Wikipedia says:
 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection#HTTP_1.1
   In HTTP 1.1, all connections are considered persistent unless
   declared otherwise
 
 and links to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.1 that which
 says the same.  I added a "Connection: close\r\n" to your code, and it
 went back to proper speed.
 
 So this header should be added (at least for the get-pure-port etc
 interface, I don't know if the new thing supports multiple requests).
 
 But in addition, it seems that the idea behind tcp-abandon port is no
 longer needed: replacing it with a `close-output-port' makes it go at
 normal speed too.  If I follow everything, then abandoning the port
 with a server assumption of keep-alive is exactly what leads to the
 delay.
 
 IMO, both things should be done.  So maybe extend the interface to
 have some `#:tcp-abandon?' keyword for using it in case some antique
 server needs it?
 
 (I think that the server that lead to the abandon thing was Yahoo,
 right?  If so, then that's probably no longer an issue.)

 Eli,
 
 Attach is a new net/http-client that should put in the close header.
 Can you check it on your use case?
 
 As far the abandon thing, I assumed that tcp-abandon-port did the same
 thing as close-output-port but "more". Right now the code never calls
 close, but it's pretty obvious where it would. Should I change it or
 is abandon-port at fault for not doing the close too?

 I would say that `tcp-abandon-port` is "less" than `close-output-port`
 in that it refrains from telling the other end of the TCP connection
 that the port has been closed.
 
 I don't remember why we had to use `tcp-abandon-port`, and it sounds
 plausible to me that we could change it, but I suggest trying that
 change after v6.0.
