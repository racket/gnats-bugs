>Description:
Http-client chokes on some chunked server responses with the error (for example):
 
http-conn-response/chunked: Could not parse "bb " as hexadecimal number

The issue seems to be the errant whitespace visible after bb in the above error. As far as I can tell, the space isn't in the rfc. However, browsers seem to correct for the issue, so it probably can be resolved unambiguously.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do a simple http-client query of any site that returns a chunk size with a trailing space. I can provide examples live on the internet.

 Can you provide one of those examples for testing?
