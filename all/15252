 This was fixed with this commit:
 
 https://github.com/racket/gui/commit/d88ba8d2cd7ee0346f04cc17f16c3a252d84e2a5
 
 You should be able to apply that diff to your installation and then,
 from the shell, run this command:
 
    raco setup
 
 (using an absolute path to the "bin" directory inside the place where
 you've installed DrRacket). When it completes, this should be fixed.
 
 Thanks for the report!

 Glad to hear it and the egg is all over my face, as I noticed this
 before the release but then forgot to get back to it. :(
