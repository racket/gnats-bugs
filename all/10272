>Description:
The program below seems like it should show highlighting in drscheme, but it does not. It seems like it shoudl because there is a three-stopsigns-icon that has a source location in the definitions window. 

This is running in module with errortrace turned on.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/load

(module server scheme
 (require scheme/contract)
 (provide/contract [f (-> (-> integer? integer?) procedure?)])
 (define (f x) x))

#|
  server                    client
         |--- integer? -->
         <--- integer? --|
         |-- procedure? ->
|#

(module client scheme
 (require 'server)
 ((f (lambda (x) x)) true))

(require 'client)
