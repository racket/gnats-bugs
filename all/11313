>Description:
I will show the problem using set-union as an example since it
is essentially the same for the other two cases.

When set-union is given 3 or more arguments the following code
is executed:

[(set . sets)
    (for ([s (in-list (cons set sets))]
          [i (in-naturals)])
      (unless (set? s) (apply raise-type-error 'set-union "set" i sets)))
    (for/fold ([set set]) ([set2 (in-list sets)])                 ^^^^
      (set-union set set2))]

However, the code should be:

[(set . sets)
    (for ([s (in-list (cons set sets))]
          [i (in-naturals)])
      (unless (set? s) (apply raise-type-error 'set-union "set" i (cons set sets))))
    (for/fold ([set set]) ([set2 (in-list sets)])                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      (set-union set set2))]
>How-To-Repeat:
(define A (set 1 2 3))
(define B (set 3 4 5))

;; current incorrect behaviour
(set-union A B 'not-a-set)
=> raise-type-error: position index is 2, but only 2 arguments provided

(set-union 'not-a-set A B)
=> set-union: expects type <set> as 1st argument, given: (set 1 2 3); other arguments were: (set 3 4 5)

;; correct behaviour
(set-union A B 'not-a-set)
=> set-union: expects type <set> as 3rd argument, given: 'not-a-set; other arguments were: (set 1 2 3) (set 3 4 5)

(set-union 'not-a-set A B)
=> set-union: expects type <set> as 1st argument, given: 'not-a-set; other arguments were: (set 1 2 3) (set 3 4 5)
