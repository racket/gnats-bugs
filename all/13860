 Thanks for the report! This appears to be a duplicate of PR 13856
   http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=13856
 
 I'm going to go ahead and close this, but if there's any additional
 information you can provide (e.g., any error message?) please do comment
 on the other PR.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
