>Description:
The following program works if the except-out line is removed. Other wise it gets the following error:
expand: unbound identifier in module in: foo
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module a typed/racket
  (define-struct: (V) foo ((v : V)))
  (provide
   (rename-out (make-foo foo))
   (except-out (struct-out foo) foo)
   )
  )

(module b racket
  (require 'a)
  (foo 3))

(require 'b)

 The bug is actually in the handling of rename-out. It looks like the external name which should be a symbol is treated like an identifier somewhere inside the TR processing of exports.
 
 Simpler program that exhibits the same behavior:
 
 #lang racket/load
 (module a typed/racket
   (define make-foo 3)
   (define-syntax foo (make-rename-transformer #'make-foo))
   (provide
    (rename-out (make-foo foo))
    make-foo
    )
   )
 
 (module b racket
   (require 'a)
   (foo 3))
 
 (require 'b)
