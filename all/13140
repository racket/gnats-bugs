>Description:
I just ran 'raco setup' twice in a row, and it started running all the .scrbl files over again the second time.  Presumably the first time should have done everything it needed to.  I have PLTCOMPILEDROOTS set; it is possible this is relevant.  Perhaps the "is this built already" check isn't looking in the right place.
