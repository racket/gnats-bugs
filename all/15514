 It sounds like you are running an interpreted version. How did you install? Could you run raco setup?

 Thank you for getting back to me. I hope I'm knowledgeable enough to answer
 your question properly. I just downloaded the most recent version for
 Windows x64 from https://download.racket-lang.org/ and ran the .exe.
 
 I ran raco setup after your email and it went through a bunch of "making"
 processes. Then when it went to ---creating launchers--- it ran into the
 same error repeatedly,  system error: Access is denied.; errid=5. I ran
 DrRacket again and I'm having the same issue.
