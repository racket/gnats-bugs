>Description:
Section 7.5

Spelling:

"betweeen"

[There's also an occurrence of "betweeen" in:
 src/plot/plplot/plot3d.c]

Section 7.6

Spelling:

"abstact"

Section 7.7 Additional Examples

There's a missing word here:

"...we use a mostly applicative, we retain..."

There should be a period after:

"Separate basic queries from derived queries"

Scheme should be Racket:

"Then in Scheme, ..."

Should be Mitchell and McKim for consistency:

"McKim and Mitchell's queue..."
