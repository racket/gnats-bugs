>Description:
On OSX, DrScheme has associations for both .ss and .scm, and files saved with those extensions open in DrScheme as they should. However, when saving a file, the default extension is .ss, and the save dialog box warns you if you try to save a file with .scm instead: "You have used the extension “.scm” at the end of the name. The standard extension is “.ss”."
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrScheme (default language: Module, #lang scheme)
2. Apple-s
3. Type "foo.scm" into the name field, click "Save"
