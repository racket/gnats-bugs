>Description:
check-metafunction currently generates args from the cases of the metafunction, but it doesn't check to make sure that these are actually accepted by the metafunction's contract. I think that it should do this as a filtering step by default after generating the args.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require redex/reduction-semantics)

(define-language TR
  (x y z ::= variable-not-otherwise-mentioned))

(define-metafunction TR
  test : (x y) -> (x ...)
  [(test (x ...)) (x ...)])

(check-metafunction test
     (lambda (args) (term (test ,@args))))
