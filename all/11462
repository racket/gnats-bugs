 You have to create the message with a bitmap label in the first place
 (but the error message is certainly broken).

 This program gives the same error.
 
 #lang racket/gui
 
 (send (new message%
            [parent (new frame% [label "the frame"])]
            [label (make-object bitmap% 1 1)])
       set-label
       (make-object bitmap% 1 1))
