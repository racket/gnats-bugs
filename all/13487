>Description:
sqlite3-connect with #:mode 'create does not report any error when given a path to an existing file.

Does that mean that the file is supposed to be overwritten or not?

Anyway, any action against the acquired connection gives an error message telling "multiple SQL statements given". In fact, there is only one SQL statement, and it is fine. The actual problem probably is that the connection is non-functional.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require db)

(define path "/tmp/mydb.db")

(with-output-to-file path
  (lambda () (printf "garbage\n"))
  #:exists 'replace)

(define conn (sqlite3-connect #:database path #:mode 'create))

(query-exec conn "create table A (n integer)")
