>Description:
assf is not defined in the HTDP student languages.  HTDP mentions assf in the table on p. 313 (along with map, foldr, etc.), so students might expect to use it, but assf isn't actually available.

It's kind of interesting which functions in the member/remove/assoc family are available:

member, memv, memq, memf
remove
assq
>How-To-Repeat:
Get an "Intermediate Student with lambda" REPL, and enter assf.
