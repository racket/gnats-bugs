Example:

$ racket
Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.1.
-> (module a racket (define x 3))
-> (module b racket (require rackunit) (require/expose 'a (x)))
-> (require 'b)
; standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found
;   for module path: a
;   collection: "a"
;   in collection directories:
;    /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/add-on/development/collects
;    /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/racket/collects
;    /home/asumu/code/raco-find-collection
;    /home/asumu/code/racket-benchmark
;    /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/racket/share/pkgs/ragg
; [,bt for context]

It seems to only work for modules installed in a collection, a package,
or in the current directory. If you provide a submodule argument, it will
raise a contract violation.

 Looks like the result of resolved-module-path-name is being treated as a 
 module-path. Which means that the code is broken for submodules too.
 
 Matthew: Is it okay if I change module->namespace to handle 
 module-path-indexes and resolved-module-paths in addition to module-paths?

 Yes, that sounds right.
