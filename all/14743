>Description:
I have a collection with `pre-install-collection' set to throw an
error when something's wrong, and it then proceeds to delete itself.
(It's the course thing, and it does the deletion to avoid leaving
unusable code behind.)

IIRC, this error used to work fine and abort the installation process
but now it continues the installation, resulting in another error when
it can't find the collection.

This is using an installation of a .plt file.
