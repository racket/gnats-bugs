On a fresh Racket install, the "Search in files..." feature's regexp filename filter only has "ss|scm"; should have "|rkt" as well.

Apparently you need to start with a fresh installation. I can't find where the default filter is stored in a preferences file or something (?), but I suppose if you delete that file, it should manifest itself.

 Thanks. I'll push a fix shortly. I've used a new key for the
 preference so that you'll see the new default in new versions (and if
 you use old versions, your preference will remain the same).

 FWIW, it was stored under the key
 drracket:multi-file-search:filter-string in the preferences file.
