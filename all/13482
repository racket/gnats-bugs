>Description:
There is an extra text line in the scheme_recur_equal_hash_key documentation: http://docs.racket-lang.org/inside/Miscellaneous_Utilities.html#%28cpp._scheme_recur_equal_hash_key%29

It says: "Returns the primary equal?-hash key for obj.}"
I think that the whole line should be removed. (Looks like a cut&paste error from the documentation about scheme_equal_hash_key.)
 
File: [plt] / collects / scribblings / inside / misc.scrbl
Line of 58:
- Returns the primary @racket[equal?]-hash key for @var{obj}.}
