On X, DrRacket correctly sets up its icon to be the Racket logo, but only after the main window comes up.  This means that while the splash screen is up, a generic icon is shown by the window manager.

I'm moving this to Matthew until the set-icon method works
on dialogs. If that's not a reasonable thing to ask for, I
can look into changing the splash screen to be a frame%
instead. (I can no longer recall why it is a dialog, sadly.)

 Attached is a patch that does the really simple thing -- it just moves
 the `set-icon' method to `basic-top-level-window%'.  With this (and
 the minor bug fix also in the patch) the splash screen has the right
 icon for me on Gtk.   Can someone test this/tell me if it's wrong for
 other platforms?

 It seems fine to me. I tried it under windows and nothing untoward
 seemed to happen.

 I will look into it more. I remember there being some issue about icons
 and dialogs --- maybe obsolete, now, but I haven't had a chance to page
 it back in.

 Ok --- it looks fine, and I'll push the change.
 
 Long ago, I think there was an issue with `set-icon' on dialogs for
 Windows. Maybe it was before `(bitwise-ior WS_CAPTION WS_SYSMENU)' was
 used for the dialog's style. Maybe it was before you could Google
 "WM_SETICON dialog" and immediately learn that those are the magic
 style flags to make icons work for dialogs. Maybe it was something
 else.
