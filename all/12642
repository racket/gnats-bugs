I did this and get the message "module: this function is not defined" in the interactions area. This is pretty frustratting to someone just trying
to get started with Racket.

 Right below that paragraph is the following discussion of setting up
 DrRacket to use the language declared in the source:
 
    If you’ve used DrRacket before, you might need to reset DrRacket
    to use the language declared in the source via the
    Language|Choose Language... menu item before clicking Run.
 
 If you follow those instructions, does the error go away?

 In the "Language" dialog, please choose the "Use the language declared
 in the source" option, which is at the top of the dialog box.  Then
 see if the program works.
