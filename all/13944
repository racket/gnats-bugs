>Description:
(exit:exit) → any
exit:exit performs four actions:
sets the result of the exit:exiting? function to #t.

invokes the exit-callbacks, with exit:can-exit? if none of the “can?” callbacks return #f,

invokes exit:on-exit and then

queues a callback that calls exit (a racket procedure) and (if exit returns) sets the result of exit:exiting? back to #t.

The second #t should be #f.
