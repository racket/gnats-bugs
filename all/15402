 I agree this is confusing and I'll think more about it, but "jump to
 definition" is using simple text-based search to find the definitions.
 
 I think you probably want to use "jump to binding occurrence".

 Hi Robby,
 
 I see. The issue is not just that other comments have some additional
 character in front of the expression while the multi-line comment doesn't,
 and this changes the find behavior. Based on the behavior of line and s-exp
 comments, then, I'd probably expect this to work but it doesn't:
 ********
 #|(define problem 'hi!)
 |#
 
 (define problem 5)
 
 problem
 ********
 I know it isn't a big deal but I find the difference in behavior surprising.

 Well, I welcome changes to the code if you can think of a better
 strategy! Let me know if you want help getting started.
