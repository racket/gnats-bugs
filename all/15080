>Description:
The text in the docs is:
Each flag string must be of the form "-x" or "+x" for some character x, or "â€“x" or "++x" for some sequence of characters x.

The dash in the second case is some long dash not two dashes. The code seems to be saying two dashes so something is either going wrong or the expectations of the docs are wrong. https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/pkgs/racket-doc/scribblings/reference/cmdline.scrbl#L107
