>Description:
While writing running small experiment using racket/place, racket produced the error:

current-directory: expects argument of type <complete path or string>; given: #<struct-type:gc-info>
  context...:
   #%utils: [running body]
   #%boot: [traversing imports]

at which point the process hung and would not respond to CTRL-\ or kill -9. The process eventually segfaulted.
>How-To-Repeat:
I Have been unable to reproduce the error, but I thought this should be logged anyways.
I will send along more information if I can reproduce.
