>Description:
I am trying to tell mzscheme to use "chrome" for displaying documentation, but it insists on using firefox.  This is on Ubuntu 10.04.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following shell script (warning: it deletes your preferences file), and observe the output; I expected to see "gnome-open" as the very last bit of output, but instead I see #f.

#!/bin/sh

rm -f $HOME/.plt-scheme/plt-prefs.ss

cat > try.ss<<EOF
#lang scheme
(require net/sendurl)
(external-browser)
EOF

mzscheme try.ss
# displays #f, as expected

cat > put-pref.ss<<EOF
#lang scheme
(put-preferences
 '(external-browser)
 '(gnome-open))

EOF

mzscheme put-pref.ss

# See? it's all nice and set
cat $HOME/.plt-scheme/plt-prefs.ss

mzscheme try.ss
# oddly, displays #f again; I was expecting 'gnome-open

 This is expected -- the docs are way out of line with how the
 `external-browser' parameter is used.  I'll fix it now.  The bottom
 line is that a #f value (which is the actual default value of the
 parameter) means that `send-url' will consult the preference.
 
 (Linux is responsible for making this such a mess...)
