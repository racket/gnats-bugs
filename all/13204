>Description:
Taking the contextual closure of a relation in redex seems
to ignore the domain of the given relation.

Below is a small program that shows the problem.

The s and r relations should be equivalent, but because
s is defined as the contextual closure of r, it does
not signal domain errors when applied to bad inputs.

The second test fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require redex/reduction-semantics)
(define-language L)

(define r
  (reduction-relation 
   L #:domain #f
   (--> #f #f)))

(define s ; ≡ r
  (context-closure r L hole))

(require rackunit)
(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (apply-reduction-relation r #t)))
(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (apply-reduction-relation s #t)))
