>Description:
I was experimenting with typed/racket, and I'd expect to get a Type Checker errors, but instead I got:

exception raised by error display handler: normalize-path: #<path:C:/var> (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist; original exception raised: Type Checker: Error in macro expansion -- insufficient type information to typecheck. please add more type annotations


Seems that Racket tries to read something from C:\var, which doesn't exist.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run some typed/racket code with type errors.
Example:

#lang typed/racket

(require racket/flonum)

(define N 3000000)
(define avector 
    (for/flvector #:length N ([i (in-range N)]) (random)))

(: sum-vec : Vector -> Float)
(define (sum-vec v)
  (for/fold ([i 0.0]) ([e (in-vector v)]) (+ e i)))

;(time (sum-vec avector))
(sum-vec avector)

 Might this be related to the bugs Eli just filed about '/var/' paths?

 Most likely.  The problem that Neil reported is:
 
 | exception raised by error display handler: normalize-path:
 | #<path:/var/tmp/racket> (within the input path) is not a directory or 
 | does not exist; original exception raised: reduction-relation:
 | before underscore must be either a non-terminal or a built-in
 | pattern, found 1 in b_1
 
 Since the .zo files in all installations are coming from the main
 build (a linux machine), then offending path gets translated as an
 absolute-but-not-complete path on windows that refers to C:\var when
 made complete.  Robby fixed some things in redex, but the above is
 from a different place, so it might still be there.  (So it would help
 if it's reproducible.)

 As far as I can tell, every occurrence of "/var/tmp/" in any of the
 "typed" collections in a recent nightly build are the path
 /var/tmp/racket/collects/racket/private/map.rkt, which is PR 12549.
 I'm going to close this as a duplicate of that bug.
