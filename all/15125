The error also shows up in the documentation of the *SL languages, e.g. here.

"true" and "false" are also not recognized as booleans when using "quote". For instance, '#true yields #true, but 'true yields the symbol 'true.

 Believe it or not this was intended. Matthias wrote a note to various
 mailing lists about the change if you want more information (let me know if
 you don't find it and I can forward it to you when I get to a real
 computer).
 
 There is a release in the works that will provide an option to go back to
 the old behavior but the new behavior is the default.
 
 Note that 'true being a symbol and not a Boolean is intact the main
 motivation for this change and racket has behaved that way for a long time.

 Hi Robby,
 
 thanks for the helpful answer.
 
 The change to #true and #false makes sense. I didn't realize that the
 grammar of *SL and HTDP/2e were also
 changed, such that it seems that the change was done consistently.
 
 I'll update my course notes to reflect the renaming.
 
 Klaus
