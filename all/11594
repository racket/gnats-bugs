 I just installed a fresh 5.0.2 fired it up, put "#lang slideshow" in
 the window, hit Run and it didn't produce any errors.
 
 Have you edited any files in the distribution, by chance? Is it
 possible that, after a file change, some dependent didn't get
 recompiled? You can test this theory by opening a command prompt,
 cd'ing to the directory where Racket is installed
 (C:\cygwin\usr\local\Racket is what it looks like it is on your
 machine, judging from the auto bug report info) and running the
 command "raco setup".
 
 It may take a while to finish....

 Hi Robby,
 
 I'm sorry for the bother. What happened was apparently an old install
 of PLT Scheme (version 4. something) was interfering. After I
 uninstalled that, DrRacket worked fine.
 
 I'm happy to see that Racket allows for true Scheme as a language, so
 now maybe my old type checker will be able to work again in the R5RS
 language (since it uses mutable cons cells).
 Anyway, I want to play with Redex...
