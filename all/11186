>Description:
If you choose Add teachpack from Language in #lang racket mode, 
you get this drop-down message: 

 "Teachpacks are only available in these languages: 
 "

This is the complete message. No languages are listed. 
I suggest the message "Teachpack selection isn't 
available in this language. Use require instead." 

I am open to other suggestions.

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "change-request" by matthias at Sat, 11 Sep 2010 10:38:17 -0400
Reason>>> This bug happened in a broken version of DrRacket. SORRY. 
I do think though that we may wish to change the message
anyway. Indeed, the add teachpack menu entry should just
disappear in these languages.

 Oh, sorry. I should have read ahead.
 
 The message was changed to be that more complex thing intentionally
 rather than the simpler to implement suggestions you make below. I
 can't recall who wanted it or why anymore, tho, sadly.
