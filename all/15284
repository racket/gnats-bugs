1) The Racket Reference, 1.1.10.5 Submodules
"...and thier implementations..." (spelling)

2) The Racket Reference, 1.1.10.2 The Separate Compilation Guarantee
Something seems to be wrong in this section.  After you copy/paste the
example set of modules to the Racket 6.4 REPL, "(require 'test)"
doesn't output 2 0 2 0 but 2 2 2 0.

3) Package Management in Racket, 2.2 Package Sources
"...either starts with starts with..." (unintended repetition?)

4) Package Management in Racket, 2.2 Package Sources
"...the same as if --–link or --–static-link is supplied..."
(3 dashes instead of 2)

 I fixed the typo-level mistakes. Thanks for the report!

 This one, though, I'm not sure what to do about.
 
 I can confirm the "2 2 2 0" output, both at the REPL and with the
 modules in separate files.
 
 This suggests that the implementation does not match the docs
 (anymore). If that means a change in the separate compilation
 guarantees, then maybe that section needs to be revised.
