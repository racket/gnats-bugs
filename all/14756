 Did you install the 32 bit version or 64 bit version of DrRacket? If
 the 32bit, you may find that the 64 bit version works. If the 64bit,
 then please let us know and we will have follow up questions!
 
 Thanks,

 I installed the 32 bit, I'll uninstall and try the 64 bit.

 Thanks. There is a known bug in the 32bit one (that we have only in
 the last few days come to an understanding of).

 My windows is 32 bit, so 64 bit is incompatible. Can I use the 32 bit version if I don't move the window, or is that not known yet?

 Unfortunately, the 32-bit version of v6.1 is likely to have trouble
 even if you don't move the window.
 
 Please try a snapshot of the current development version from one of
 the sites listed at
 
  http://pre.racket-lang.org/
 
 We believe that we've fixed the bug, so let us know if you still
 encounter trouble.

 I believe it will eventually crash.
 
 The best we can offer right now is to use a pre-release snapshot build. You
 can find those here:
 
 http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 Let us know if that works! And sorry about this.
