 Where exactly are you putting the cursor?  Is it before or after an
 "("?  If you can indicate exactly where your cursor is, and where the
 highlight is, that would be useful.

 There's a (very nice) picture of the issue at http://i.imgur.com/7FHgM.jpg now.
 
 However, I'm not able to reproduce this with DrRacket.  What version
 of DrRacket are you using?

 Hi Jingfeng,
 
 Can you provide some more information about what version of DrRacket
 you're using, so that we can try to track down this bug?
 
 Thanks,
 Sam
