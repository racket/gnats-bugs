>Description:
The program attached below demonstrates a possible laziness/performance bug
in stream-append. Like other stream functions, stream-append should create
the resulting stream lazily, but it seems to be forcing more than necessary.

The example below compares the same program (which computes some nonsense
data) using the SRFI-41 stream-append procedure and the racket/stream
stream-append procedure. The former is 30 times faster.

(sorry for the length of the example, it was extracted from a larger
 program and we couldn't figure out how to simplify it further while
 still showing the bug)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base

(require (prefix-in r: racket/stream)
         (prefix-in s: srfi/41))

;; nonsense computation that exercises streams
(define (run the-append n)
  (define (process-row qss-so-far r)
    (r:stream-fold
     (λ (acc qs)
       ;; should be lazy
       (the-append (r:stream-map (λ (c) qs) (s:stream-range 0 n))
                   acc))
     s:stream-null
     qss-so-far))
  (define all-possible-solns
    (r:stream-fold process-row (s:stream s:stream-null) (s:stream-range 0 n)))
  (r:stream-first all-possible-solns))

;; fast - SRFI-41
(define s1 (time (run s:stream-append 6)))

;; very slow - racket/stream
(define s2 (time (run r:stream-append 6)))

;; sanity check
(equal? (r:stream->list s1) (r:stream->list s2))
