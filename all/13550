Here is written:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/syntax-overview.html

Syntactically, the first expression in a function call could even be a number—but that leads to an error, since a number is not a function.

    > (1 2 3 4)

    application: not a procedure;

     expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments

      given: 1

      arguments...:

       2

       3

       4

When you accidentally omit a function name or when you use parentheses around an expression, you’ll most often get an “expected a procedure” error like this one.

I suggested that you should substitute "When you accidentally omit a function name or when you use parentheses around an 
                        expression, you’ll most often get an “expected a procedure” error like this one." with "When you accidentally omit a function name, you’ll most often get an “expected a procedure” error like this one.". But bremner and mithos28 said:

 I agree with mithos28 here: the word "extra" is what's intended here.
 What the prose is saying is trying to emphasize the difference between
 Racket and other languages that a professional programmer may know: in
 many other languages, extra parens do not change the meaning of a
 program.  In Racket, this is not the case, so the warning in the Guide
 should mention "extra".
 
 
 I'll add the word to the docs shortly.
