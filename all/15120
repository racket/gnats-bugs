>Description:
If one presses '.' or 'n' a single time (or an odd number of times less than that which would cause one to lose), one becomes out of step with the pumpkins indefinitely. So far as I can tell, it is then impossible to lose; that is, when one's player and the pumpkins are on adjacent squares, moving towards the pumpkins effectively swaps the player with the pumpkins. The pumpkins never reach the player unless 'n' or '.' is pressed again.

In order to solve this problem, either moving onto the pumpkins' square should be made illegal, or when the pumpkins are on the adjacent square, only one should jump towards the player's square (i.e. one pumpkin is left behind so that jumping onto the pumpkins' square results in a death of the player).

The pumpkins and the player will be out of step so that they swap when adjacent, allowing the player to easily finish the game.
