>Description:
OK, I can see redefining "star" to always produce a 5-pointed star built by connecting non-adjacent points with straight lines.
I can see some value in "star-polygon", defined in terms of how far to skip in drawing these straight lines.  But sometimes (e.g. when inscribing or circumscribing) it's more convenient to specify an external and internal radius instead, as in the old "star" function.  Is something like that still available?  Or do we have to do the trig ourselves?

 f you propose a good name I'll add it. (The name star-polygon is
 apparently a well established one. At least it is in wikipedia so it
 willbecome one if it isn't already.)

 After thinking about it a little, I think we need to include the word
 "star". What do you think about radial-star?

 Yes, that would be nice; I'm not sure it's an absolute necessity.

 If this conversation had never happened, I think I would have an easier time=
  guessing what an "indented-polygon" is than a "radial-star".  But I'm open t=
 o be convinced....

 I just want to keep the name "star" in there so people find it next to
 the other "star" functions more easily.

 I went ahead and pushed a change with the name radial-star. If a
 better suggestion comes along, I'll change it.

 The other one I was thinking of is star-by-radius, but that's getting  
 long and wordy.

 I've been toying with scribed-star or similar, trying to find a word
 like inscribed or circumscribed to fit with the star, but without much
 success.
