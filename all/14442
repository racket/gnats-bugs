(+ (values 1 0) (values 2 0))

In both guile and common lisp it can produce the result 3.
But racket reports an error:
=========
result arity mismatch;
 expected number of values not received
  expected: 1
  received: 2
  values...:
   1
   2
  context...:
   c:\Program Files (x86)\lisp\racket\collects\racket\private\misc.rkt:87:7

In my understanding, "values" can be treated as its first value until it was accessed by forms like "let-values", else I cannot see any difference between values and normal list.
