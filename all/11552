>Description:
When using Parcellite, a clipboard manager for GNOME, cutting text to the clipboard makes both Dr Racket and Parcellite unresponsive, as if they were trapped in a deadlock. Killing Parcellite afterwards does not resume Dr. Racket, but killing Dr. Racket does make Parcellite come back.

When the problem occurs, the following output can be seen in the console:

bytes-length: expects argument of type <byte string>; given #f

 === context ===
/usr/local/racket-5.0.99.4/collects/mred/private/wx/gtk/clipboard.rkt:180:2: provide-data method in clipboard-driver%
/usr/local/racket-5.0.99.4/collects/mred/private/wx/gtk/queue.rkt:184:31

/usr/local/racket-5.0.99.4/collects/mred/private/wx/common/queue.rkt:522:3

I don't know whether the bug resides in Dr. Racket or Parcellite or both, but since I have only seen Dr. Racket exhibit this behavior I decided report it here.

PS: Great job on the new UI! It looks gorgeous in GNOME.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Install and run parcellite.

2. Fire up  Dr. Racket.

3. Write some sexy sexps.

4. Cut them.

5. Reel in horror as you realize that your work lost is forever.

If Parcellite is killed prior to cutting up text, Dr. Racket responds as normal.

 Could you try a more recent version to check whether it's fixed? I
 revised the clipboard implementation on Monday.
 
 Thanks for the report!

 Hi.
 
 Yeah, I tested it on DrRacket 5.0.99.5--2010-12-17(d2fb0b8/a) and the
 problem persists.
