>Description:
DrRacket has a significant amount of lag on Ubuntu 16.04; typing, scrolling, selecting are all quite delayed. I have DrRacket installed on Windows on the same machine and it works fine, no lag whatsoever. Other text editors (Gedit) and IDEs (vscode) also work fine on Ubuntu.
>How-To-Repeat:
- Open a 150-line file
- Scroll to bottom
- Takes about five seconds to scroll all the way

- Type anything - noticeable delay between keystroke and screen update
>Fix:
