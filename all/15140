>Description:
DC-based picts that use `get-scale` and `set-scale` render incorrectly, since the `scale` pict combinator uses the dc `scale` method, which affects the dc's "initial matrix" but *not* its scale (as reported by `get-scale`).

So far I've found this to affect `shadow-frame` from unstable/gui/pict and `angel-wing` and `desktop-machine` from pict.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require pict)
(angel-wing 100 100 #t)
(scale (angel-wing 200 200 #t) 1/2)

One would expect the two picts to look the same. But the second one is just a fragment of a wing.

 FWIW, I filed an issue in the pict repo earlier about this.
