>Description:
I'm experiencing some strange interaction between Check Syntax and a split window in DrRacket that seems to hang it, or make it pretty much unresponsive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following program into DrRacket, inserting lots of blank lines before the last expression, so that scroll bars appear in the window.

#lang racket
(define a 1)
(define b 2)
; insert lots of new lines here
(+ a b)


(Alternately, open a largish file in DrRacket.)

Press "Check Syntax".
Split the window (C-x 2  or View->Split)
Scroll down
Attempt to move the mouse over the operands of + in the last expression
DrRacket becomes extremely sluggish and doesn't respond to anything.

-----

(Alternately, split the window first, scroll around a bit, then "Check Syntax", and then move mouse over any identifiers. DrRacket hangs.)

 Please update to the latest version. I believe this has been fixed.
