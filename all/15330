>Description:
It appears that there's a problem at the 
TR->contract boundary when multiple structures
have the same name. This bug was not present in
6.5, but is present in the 6.6 release candidate.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program:

#lang racket/base

(module base typed/racket/base
  
  (provide (struct-out Record))
  (struct Record ([id : Integer]) #:transparent))

(module yy typed/racket/base
  
  (require (prefix-in roles: (submod ".." base)))
  (provide (struct-out Record))
  (struct Record ([subrec : roles:Record]) #:transparent))

(require (prefix-in role: 'yy)
         (prefix-in roles: 'base))
         
(role:Record-subrec (role:Record (roles:Record 0)))

Running this produces the error message:

Record-subrec: contract violation
  expected: Record?
  given: (Record (Record 0))
  in: the 1st argument of
      (-> Record? any)
  contract from: 
      (/private/tmp/record-bug.rkt yy)
  blaming: /private/tmp/record-bug.rkt
   (assuming the contract is correct)
  at: /private/tmp/record-bug.rkt:12.10

The field access should succeed (and it does, in
6.5), because the given structure is in fact a 
role:Record. This problem goes away if the two
structures have different names, or if the
enclosing module is also written in TR.
