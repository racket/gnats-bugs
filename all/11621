>Description:
I've just started using DrRacket on OS X (10.5), and there's an odd bug that's rather frustrating.

http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/interactions-window.html says that in the interaction window "you can force DrRacket to evaluate the expression by typing Alt-Return or Command-Return (depending on your platform)."

The mac equivalent (option-enter) does indeed force evaluation, but it also inserts a newline into the expression (at the current location) before evaluation.  This is at best annoying and at worst breaks the expression by introducing whitespace in the middle of a word/token/etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
(Using DrRacket on OS X 10.5)

General steps:
1. Go to the interaction window, provide any input.  
2. Position the cursor in the middle of the input.
3. Press option-enter.

Observe that a newline is inserted at the position of the cursor, and only afterward is the expression evaluated.

Specific example:

1. In the interaction window, enter 
    (lambda (x) x)

2. Position the cursor between the 'm' and 'b' in 'lambda'

3. Press alt-enter. The result is an error, because 'lam' is not defined.
