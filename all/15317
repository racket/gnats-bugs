 Thank you for the report. I've pushed a change that might make this
 situation better.
 
 In general, there is a problem with the way the notifications are set
 up. In particular, the code doesn't explicitly track when that menu
 should change but instead uses a callback when the menu is opened to
 check. This callback has only a limited amount of time to do work and
 the work here might be too much in some cases. The change I've made
 should make this slightly better but if you see an empty menu, you
 might have to open the menu a second time to see its contents properly
 populated.
 
 Robby
