>Description:
Lists of images in the REPL in Dr. Racket don't seem to display repeated images. The length of such lists is correct though (doesn't seem to break anything, just confusing for students when they're using the REPL and the list isn't represented as expected).
>How-To-Repeat:
; note, this is just to make it easy to draw stuff
(require 2htdp/planetcute)
(define hearts (list heart heart))

; then in the repl, just type hearts, and the list will only
; show one heart, but its length will definitely be two
; note, you can also just try (list heart heart) in the REPL
