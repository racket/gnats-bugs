 I think that you can only call with-gl-context after the canvas has
 been shown and maybe even only in the context of the on-paint
 function.

 I had to reply a second time because the first reply didn't go to the bug
 tracker, because your bug tracker doesn't use Reply-To. 
 
 As I said in the original reply, you seem to be wrong about the problem
 being caused by using with-gl-context outside of an on-paint event. 
 
 Another way to reproduce the problem is to try to run the
 share/pkgs/sgl/examples/gears.rkt program. This program pops up a
 dialog box that reads "There was an error initializing OpenGL. Maybe
 OpenGL is not supported on the current platform."
 
 This message is probably popped up in response to a failure in using
 with-gl-context or get-gl-context.
