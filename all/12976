In DrRacket there should be some sort of combination of visual indicators to show the current line. Perhaps an arrow icon next to the line number. Perhaps highlighting the line with some background/foreground change.

Sometimes I lose the text insert cursor (see bug report [racket-bug] all/12975: Disppearing text-insert cursor) and it is impossible to see what is the current line until some edit is performed.

 Do you have line numbers turned on (View|Show Line Numbers)? If so,
 how about I make DrRacket draw the line numbers that include the
 selection differently somehow?

 Thanks. I'll play around with some things to see if I can find
 something that looks nice. I just wanted to be sure that, if I did put
 something there, it'd actually answer your request.

 I did something for this, but along the way I had two questions:
 
 1) is there a way to draw with a pen that matches the OS-level text
 selection color? (I thought that 'hilite brush style would do that, but it
 doesn't seem to now).
 
 1b) I ask this because it seems like the little green bubbles I'm currently
 drawing would be better in the text selection color. But maybe that'd be
 confusing, too. What do you think?
 
 2) It seems like I should be calling invalidate-bitmap-cache when the
 insertion point moves to invalidate the line number region on the line
 where it moves from and the line where it moves too. I'm not currently
 doing that because I don't see a callback function for "where it moves
 from" side. That is, I see an after-set-position method, but not an
 on-set-position method.
 
 For now, I'm actually always drawing on the line where the insertion point
 is/was, but when lines wrap it may make sense to also draw on those lines.
 (When I tried this, I see that I'd need the other callback). I think it is
 probably fine not to draw then, so this isn't really something I'd use for
 now. I'm mostly asking just to be sure I didn't miss something and maybe
 later I'd ask for actual code to be added. :)
 
 (okay that was kind of 3 questions)

 <br>
 Reported by Kieron Hardy for release: 5.3.0.16--2012-07-29(14f2541/a)<br>
 <br>
 *** Description:<br>
 In DrRacket there should be some sort of combination of visual indicators t=
 o show the current line. Perhaps an arrow icon next to the line number. Per=
 haps highlighting the line with some background/foreground change.<br>
 
 <br>
 Sometimes I lose the text insert cursor (see bug report [racket-bug] all/12=
 975: Disppearing text-insert cursor) and it is impossible to see what is th=
 e current line until some edit is performed. Highlighting the line would be=
  nice in any case, since it is sometimes difficult to detect in a large amo=
 unt of text).<br>

 It might be a good choice in the case that `(get-highlight-text-color);
 returns #f (which indicates Mac-style highlighting, as opposed to
 Windows-style). I haven't yet looked at the new green bubbles, though.

 I'm not sure I follow. I guess it doesn't work to track the old
 location yourself through a field that it updated in
 `after-set-position'?

 Sorry-- didn't push the change yet. I'll give that a try, tho. Thanks.

 Ah, that would work. Sorry.
