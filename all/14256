>Description:
The Windows installer should not write global registry keys if it's
not a published official version.  It currently does that with
6.0.0.1.

I just verified this sequence from scratch:

* Install 5.3.6; random x.rkt files open DrR 5.3.6
* Install 6.0.0.1; now x.rkt runs DrR 6.0.0.1
* Uninstall 6.0.0.1; and now x.rkt files have no association at all.
  -> but it does open the Windows dialog that asks you to choose an
     application, though DrR is not in it (possibly because 5.3.6
     didn't do something)

(Note that for Windows users, this is pretty bad, since the only way
to try out builds is to uninstall their stable version, install the
testing one, then uninstall it and re-install the original one.)

Looking at the code, it seems that the only use of `nsis-generate' is
always doing (get-extreg "bundle/racket"), and should probably leave
it null together with the other `get-*'s, or possibly add a keyword
that makes it ignore all of these global-only settings.

 Just to be clear, you're suggesting a change relative to the old
 nightly builds (such as 5.3.4.11, which also writes global registry
 keys), right?

 Yes.  It's not a big problem is prebuilt installers are not too
 common, but since they're going to be more popular, and specifically,
 if they're suggested to students, then this problem becomes more real.
 
 (It might not be a problem if things will settle on a similar pattern
 as they were, and in that case maybe it's enough to disable these keys
 only on current non-release builds.)
 
 BTW, looking at the code, I think that it's enough to define
 "SimpleInstaller" to get an installer that doesn't do any global work.
 It's probably much easier to do just this -- via the currently-unused
 `#:simple?' keyword.  IIRC, the result would be equivalent to just
 creating a directory without any registry changes.  (But those kind of
 installers were obviously not made for a while...)
