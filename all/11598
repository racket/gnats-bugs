>Description:
Some of the test cases for picturing-programs that worked a week ago no longer work: every time the tick handler of a "big-bang" animation is called, I get the above error message and the display doesn't change.  In particular, a "big-bang" animation whose tick handler is a bitmap-to-bitmap function (using map-image or build-image).  There's no problem if I do the exact same bitmap-to-bitmap operation from the REPL, or if I do a "big-bang" animation whose tick handler is a rotation or a scaling.
>How-To-Repeat:
See .../collects/picturing-programs/test/map-image-isl-tests.rkt

Using myflip, or myfuzz, or masked-fuzz, or white->trans, as the tick handler triggers the bug.
