 Maybe I'm confused (which is happens easily enough with the number
 syntax), but it looks to me like the printer isn't printing the number
 correctly. Shouldn't the result of
 
  (real->single-flonum 1.1e-20)
 
 print as
 
  1.1f-20
 
 ?
 
 It looks like `number->string' is always adding "f0" to the end of the
 number for single precision, but I think it should instead replace an
 "e" if there is one.

 Fixed. Thanks for the report!
 
 That was indeed a bug in the printer.
