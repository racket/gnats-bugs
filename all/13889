 DrRacket assumes that you choose a language that suits your needs. When the docs say 'Racket', they really mean you are using the Racket programming language. In DrRacket, you indicate the choice of language in two ways: 
 
 1. In normal mode, you just write 
  
  #lang racket 
 
 2. In 'other' modes, you choose a language from a menu. Whatever language you choose is not Racket but a language implemented via Racket. For example, you may use the teaching languages BSL through ASL. Or Algol60. But it really isn't Racket. 
 
 If you happen to know Eclipse, DrRacket is also a multi-lingual IDE. It's mostly for () languages but not necessarily. And just like in Eclipse you need to communicate which language you are using.

modes
