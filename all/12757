>Description:
I visited:

    http://racket-lang.org/community.html

and put my email address into the form field.  I pressed enter, and saw the following error message:


################################################################
Not Found
The requested URL /users/subscribe was not found on this server.
################################################################


The "action" portion of each form element should point to lists.racket-lang.org.
