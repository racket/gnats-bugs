 1. Switch to a teaching language (use Language | Choose or cmd-L). Beginning Student Language will do fine. 
 
 2. Enter the following into the definitions area: 
 
 (define (p x) (+ (* 2 (expt x 3)) (* 4 x x) (* -1 x) 12))
 
 (p 0)
 
 3. Click on Stepper icon. 
 
 4. Click on stepper's button to go back and forth in the evaluation of this polynomial.

 The info that was crucial is putting the function invocation(s) into the 
 definitions window. I've started working through
 the exercises in the book and was putting the function invocation on the 
 command line and then trying to use
 the stepper -- that doesn't work.
 
 Thanks,

 But this does raise again a years-old issue: how do you Step something in the interactions pane?  Ideally, I'd like the Stepper to be a mode switch: when it's on, anything you evaluate (whether in Definitions or Interactions) is single-stepped.

 Why don't you and John figure out how to get this going? I'd love to have it too -- Matthias

 Ok I'll look into it.
 
 Would it be satisfactory to have a stepper "go" form that can be
 dispatched from the command line? Something like (stepper-go <expr to
 step>)?

 This would be a perfectly good start.

 That's one piece of the puzzle.  The other piece is figuring out the right user interface.  I started drawing up some state diagrams for the user interface a few years ago, and there are a lot of weird special cases to consider; since nobody else seemed highly motivated to work on it, I dropped the issue.  Maybe I'll take another look in the next few weeks.
