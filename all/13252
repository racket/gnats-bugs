I sometimes accidentally select View | Split.  When I then select View | Collapse, it closes the "wrong" window, so that my screen's definition/interaction split is now greatly skewed (roughly, 50-50 becomes 75-25).  This is disruptive when it happens in a live class and I've set up various things carefully to avoid scrolling.

 It does for me, but probably my windows are not quite the same as
 yours. Screenshots, or a more careful description would be helpful.
 
 FWIW, I just tried this with a full-size window with the interactions
 shown and a roughly 50/50 split between the defs and ints. Split then
 gives me a 25/25/50 split and collapse goes back to 50/50 split.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
