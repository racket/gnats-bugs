. define:: expected type annotation after 2 terms in: (define: h Natural 0)

1. h is NOT a term 
2. The type is in the SECOND position, what gives?

 First, the error message is automatically generated by `syntax-parse'.

 How is `h' not a term?  What general name would you use?

 I don't understand this comment.

 Perhaps it should say 'third position' instead.=20

 Natural is a type. So how can it not be a type annotation?=20

 I'll let Ryan (cc'ed) decide how to handle this.

 The obvious alternative error message is:
 
 define:: expected : in: Natural
 
 highlighting the occurrence of `Natural'.  Is this preferable?
