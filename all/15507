Subject: Dr Racket will not release ffi-lib loaded DLLs until Dr Racket IDE closes.

>Description:
The documentation reads: "Due to the way the operating system performs dynamic binding, loaded libraries are associated with Racket (or DrRacket) for the duration of the process. Re-evaluating ffi-lib (or hitting the Run button in DrRacket) will not force a re-load of the corresponding library."

This is a major problem for anyone wanting to use Dr Racket to develop against native code that is also actively under development. A change to the native code needs to push the new DLL to the location where Dr Racket will be using it, except that Dr Racket cannot use it without closing and reopening the whole Dr Racket IDE.

This happens even after clicking "Stop", and will continue to hold onto it until the whole IDE closes.

This is just an unreasonable workflow.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Use ffi-lib to open a dll from some location "X".
2. Use a cmd line to copy a "newer" dll onto the "old" one.

Observe that the copy fails b/c Dr Racket holds onto the DLL.
