>Description:
After downloading the Debian install script, I changed to the racket/bin directory and tried to run DrRacket. Here is the output:

~/code/racket/bin$ ./drracket
/home/driscoll/code/racket/bin/gracket: 1: ELF: not found
/home/driscoll/code/racket/bin/gracket: 2: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

I found 2 references to this bug in the IRC logs:
http://racket-lang.org/irc-logs/20120325.txt
http://racket-lang.org/irc-logs/20110829.txt

And one closed bug (12137) but the solution doesn't seem to address the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
* Download Debian-squeeze installer from Racket site
* Install from command-line using non-Unix style install
* Change to racket/bin directory
* Run ./drracket
>Fix:
