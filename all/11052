>Description:
In "7.3 Contracts on Functions in General", e.g. at 
http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/contracts-general-functions.html

the first paragraph says:

"To support other kinds of functions, Racket supplies additional contract constructors, notable ->."

Instead I believe it should be:

"To support other kinds of functions, Racket supplies additional contract constructors, notably ->*."

That is change both:
(a) "notable" to "notably" and
(b) "->" to "->*"
