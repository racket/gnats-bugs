>Description:
In OSX Racket 5.1.0.4, the size of listbox entries does not reflect the initialization font.  The size is correct in OSX Scheme 4.2.5 as well as Windows 4.2.5 and 5.1.0.4.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/gui

; rather than racket/gui because I tried 4.2.5 versions

(define (control-font added-size)
  (let ((sz (send normal-control-font get-point-size))
        (fm (send normal-control-font get-family)))
    (or  (and sz
              fm
              (make-object font% (+ sz added-size) fm))
         normal-control-font)))

(define frame
  (new frame%
       [ width 300 ]
       [ height 900 ]
       [ label "listbox size" ]))

(for ((increase (in-range 0 20 5)))
  (new list-box%
       [ font (control-font increase) ]
       [ parent frame ]
       [ label (format "+~a" increase) ]
       [ choices (for/list ((a (in-range 10)))
                   "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")]))

(send frame show #t)
