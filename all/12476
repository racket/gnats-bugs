>Description:
Clicking the Scribble PDF button yields the 
contract violation shown below (after 
correctly rendering the document). Looks like
a very simple fix in drracket-buttons.rkt, 
but I don't know whether it's better to 
change the contract or the code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put this in the def'ns. window:

#lang scribble/base

@title{Here is the title}

Here it is.


Click on the "Scribble PDF" button, see this 
contract violation:
