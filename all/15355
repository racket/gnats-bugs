Having DrR check the file when re-running it for external modifications
is really good for working with different editors, but doing the check
at that time is pretty limited.  The most obvious example is when you
edit the file and DrR will let you do so and only face the choice when
you're about to save it (when it's too late since now you need to choose
which edits to lose).

It would be much nicer to do what Emacs does, and test the file in two
places:

1. When saving the file, to avoid conflicts (which DrR is doing now)

2. When a clean buffer is touched, ie, when it's about to change state
   to dirty.

I generally see more people using multiple editors, so this will
probably become more and more important.  That's in addition to some
editors that go further and just make the buffer represent what's in the
file -- which (I think) adds these two items to the above:

3. Also do a check when the application is focused.

4. Make reverting happen automatically.
