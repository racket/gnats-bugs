 Hi Spencer,
 
 It is not really possible to fix this with current DrRacket. FrTime
 uses a custom GUI widget to do the updating, but a #lang can't load
 GUI modules into DrRacket the way a language level (as accessed by the
 "Choose a Language Dialog") can. I've talked to Robby about this and
 my understanding is that doing so would greatly compromise DrRacket's
 security.
 
 We could imagine adding the widget to DrRacket always, but that would
 be an abuse of power in my mind and we should think about a better
 API.
 
 Jay

 Indeed, right now DrRacket has a security hole in that it trusts snips that
 are results of computations (and it really shouldn't). I can close this
 hole and then frtime's snips should work fine, but I just haven't found the
 time to do so. Roughly, the idea is that I need to build a little kill-safe
 abstraction that forward's events that come to DrRacket back over to the
 user's program for handling and then forward new bitmaps (that correspond
 to new ways that the snips look) back to DrRacket.
