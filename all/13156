>Description:
In looking to build/compile Racket from source (on Windows), it took a few minutes of google searches to eventually wind up at the online source before I found the instructions (https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/src/README). 

Please add a direct link from the documents page (http://docs.racket-lang.org/) and perhaps create an html version.

Thanks!

 The toplevel README file has a line saying
 
   Instructions for building Racket from source are in src/README.
 
 which, in fact, I got reminded of that because the first result when I
 googled for "build racket from source" was the README file from the
 github repo page.

 That will be problematic since the sources are usually not
 distributed.

 So how about an entry on the docs.racket-lang.org page (Build Racket from
 source) to a simple HTML doc saying something like:
 
 For instructions on how to build/compile Racket from source:
 - download the source (from here)
 - look in file "README".
 
 Along with perhaps something that says:
 
 To see the online version of the README file click here.
 
 And even perhaps maybe links to the online README's for the specific
 platforms.
 
 A link to the github page is number #8 when I try "racket build on windows"
 on google. It seems I didn't get that far before I altered to "racket
 compile on windows", where I saw that #4 was a link to a google groups page
 that I saw had the link to the github. And then I had to hand alter the URL
 to get to the Windows specific instructions (specifically the
 prerequisites) for which I was looking.
 
 And I only resorted to google after looking and performing multiple
 document searches at docs.racket-lang.org.
 
 Yes it might have been easier if I had used the magic words "from source",
 or gone poking around the source in the first place (supposing it's
 available). But why should someone have to go to google for a link to
 google-groups (in my case) to a link to github (and not racket-lang.org) if
 they don't?

 Yes, I think it makes sense to add some pointers in the Inside
 documentation to src/README. Then a doc search could at least point you
 in the right direction.
