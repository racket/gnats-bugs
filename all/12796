>Description:
Racket reference manual section 3.10.2 Mutable List Functions has:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(mlist->list mlst) â†’ list?
  mlst : mlist?

Returns a newly allocated mutable list with the same elements as mlst.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shouldn't that read:
Returns a newly allocated immutable list with the same elements as mlst.
