>Description:
The error message for arguments of the wrong type given to big-bang's
to-draw has a strange English construction:

"to-draw: expects a width as natural number argument, given ..."

Should read: "expects a natural number as width argument, given ...".

Or: "expects width to be a natural number, given ...".


Only width and height (AFAIK) use this construction.  Other type errors
are reported as "expect a <type> as <nth> argument, given ...".

Or something else, but "width as natural number argument" isn't right.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require 2htdp/universe)

(big-bang #f
  (to-draw (Î» (_) '...) "not-a-number" "either"))
