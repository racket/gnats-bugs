>Description:
In a finalized application using

(application-about-handler handler)

to set the about handler has no effect (OS X 10.5.5), even though (current-eventspace-has-standard-menus?) returns #t. The application created using the distribution feature from DrRacket menu always shows the DrRacket about box and version number.

All other handlers seem to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an application with root menu on OS X and set the about handler to a procedure displaying a custom message box. Create a distribution image, mount it and launch the application. Check the about box. (Please contact me if you need an example application; I have only tested it with my large final app so far but can make a small sample if needed, of course.)
