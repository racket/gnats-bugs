>Description:
The following program:

#lang racket
(define-signature a1^ (a1))
(define-signature a2^ extends a1^ (a2))
(define-unit u (import a1^) (export) (init-depend a1^))
(compound-unit/infer
 (import  [A : a2^])
 (export)
 (link (() u A)))

Results in the error:
racket/collects/racket/unit.rkt:2188:17: link-record-linkid: contract violation
  expected: link-record?
  given: #f

It seems that calculating the init-dependencies of a compound-unit/infer form may not be correctly handling subtyping among signatures. Replacing either a2^ with a1^ in the compound-unit/infer form, or replacing compound-unit/infer with compound-unit both allow successful linking.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang racket
(define-signature a1^ (a1))
(define-signature a2^ extends a1^ (a2))
(define-unit u (import a1^) (export) (init-depend a1^))
(compound-unit/infer
 (import  [A : a2^])
 (export)
 (link (() u A)))
