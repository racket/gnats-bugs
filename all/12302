>Description:
In both 5.1.3, and today's 5.2.0.1:

I can't use an internal-define inside a begin-inside-an-if.

(If I use `cond` instead of `if`, everything is fine again.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(if false
    23
    (begin
      (define n 1)
      n))

; error: define: not allowed in an expression context

Reason>>> This is the intended semantics of `begin'.  The style guide
currently recommends `cond' for exactly this reason.

 Well shiver me timbers, I had no idea `begin` had two variants,
 depending on whether it was in a definition-position.  ...With the
 intro of internal-defines and the scheme/racket split, I'm quite
 surprised that `begin` doesn't introduce (and delimit) a new scope for
 any defines it contains.
 
 Anyway, thanks for the note... perhaps this'll be enough to nudge me
 from `if` to `cond` everywhere (as John Clements has been exhorting me
 to do, for a while...).
