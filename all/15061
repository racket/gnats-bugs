 This happens not infrequently. It is, if I understand correctly, a
 problem having to do with some kind of internal timeout inside the
 mred low-level GUI event handling having to do with the implementation
 of eventspaces.
 
 DrRacket tried to be quick by doing some short-circuiting but
 sometimes it isn't quick. If you open and close a window, you might
 find it appears after that.
 
 I'm unsure of the right strategy to make this reliable, tho.
 
 Matthew: should I just avoid using on-demand to manage this and
 instead track the open frames and edit their menus when the content
 changes? I'm happy to do that, if it will make this problem go away.
 
 I'm unsure how to check to see if my theory is right, however. Am I
 right that there's a timeout? Is there a log message I can put
 somewhere so that I can try to correlate when the timeout expires and
 when DrRacket is adjusting the submenu?

 Hm. I just tried playing around with this a bunch. In particular, I
 stuck a call to (collect-garbage) inside the test that checks to see
 if the menu needs to be updated. And so I was seeing it take a long
 time to finish the callback, but the menu items weren't disappearing.
 So probably there is something else going on here that I don't
 understand.
