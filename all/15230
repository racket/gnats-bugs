>Description:
When check-expect fails, the actual and expected values are each printed with the characters reversed.

(Also, blank lines are printed within each error, rather than between errors, which make the output confusing to read.)
>How-To-Repeat:
The program

#lang racket
(require test-engine/racket-tests)
(check-expect 12345 67890)
(check-expect "abcde" "fghij")
(check-expect '(a b c) '(d e f))
(test)

produces the output:

0 checks passed.
