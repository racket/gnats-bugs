>Description:
Occasionally, I observe that Help Desk (and essentially, net/send-url) does not properly open the web site that I ask it to.  My browser's set to Chrome, and when the bug occurs, the web browser opens up, but its location does not appear to be set.

I have not been able to reproduce this reliably: it happens every so often, and I haven't figured out the pattern yet.

 Ok, I have a reproducible example now.  Put the following program in DrRacket:
 
     #lang racket
     syntax-rules
 
 Hover the cursor over "syntax-rules", and press F1.  The browser
 should open up the main documentation page, rather than the search
 page for syntax-rules.
 
 The problem is not send-url: it's somewhere in DrRacket.  I augmented
 send-url to print out what URLs were being opened, and it's dutifully
 receiving as the input URL the main documentation page.

 The error is somewhere within classify-position, which misclassifies
 the "syntax-rules" identifier as a "keyword", which help desk doesn't
 search.  So there are two bugs here:
 
     1.  Help desk should also search keywords,
     2.  classify-position is breaking somewhere

 Ok, read more code.  I have to assume the classification is as
 intended, as racket-lexer-wrapper adds an additional rule to
 tokenization: if the token in question is listed in the indentation
 rules as a keyword, it recategories the token as a "keyword".
 
     http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/blob/HEAD:/collects/framework/private/racket.rkt#l1308
 
 
 Assuming that classify-position is actually correct, then the bug is
 that Help Desk should also search keywords.  I also think that the
 search functionality should be expanded to include 'hash-colon-keyword
 types as well.
 
 
 Here's the patch.  Awaiting feedback before I merge this in.
