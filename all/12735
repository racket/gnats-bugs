>Description:
As it is, it's easy to create a plot in which there is nowhere good to place a legend. It's especially painful to try to place legends for contour plots, which often have 5-6 entries.

More generally, it would be nice to be able to render the pieces of a plot separately, in a way that they fit nicely together using pict combiners or similar.
