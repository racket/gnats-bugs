>Description:
It seems like the longer my Dr Racket has been running the more slowly the set font size buttons in the preferences pane respond. Using the buttons themselves has a significant effect. At this time of year where I switch back and forth between lecture font size and work font size I have to restart Racket at least once a week to get the buttons to work fast enough.

 Although it's difficult to be sure, we have fixed some problems for the
 next release that I think are likely to solve this problem.
 
 Please let us know how well the next version works after you upgrade.
 The next version isn't released, yet, but if you'd like to try it out a
 little early, here's a page with the current release candidates:

 Thanks!

Reason>>> 5.2 has now been released, which may fix the problem.
