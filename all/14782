>Description:
I have the problem detailed below - corrupt file.

I would love:
(a) a way to recover the plain text code, possibly minus images, from the file
(b) any reasonable way to figure out what is wrong with the file?
(c) a clue how to debug / fix this.

Racket 6.1 on Windows 7 or Linux Mint 17 mounting a working directory via cifs from Windows Server 2008.

Student reports an error (written below). expected string?, given #"".

Searching the file produces no literal #"".
Quote of error:

Error Loading

There was an error loading /the/file.rkt.

open-input-string: contract violation
  expected: string?
  given: #""


[OK]

Entire 3MB file in case people actually look at this:

>How-To-Repeat:
Not reproducible. Two students in the last week have experienced similar file corruption. I can't tell from looking at the file whether it is truncation or ?.

Platform: could be Racket 6.01 on Linux Mint 17 or Windows 7, or student could have worked at home (not likely).
