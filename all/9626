>Description:
Page 1.15 located at C:\Program Files\PLT\doc\htdp-langs\beginner-prim-ops.html does not respond smoothly to the scroll bar.  Sometimes the page is frozen and at other times it scrolls rapidly for a large number of lines.  I have experienced this on the machine from which I am sending this bug report as well as on a Dell D620 laptop running XP Pro service pack 3.
>How-To-Repeat:
In HtDP Beginner language select help -> helpdesk ->how to design programs languages ->1.15 Primitive Operations.  Then attempt to scroll down the page with either the scroll bar or the mouse scroll wheel.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 03 Feb 2012 15:28:37 -0500
Reason>>> The referenced page no longer exists, the problem can't be
replicated, and this was almost certainly a browser bug.


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:40:58 -0500
Reason>>> samth closed
