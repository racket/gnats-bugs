>Description:
The command line macro does not seem to executing it's handlers. Specifically, we are using the #:once-each keyword argument to command-line, and while running racket filename.rkt --help prints the correct arguments with their correct descriptions, passing those arguments doesn't execute any of the associated handlers passed as the third item of the list for each argument, effectively rendering the arguments useless. This: https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/67a9889ef750ce88139e17da6d8f807adcccc68e/racket/collects/racket/cmdline.rkt version of the command-line macro, from an earlier release, has the correct behaviour on the same calling code, and as a temporary fix we are using that version of the code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add to a file:
(command-line
 #:program-name "program"
 #:once-each
 [("-f") "A flag"
  (println "This actually executes!")])
And then run it from the command line with:
racket myfile.rkt -f

 I think something has gotten mangled in your bug report's example.
 There's a `#:program-name` where you mean `#:program`, and a `println`
 where you may mean `displayln`.
 
 Can you send the exact program that you're trying?
 
 I tried
 
  #lang racket
  (command-line
   #:program "program"
   #:once-each
   [("-f") "A flag"
    (displayln "This actually executes!")])
 
 but that worked as expected.
 
 Wild guess: if you used `print` instead of `displayln` (so that there's
 no newline after the output), then the problem may have to do with
 output buffering instead of command-line handling.
 
 (I'm puzzled that the version of "cmdline.rkt" mentioned below would
 behave differently for your example, but I think it will work best if
 we first make sure we're using the same example.)
