>Description:
So, I'm running a big-bang animation that displays the mouse location as an ordered pair.  If I move the mouse to the very top of the picture, it's a 0 y-coordinate, as expected.  If I move it slightly higher, onto the window's title bar, the y-coordinate abruptly jumps to -7.

Which messes up an animation that doesn't expect to ever get negative coordinates from the mouse.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (handle-mousex old-posn mouse-x mouse-y event)
  (make-posn mouse-x mouse-y))
(define (handle-draw where)
  (place-image (text (format "(~a,~a)" (posn-x where) (posn-y where)) 18 "blue")
               200 200
               (scene+line (rectangle 400 400 "solid" (make-color 192 64 0))

 Stephen, I don't understand this bug report. The docs clearly state that 'leave' and 'enter' events can generate negative numbers. We have been around this many times, and I am reluctant to change it again.

If the answer is "it'll behave a little oddly until you've learned conditionals and can check what kind of event you got," I guess I can live with that.

 Oh, OK.  This came up in the context of an animation I wanted my students to be able to do before they've seen conditionals, so they can't check what kind of event it is.  If the answer is "it'll behave a little oddly until you've learned conditionals and can check what kind of event you got," I guess I can live with that.
