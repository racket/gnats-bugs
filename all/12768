>Description:
In the Racket Reference manaul section 8. Pattern matching it has as its second example:
(match '(1 '(x y z) 1)
    [(list a b a) (list a b)]
    [(list a b c) (list c b a)])


->  '(1 '(x y z))

This works fine, but is the second quote in the val-expr a misprint and is this what was intended.

(match '(1 (x y z) 1)
    [(list a b a) (list a b)]
    [(list a b c) (list c b a)])

-> '(1 (x y z))
