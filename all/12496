>Description:
The DrRacket language dialog can cause the following Gdk assertion failure:

Gdk: IA__gdk_window_thaw_updates: assertion `impl_window->update_freeze_count > 0' failed
>How-To-Repeat:
First, move ~/.racket/racket-prefs.rktd out of the way. (This is important to make the language groups start out closed.)

Start DrRacket from a terminal. Click the "Choose language ..." menu item in the Languages menu. The language dialog opens with all of the language groups (eg "How to Design Programs") closed.

Click on the arrow to the left of "How to Design Programs" to open that language group. At this point, the Gdk assertion failure message is printed to the terminal.

(The assertion failure seems to happen only when the first language group is opened, whichever it is. Opening a second one does not cause the assertion failure to be printed again. However, canceling and re-opening the dialog resets the language groups to closed, and opening the first language group causes the assertion to be printed again.)

 This error is the bane of my (students') existence; the upper button pane stops rendering, and many of them have simply learned to guess where the buttons are supposed to be.
