 Hi Talik,
 
 
 More information may help track down why DrRacket is failing for you.
 
 Questions:
 
   * Have you used previous versions of DrRacket?  If so, have they
 quit out in the same way?
 
   * Do you see a particular error message when DrRacket closes?  Any
 notes on what you see when it closes up would be very useful.
 
   * According to the content on the bug report, I see that you're
 using a teaching language.  Are you using a school computer, or a home
 computer?
 
   * Is the error reproducible, or does it happen sporadically?
 
 Any bit of information here would be appreciated.  Otherwise, there's
 very little we can do to follow up on this bug report.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by dyoo at Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:58:45 -0500
Reason>>> Closing bug report until we get additional feedback from Talik.  At the 
moment, the bug report has no information we can use to trace the problem.  
If we get additional information from the original poster, we can reopen this 
bug report.
