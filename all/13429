 There is a `table' function in
 macro-debugger/syntax-browser/pretty-helper which has 5 arguments, and
 at least one recursive call it does to itself has only 4 inputs.
 Looks like it was broken in 039abedc.
 
 (BTW, there's also a weird definition for `syntax->datum/tables' which
 is exactly the same as `table'.  It's also mis-commented .)
