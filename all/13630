>Description:
I have two files, client.rkt and run-client.rkt, that are as follows:

client.rkt:

  #lang racket
  (require racket/place/distributed) 
  (provide cmd-line spawn-node)

  (define (cmd-line)
    (let-values ([(t _) (spawn-node)])
      (sync (thread-dead-evt t))))

  (define (spawn-node)
    (start-message-router/thread #:nodes (list (after-seconds +inf.0 0))))

run-client:

  #!/usr/bin/env racket
  #lang racket
  (require "client.rkt")
  (cmd-line)

If I execute '(cmd-line)' from the REPL or I run "./run-client.rkt" from the shell I get the error:
  tcp-listen: listen failed
    port number: 6340
    system error: Address already in use; errno=48

However if I open "run-client.rkt" in DrRacket and hit the "Run" button, I get this error:

  send: no such method
    method name: get-host-name
    class name: derived-from-derived-from-derived-from-...cts/racket/trait.rkt:509:6

If I modify the body of "client.rkt" to contain the line '(cmd-line)' and execute the program I get the origional error:

  tcp-listen: listen failed
    port number: 6340
    system error: Address already in use; errno=48
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Save "client.rkt" and "run-client.rkt" in the same directory
2. open "client.rkt" in DrRacket, hit "Run", then exectute "(cmd-line)" in the REPL. Observer the error.
3. Open "run-client.rkt" and hit "Run". Observe error.
4. run '(cmd-line)' in the REPL. Observe error.
