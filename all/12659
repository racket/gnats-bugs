>Description:
The following produces an error that it shouldn't:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#lang racket
(struct str (v)
  #:transparent
    
  #:property prop:custom-write
  (lambda (a-str port mode)
    (let ([recur (case mode
                   [(#t)
                    (lambda (p port)
                      (write p port))]
                   [(#f)
                    (lambda (p port)
                      (display p port))]
                   [else
                    (lambda (p port)
                      (print p port mode))])])
      (recur (str-v a-str) port))))

(define-values (in out) (make-pipe-with-specials))

(write (str "hello world") out)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The error that appears is internal: 

    user port write: expected result of type <non-negative exact integer, #f, or evt>; given #t

If the code above makes a regular pipe without specials support, it does the right thing, so the bug seems isolated to the implementation of the specials port.

 Ok, bug traced.  The bug is in the definition of
 make-pipe-with-special's write function, which is returning #t rather
 than 0, right here:
