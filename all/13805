>Description:
The error apparently happens in converting the struct type to an impersonator contract. Doing any of these to the program in reproduction steps causes TR to run without raising the error:

 * Removing (provide (all-defined-out))
 * Making the struct monomorphic with any manual instantiation for V
 * Removing the #:mutable keyword from the struct type definition
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket/base
(provide (all-defined-out))
(struct: (V) My-Box ([value : V]) #:mutable)

 I tried to reproduce this bug on three machines without any luck. Two on
 Linux with v5.3.900.1 and Windows with v5.3.4. Do you still get the
 error?

 If I remember correctly there was a similar bug (likely the same) that
 I fixed. It was that an internal function I added and called with the
 wrong keyword.
