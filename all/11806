>Description:
When canceling selection by moving the caret (i.e. without holding SHIFT), HOME, UP and LEFT move the caret wrt the selection start regardless of the caret's last position. END, DOWN and RIGHT move the caret wrt the selection end regardless of the caret's last position. Worst use-case: after selecting more than a page of text downward, pressing LEFT scrolls the document. (Symmetric case: select upward, press RIGHT.)

When canceling, UP and DOWN move the caret as expected. But LEFT and RIGHT only cancel the selection - they don't actually move the caret. No worst use-case, just a little surprising.

When extending or shrinking the selection by moving the caret (holding SHIFT), END correctly moves the caret wrt its last position, but HOME moves the caret wrt the selection start. End result: it's impossible to shrink a selection using SHIFT+HOME. Worst use-case: a user who is used to the caret always moving wrt its last position can easily do a quick multi-key action that deletes extra text, and not realize that it happened, or know how it happened.
>How-To-Repeat:
These reproduction steps are for HOME and END only.

Write this in DrRacket's editor:

    line1
    line2

Place the caret anywhere on line1 and press SHIFT+DOWN. Then press HOME. DrRacket will properly clear the selection, but move the caret to the beginning of line1, even though the caret was last on line2.

Place the caret anywhere on line1 and press SHIFT+DOWN. Then press SHIFT+HOME. DrRacket will extend the selection to include the beginning of line1 even though the caret was last on line2.

Place the caret anywhere on line2 and press SHIFT+UP. Then press END. DrRacket will move the caret to the end of line2, even though the caret was last on line1.

 End is also broken in the same way when you S-up to select and then
 use it.  IIUC, this is all a behavior that mimics the (common?) Mac
 thing where the selected text is viewed as a large caret, even when it
 spans multiple lines.  This is in contrast to the common windows
 behavior where the caret is always between two characters, at either
 edge of the selection.  On linux I see some applications that behave
 as in the Mac version, but mostly they do the windows thing.
 
 (It's even worse with M-left and M-right -- the resulting selection
 cannot shrink once that's done.  Extremely frustrating when I edit
 code in class.)
 
 In any case, +1 to this being a bug...  It should be a settable
 preference with a default that goes according to the OS in use.

 Yes, it is a bug, Eli.
 
 Also: the real issue is that there is some state that is currently
 only accessible at a layer lower than the layer where the keybindings
 are implemented. I've started fixing this, but got side tracked. I
 should get back on track some time before I die. Maybe.

 (Ah, I didn't realize that the current behavior is a bug!  I thought
 that it was the preferred behavior on Macs, and that the only bug is
 the lack of a settable preference...)
