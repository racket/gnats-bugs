Streams from the racket/stream library print their internal
representation.

At the command-line, it prints an opaque thing as expected:

#<stream>

 Please supply a complete program. I'll start. Put
 
   #lang racket
 
 in the definition window. Choose the "module" language. Hit Run. See
 this in the REPL:
 
   > (stream-cons 1 '())
   #<stream>
 
 This is with the default printer settings (and it looks the same with
 the 'write' setting). With the 'Constructor' setting, I see this:
 
   > (stream-cons 1 '())
   (stream ...)

 That was with a blank definitions area. Sorry, I can't seem to reproduce
 this on a clean build though so it may have just been some weirdness in
 my working copy. I'll close the bug if I can't figure out a way to
 reproduce it.

 You mean without a #lang racket in there?
 
 I see that if I open a new window and don't hit "Run" then the REPL is
 printing things in a strange way:
 
 > (stream-cons 1 '())
 #(struct:stream
   {eager
    .
    #(struct:stream-pare
      #(struct:stream {lazy . #<procedure>})
      #(struct:stream {lazy . #<procedure>}))})
 
 Maybe that's what you did?

 Oh, that's the same printout as you have, I think. the {}s are for mcons's.

 Ah, yes, that's exactly it. I didn't notice what I was doing since it
 was habit.
