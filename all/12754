>Description:
Hi,

With the code below, clicking on the button does not make the frame disappear on MacOS X (I don't have it myself but at least 2 people have reported this to me for the script plugin, so I asked them to test this code and reported it doesn't work indeed).


#lang racket/gui

(define fr (new frame% [label "Test frame"]
                [style '(float)] ; comment me?
                ))

(define b (new button% [parent fr][label "Hide me"]
               [callback (λ _ (send fr show #f))]))

(send fr show #t)
; then click on the button
