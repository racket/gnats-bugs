 The bug is in syntax-colorer/module-lexer.rkt (and maybe the
 scheme-lexer needs to be extended or maybe not -- I'm not completely
 clear on what exactly the invariants of read-language are wrt to
 malformed #lang lines (probably because I need to go re-read the
 docs).
 
 Anyways, I'll take a look into it later on.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
