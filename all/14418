>Description:
Let's open some random documentation page, like http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html - if we click on a function name, we get it's anchor name, which is quite weird, for example for `xor` it is:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fbool..rkt%29._xor%29%29

instead of just:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html#xor

I propose to implement the latter anchor names for every function in the documentation. This change might break backwards compatibility, for example, StackOverflow links to Racket documentation, therefore, old anchor names should be retained too.

 Unfortunately, large parts of the other parts of the name are
 required, at least sometimes. For example, `xor` could be defined
 multiple places, and so there's the defining file name in the anchor
 -- here (lib racket/bool.rkt). Plus there are other kinds of anchors,
 which Scribble distinguishes by not using the (def ...) portion.
 
 These could certainly be simplified during HTML generation when
 there's only one thing called "xor", but that presents the problem
 that if you add another thing named "xor" on the same page, something
 has to change, potentially breaking links.
 
 If you have an encoding of the same information that looks nicer, that
 would be great, but it might be harder than it looks.
