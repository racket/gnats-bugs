>Description:
The collect-info struct listed in the Scribble documentation at
http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/core.html?q=collect-info#%28def._%28%28lib._scribble%2Fcore..rkt%29._collect-info%29%29

is listed as having only 8 fields, but the actually implementation has 9 as defined in scribble/core.rkt as

(define-struct collect-info (fp ht ext-ht ext-demand parts tags gen-prefix relatives parents) #:transparent)

Similarly the resolve-info struct in the documentation at 
http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/core.html?q=resolve-info#%28def._%28%28lib._scribble%2Fcore..rkt%29._resolve-info%29%29

is listed as having only 3 fields, but in its implementation in scribble/core.rkt it has 4 as in

(define-struct resolve-info (ci delays undef searches) #:transparent)
>How-To-Repeat:
Compare the current documentation for the collect-info and resolve-inof structs with their implementations in scribble/core.rkt
