>Description:
When you run the below program, 
drracket highlights the occurrence 
of 'not-a' in the signature and says 

 reference to metafunction not-a before its definition

which left me confusded for a second. 
I am sure it will leave students confused
for much longer. 

I'd like to see the not-a in the test line to be painted red.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require redex)

(define-language Bug
  (bug ::= a))

(test-equal (term (not-a a)) #f)

(define-metafunction Bug 
  not-a : bug -> boolean 
  [(not-a a) #f])
