>Description:
In gr2, there are several issues with the behavior of slideshow -n.  All of these are on Linux/Gtk.

1. Running a slideshow file with slideshow -n starts with the slides in the upper-left corner, but then when the slides have finished loading, the initial slide jumps to the center of the screen.

2. The remainder of the display is gray in the first part of (1), but then changes to black when the slides are centered.

3. Overall, blanking the remainder of the display on -n is worse than the pre-GR2 behavior, which simply had a window with no decoration of the appropriate size.
