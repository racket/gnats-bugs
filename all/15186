 Thanks for the report! I've pushed a change to `racket/gui` to disable
 a change to scrolling that clearly isn't working right for you. If
 you'd like to adjust your installation manually, change
 `SCROLL-VIA-COPY?` to `#f` in "gui-lib/mred/private/wxme/editor-canvas.rkt".
 
 Can you tell me more about the size and resolution of your display? In
 particular, is it a HiDPI display? Does changing the hight of
 DrRacket's window change the behavior, or is it the same for all
 heights?

 I think I wasn't seeing this because I had "Always show the #lang line"
 preference disabled.
 
 When you see the line repeated, is it always the "#lang" line that
 DrRacket keeps at the top of the editor? Or do you have that disabled,
 too?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 26 Nov 2015 15:36:27 -0500
Reason>>> 

I believe that these two commits have turned back on Matthew's 
performance optimization and fixed up a few problems in the framework 
in drracket so you shouldn't see strange artifacts anymore.
