 The FPU tests I pushed yesterday fail only with this error. That means 
 two bits of good news:
 
   * The tests are exhaustive with special values and get good coverage
     otherwise, so this is likely the only IEEE-compliance issue left.
 
   * DrDr's floating-point hardware and C library functions are good
     (except `pow', which is bad almost everywhere).
