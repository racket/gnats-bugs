>Description:
When cutting multiple S-expressions using C-u <number> M-C-k, only the last S-expression is cut, while the others are just deleted.  In Emacs, all of them are put into the clipboard.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a new DrRacket window, type something like:

(a b) (c d) (e f)

Move the cursor to the start of the line and type C-u 2 M-C-k C-y.  Only "(c d)" is pasted, while Emacs pastes "(a b) (c d)" with those commands.
