>Description:
Hex digit conversion is 10 low for hex digits a..f or A..F.  This happens in an locally defined function in a MySQL private module, so I don't know if anyone's run into this yet.
>How-To-Repeat:
The locally defined function hex-digit->int returns 2 instead of 12 for input #\C, and 5 instead of 15 for input #\f.  I found this out when I did a search for hex digit conversion before I reinvented the wheel.  I borrow the function I found, but when I tested it, I found the bug.

 This is my recoded version of hex-digit->int, which seems to work.  All I did was add -10 in two places.
 
 (define (hex-digit->int c)
   (let ([c (char->integer c)])
     (cond [(<= (char->integer #\0) c (char->integer #\9))
            (- c (char->integer #\0))]
           [(<= (char->integer #\a) c (char->integer #\f))
            (- c (char->integer #\a) -10)]
           [(<= (char->integer #\A) c (char->integer #\F))
            (- c (char->integer #\A) -10)])))
