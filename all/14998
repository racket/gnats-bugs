>Description:
Type exactly the following:

  1. "123" on a fresh line
  2. Home, to go the beginning
  3. Alt+Shift+Right, to select it
  4. Alt+Shift+9, to wrap it in parens
  5. Alt+Shift+Right, to select the "123" again

What happens with the last interaction is that the selection covers the
"(123" part.  It looks like after the paren openning thing (#4) there is an
invisible selection on the open "(", and #5 extends and shows it instead of
setting it.

 (BTW, this is something I run often into in class when I want to convert
 some E to (let ([x E]) ...) -- and it's even more confusing because it
 happens when doing the double-open paren of the ([...]).  I've run into
 it for years, causing me to either end up with a bogus expression or
 stop and restart a new line.)
