>Description:
This is about the Web page of the Racket Bugs' base.

In the results of the queries of the Bugs' base, in IE9 and IE8 the dark rows are black so the text is unreadable.

See: http://imgur.com/TLGkx


The problem is that the bgcolor attribute of those rows are set to "#ccc". If it is set to "#cccccc" the problem disappears and they have the same color that in Chrome.

now: <tr valign=top bgcolor="#ccc">
change to: <tr valign=top bgcolor="#cccccc">
>How-To-Repeat:
Open "Internet Explorer 8" or "Internet Explorer 9".

Go to http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?debug=&database=default&cmd=quick+query .

Press the button "submit query".
