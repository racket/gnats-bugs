Apparently, a macro that generates contracts doesn't have `promise?' defined in its context.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module provider typed/racket
  (provide three)
  (define three (delay 3)))

(module requirer typed/racket
  (require 'provider))


Running this results in

  promise?: unbound identifier in module in: promise?

 The original test program works now, but this one doesn't:
 
 #lang racket/load
 
 (module provider racket
    (provide three)
    (define three (delay 3)))
 
 (module requirer typed/racket
    (require/typed
     'provider
     [three  (Promise Integer)]))
 
 
 Type Checker: Type (Promise Integer) could not be converted to a 
 contract. in: (Promise Integer)

 That's the same error I get from (require math/bigfloat) in my Racket 
 repo. (Except it's a (Promise Bigfloat).) Almost there!
