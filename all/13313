>Description:
On Windows Vista, in DrRacket (at least), a modal dialog is not brought to the front and given focus when the parent (DrRacket) window is clicked. Focus is taken away from the foreground task but not completely given to the modal dialog. 

In similar circumstances, other applications flash the parent's title bar, bring the modal dialog to the front, and send forcus to the modal dialog.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket.
Launch File->Search in Files dialog.
Launch another window (e.g. Windows Command shell window), and position (and size) the new window such that it obscures the search dialog, but not all of the DrRacket window.
Click on DrRacket window.
Observe focus leaves the shell window but the search dialog is not brought to the front and given focus.
