>Environment:
linux-ubuntu
>Description:
Not sure if this is a problem with the build system or the documentation.  When doing a unix-style install, the intermediate build output directory is not automatically created.  Either the build system should create it, or the INSTALL file should be updated to indicate that the user should create it manually.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following command:

make DESTDIR=mybuild unix-style PREFIX=/usr/local

This fails with the following error:

./racketcgc -cqu ../../racket/mkincludes.rkt "mybuild/usr/local/include/racket" "../../racket" .

Manually creating the "racket/src/build/racket/mybuild" directory causes the build to succeed, but there's no indication of this to the user.  The user would be more likely to attempt to create the directory "mybuild" directly under the repository root.

 DESTDIR doesn't need to be created first, but it needs to be an
 absolute path. I'll clarify in the documentation and possibly also add
 a check in the makefile.
