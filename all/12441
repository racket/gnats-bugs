>Description:
When I access the Racket documentation thru the DrRacket "help"button and the document comes up in a browser tab (I've tried both Opera and Firefox on Windows Vista) the Racket icon is not displayed in the browser tab.  (If I access the documentation through the Racket website  the icon does appear correctly in the browser tab).

 To fix this, we need to do the following:
 
 Put the icon someplace in the documentation tree.
 Add <link rel="shortcut icon" href="...somewhere.ico..." /> to the
 <head> section of all scribble pages.

 It's unlikely that there's anything to do about this.  Browsers in
 general (and on Windows in particular) like to show an icon that
 corresponds to how the file icon looks like when you view local
 content.  I just did a quick experiment, and even on linux chrome
 doesn't show it (FF does).
