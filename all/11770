>Description:
If 'make clean' is run after the --disable-foreign option for configure, the make runs into what appears to be an infinite loop.  My 2GB ram system went from 500MB usage to 2GB, triggering a swap frenzy disk-thrashing.

Slackware 13.0
>How-To-Repeat:
In build directory:

1. ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/racket --enable-shared --disable-foreign --with-x

2. make

Make errors out at some point (I no longer have the stderr output available on my terminal).
Decide possible error cause is the --with-x option, so decide to rerun configure without it.  In preparation to rebuild:

3.  make clean

Thousands of lines scroll past, memory use jumps before I realise.  Hit ctrl-z to suspend job.  'top' reports 4580 processes, of which roughly 4500 are stopped.  Kill backgrounded processes with 'kill %%'.   Memory returns to normal.

I'm unwilling to attempt to reproduce the problem to provide clearer error messages and exact output from 'make clean'.  I remember that the loop appeared to be in attempting to cd into a non-existent build/language (? or something like that) directory.
