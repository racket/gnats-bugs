 The source and DrRacket Preference docs say that's the intended behaviour.
 
 Looking at the rest of the "Background Color" tab other things are confusing,
  especially given the tab's name. I'll think about some concrete changes for
  your consideration.

 It's definitely a limitation of how DrRacket is parameterized over color.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 31 Oct 2015 06:56:38 -0400
Reason>>> 

Some not very recent change to DrRacket's color preferences set up 
have probably mitigated this change enough to be worth closing this PR 
now.
