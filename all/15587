>Description:
I've ran into this problem and believe it can be a source of confusion for students.

BSL accepts (string=? "red") without producing an error. It produce #true, which is not obvious.

A common mistake in a 'cond' line is to forget the parameter, like this:

 [(string=? "red") "green"]

The student's test cases look like:
(check-expect (blah "red") "green")

They are confused when the code runs but their test fails. The 'cond' line looks like a "red" should produce "green", just as the test shows. They cannot easily see that "string=?" is missing a 2nd argument.
>How-To-Repeat:
A common mistake for beginners in a 'cond' line is to forget the variable, like this:

 [(string=? "red") "green"]

The student's test cases look like:
(check-expect (blah "red") "green")

They are confused when the code runs but their test fails. The 'cond' line looks like a "red" should produce "green", just as the test shows. They cannot easily see that "string=?" is missing a 2nd argument. It's not intuitive at all that (string=? "red") should be valid code that produces #true.

 It turns out there are several string functions that suffer from this problem. 
 I’ll get to this issue later this week. — Matthias
