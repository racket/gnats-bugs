>Description:
So, if you are in DrRacket, and you have some text, for example

"(call-with"

and you use the complete word function (CTRL + /), it comes up with a box of seemingly unsorted results. 

Now, it's pretty smart since it can derive "default-continuation-prompt-tag" from the incorrect "default-prompt-" so that's great.

BUT

Here's where the problem lies.

Every time you type a character, it does a full search of what I imagine to be some list of reserved identifiers. This is terrible because if you start with "(call-with" it takes a significant amount of time to sift through the list for each letter after that. 

I'd like to see some settings related to this, maybe the ability to alphabetize results or something, and also I'd like for the search to be terminated if I type another letter, so that it doesn't take so long to get through a single function's name.
