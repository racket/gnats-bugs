>Description:
[I already sent a message on the mailing list, but Stephen De Gabrielle suggested me to use this bug report interface (which I didn't know it existed).]

I'm developing a toy application using sqlite via the db library and I'm experimenting frequent crashes of DrRacket.  I cannot say exactly what happens.  My feeling is that every time my program is stopped by an exception, then DrRacket crashes sooner or later in an apparently unrelated situation.

Hope this can be useful,
thanks for supporting Racket.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a small program that generate an exception (e.g. an invalid query)
Run the program a few times.
Do something else, rerun the program, etc.
At some point Racket crashes.


#lang racket

(require db)

(define db
  (sqlite3-connect #:database "test.sqlite"
                   #:mode 'create))

(unless (table-exists? db "people")
  (query-exec db
              "CREATE TABLE people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)"))

(query-exec db
            "INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES ('John')")
(query-exec db
            "INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES (?)"
            "Richard")
(query-list db
            "SELECT name FROM people")

;; Invalid query
(query-exec db
            "INSERT INTO people name VALUES ?")
