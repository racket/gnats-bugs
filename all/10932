>Description:
I have made a simple c program, 'test', which segfaults, and I was trying to run it through mzscheme. I ran into problems when system*/exit-code did not return a positive number, it returned -1, thus I could not pass the value in to exit to end the scheme program. Either this is the desired behavior and the documentation should be changed, or there is a bug.


>How-To-Repeat:
C program, test.c:
int main () {
    void* a = 0;
    int b = *((int*)a);
}

Shell:
//Automatic make target
make test

Scheme:
