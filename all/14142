>Description:
If a connection closes without a terminating \r\n, http-client throws the error "Connection ended early" and does not return a response. I am not 100% sure this is a bug, since it is handled very deliberately, but my (admittedly cursory) understanding of RFC 2616 4.4.5 is that connection termination is an acceptable means of terminating a response. More importantly, there are accessible pages live on the internet that browsers and other networking libraries can fetch but that http-client cannot for this reason.
>How-To-Repeat:
Request any page from a server that does not \r\n terminate its responses. I can provide a live example if required.
