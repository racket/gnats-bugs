>Description:
1) The contracts given for make-posn, posn-x and posn-y are too strict. For instance, "make-posn" is documented as "(number number -> posn)".

In all other functions that are documented like that it would be an error to call it with something that is not a number. Also, the posn? predicate says "true" to (posn (make-posn true false)).

According to the HTDP/2e methodology, these kinds of contracts would only be mentioned in one or many data definitions that accompany a structure.

2) The documentation for the beginners language mentions "posn: signature", but it is an error to evaluate "posn" in the beginners language.

 *Signatures* [let's use the new terminology please] in HtDP and 2e are NOT checked/enforced [*]. They are temporal and spatial agreements between programmers -- see for example 
 
  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part1.html#(part._data-uni._data-uni)
 
 It is extremely acceptable to experiment with function calls that violate signatures. 
 
 [*] Klaus, es gibt ein *checked signature* Packet, das auch in HtDP *SL existiert. Es ist dokumentiert in Deutsch (thank you Mike!) unter der Rubrik "Dein Program". Es ist allerdings (noch) nicht unterst�tzt in *SLs.

State changed from "closed" to "analyzed" by matthias at Wed, 09 May 2012 09:48:36 -0400
Reason>>> Robby pointed out that Klaus meant the documentation in the Racket source 
not the HtDP write-up. I will revise the documentation later today.
