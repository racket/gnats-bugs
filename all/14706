 In fact I had not, because I intended to run in-place and kind of skimmed
 the part of the readme that told me in somewhat oblique fashion to run make
 install anyway, and I am not used to this style of division of labor
 between make and make install and just ran make. So now that I have done a
 make install, which itself took all of the 6 hours since receiving your
 reply, everything is running at a reasonable speed. Thanks for the help.

 Maybe a different more standard set of make targets? Something like this:

 'make install' =3D just copies into destination, implies optim
 'make' =3D make optim
