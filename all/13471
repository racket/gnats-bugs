>Description:
Andrew Kuhnhausen reports that the following program takes a long time.  http://dpaste.org/FGB30/  In my evaluation, it's actually in an infinite loop.  Lexer-abbrev must make sure the abbreviation isn't cyclical, or else it hits this loop.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile the following program:


#lang racket

(require parser-tools/lex
         (prefix-in : parser-tools/lex-sre))
 
(define-lex-abbrev
  balanced (:or (:: "(" balanced ")" balanced)
                any-char))
 
(define balanced-lex
  (lexer
    [balanced (string-append lexeme (balanced input-port))]
    [(eof) ""]))
 
(balanced-lex (open-input-string "((abc))"))
