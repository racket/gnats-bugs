>Description:
I've recently discovered how to use auto completion in the DrRacket IDE, which is well and good, but it seems to only function for Racket primitives and important constructs. No user-defined procedures show up upon attempting auto completion in any given file.

Thanks.

* Attempt to use said procedure with auto-complete.
