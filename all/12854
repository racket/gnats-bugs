The following program does not work and gives an error, but if the provide line is uncommented it works.

-struct/dc: expected an identifier that names a field

 (module a racket
   (struct s (field))
   (provide s))
 
 (module b racket
   (require 'a) 
   (struct/c s any/c))
 
 vs 
 
 (module a racket
   (struct s (field))
   (provide s-field)
   (provide s))
 
 (module b racket
   (require 'a) 
   (struct/c s any/c))
