>Description:
When using any high contrast theme, the text in the toolbars remain black, making the text there unreadable. Because high contrast is considered to be helpful for people with certain handicaps, this could be an important issue depending on who uses the software.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open the ease of access center
2. Click make my computer easier to see
3. Choose a high contrast theme
4. Toolbars on DrRacket will become unreadable.
