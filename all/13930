>Description:
Whenever I try to run command line REPL for "plt-r5rs" scheme I get the error. I was told to write a bug report on the irc and so I do. Not sure what's the lifespan of pastes on pastebin, but if You ever need it I can upload/send You a new one - http://bpaste.net/show/116769/ .
I guess it is not system specific stuff, and so thinks Carl Eastlund, but have a very customized OS if that could matter - arch linux with stumpwm as the main window manager and urxvt as the terminal emulator.
In case of any questions I am willing to help.

 Ok, found the culprit. I was sure I didn't. But I made a change to the
 .racketrc file adding "(require readline)" or somehing like that.
 Nevertheless that was my fault, sorry for the trouble.
