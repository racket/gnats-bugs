>Description:
Instead, it opens an empty file.  However, if DrR is already open, double-clicking a .rkt file in MacOS DOES open that file.

I think I reported a similar bug several years ago, version 300-something.  I thought it had been fixed somewhere along the line, but I'm still seeing it in 5.1.3 and a nightly build of 5.1.3.11.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Quit DrR.
2) Double-click a .rkt file in the Finder.
3) Observe the empty file it opens.
4) Go back to the file and double-click that file again.
5) Observe that the desired file is now open.
