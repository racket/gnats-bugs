  (list-ref "I am not a list" 18)


Produces:

  list-ref: index 18 too large for list (not a proper list): "I am not a list"

If it's not a proper list, it's nonsense to say the index is too large.

 Any non-pair value is an improper list, so "nonsense" is wrong.
 
 But it sounds like a case for throwing an early error for non-pair
 inputs, since it won't work even for 0.

 That sounds like a great idea.
