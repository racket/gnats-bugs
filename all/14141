>Description:
It is really hard to use the documentation to discover how to configure a package so that once the package is installed, (require name) works.  I eventually figured it out by looking that the error message issued when 'require' fails.

I've been reading "Package Management in Racket (Beta)" especially the sections "Package Concepts" and "developing packages".  I've also been reading the documentation for `require`, which refer to "the module specified by *string*."  I would benefit greatly from a reference to the section that explains how *string* is resolved to a module.

I wound up guessing to install as package-name/require-name/main.rkt, which seems to work.

 Can you say if the new documentation makes it more clear?
 
 http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/pkg/getting-started.html
 
 I find the question hard to answer though, because packages are very
 flexible. If you had this package directory:
 
 P
 - info.rkt
 - M
 -- F.rkt
 
 Then it is possible that to get F, you could do:
 
 (require M/F) ;; info.rkt defines collection as 'multi
 (require P/M/F) ;; info.rkt defines collection as 'use-pkg-name
 (require X/M/F) ;; info.rkt defines collection as "X"
 
 The original design that the community rejected only allowed option
 one, which has the advantage of being easier to explain. The new
 flexibility is naturally more complicated to describe.
