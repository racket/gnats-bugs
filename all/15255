>Description:
I expect to see the accumulated lists so far, but I instead see the reverse of said lists. If the docs are right that is problematic because for/lists then does a lot of allocation as none of the lists can be shared, if the docs are wrong then its not nearly as useful.

http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html?q=for%2Flists#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._for%2Flists%29%29

The ids are bound to the lists accumulated so far in the for-clauses and bodys.
>How-To-Repeat:
(for/lists (l1 l2) ([i (in-range 4)]) (values i l1))

=>

'(0 1 2 3)
'(() (0) (1 0) (2 1 0))
