>Description:
(Perhaps this should be two separate issues?)

I'm just starting out with Racket, but I find it annoying that the interaction window clears itself when I click Run to "compile" the definitions. I often write something in the definitions frame and then attempt to use it by writing a function invocation in the interaction window, only to get the error: "WARNING: (Will Robinson) The definitions window has changed. Click Run."

Is there a reason the interaction frame has to be cleared on a compilation?

Couldn't there be an option to have the definitions, if changed, be automatically compiled when I press RETURN in the interaction pane? Of course this assumes the interaction pane wouldn't be cleared on compilation.

 Go to the very end first.
