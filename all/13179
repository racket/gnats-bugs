>Description:
I don't understand why the save keystroke (C-x C-s or C-s or whatever) in the interactions window prompts me to save the interactions window's content. I mean, I know *why* at a literal level. But I don't think I've wanted to save the interactions more than 3-4 times in ~15 years of using DrRacket. It's far more common to

- make edits in definitions
- click F5
- see the test output
- feel happy that the tests passed
- type the save keystroke

At this point I want to save my fixed definitions.  But I have to go back to definitions, save, then come back to interactions. It's an ugly affordance.

Since the uncommon case is already available via the File menu, why not map the save keys to always save definitions?

 I recommend you use control-s instead of control-x control-s.
