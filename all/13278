>Description:
I suppose this could be considered a software bug or a doc bug, but I contend it's the former:

Printing multiple pages to a pdf-dc% depends upon the value of its as-eps initialization variable (which, the docs say, is ignored).  If (per default) as-eps is #t, then the second call to (send <the pdf-dc%> start-page) produces this error: "start-page in pdf-dc%: cannot create multiple pages for encapsulated output: (wrapper-object:pdf-dc% ...)"

So, I believe the real error is that the code for multiple-pages-ok? in racket/draw/private is erroneously assuming the dc is a PostScript one.  I believe this change to racket/draw/private/post-script-dc.rkt fixes it, but I have only tested it against my own code and the "steps to reproduce" below, so please take with a grain of salt:

<     (define/public (multiple-pages-ok?) (not is-eps?))
---
>     (define/public (multiple-pages-ok?) (or pdf? (not is-eps?)))
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require racket/draw)

(define pdc (new pdf-dc%
                 [interactive #f]
                 [output "/tmp/pdf-dc-bug.pdf"]))
(send pdc start-doc "")
(send pdc start-page)
(send pdc end-page)
(send pdc start-page)
