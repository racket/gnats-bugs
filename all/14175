>Description:
`raco test` does not appear to see collections installed by packages, which includes parts of the "core" that are now in packages.

Example:
$ raco test --collection racket/gui
test: Collection "racket/gui" is not installed
  context...:

   /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/racket/collects/raco/main.rkt: [running body]

Compare to:
