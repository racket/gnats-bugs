>Description:
If you run "2.rkt" attached below from the `racket` executable, it will
produce the following error:

$ racket 2.rkt
module->namespace: module not instantiated in the current namespace
  name: #<resolved-module-path:"/home/asumu/code/gcr-bug/1.rkt">
  context...:
   /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/collects/racket/enter.rkt:33:0: do-enter!
   /home/asumu/code/gcr-bug/2.rkt: [running body]

If you remove the (#%require racket/unit) from "2.rkt", it will work
fine. If you remove the submodule require in "1.rkt", it will also start
working. If "2.rkt" is written in #lang racket (includes racket/unit), it
fails.

I also tried copying the contents of racket/unit to a separate file
(say "3.rkt") and requiring that instead. It seems to work fine in that case
(relative require or using `raco link`). Requiring an arbitrary file with
a submodule declaration (like what's contained in racket/unit) instead of
racket/unit also makes the problem go away. 

In DrRacket, it also does not error.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1.rkt

#lang racket/base

(#%require (submod racket/unit compat))

;; 2.rkt
#lang racket/base

(#%require racket/unit)
(#%require racket/enter)

(enter! "1.rkt")
