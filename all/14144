>Description:
Commit e513cdc1c445f7d2ca15ef7033caada29ccf63ff allows redefinition
at the top-level. This isn't sound on some examples:

-> (define x 'foo)
-> x
- : Symbol [generalized from 'foo]
'foo
-> (define x 'bar)
-> x
- : Symbol [generalized from 'foo]
'bar

TR should re-check the previously synthesized type when redefinition
happens. (this works correctly if there was a type annotation to
begin with)
