>Description:
I expect the following to error at some point. Likely that a struct/dc shouldn't be a flat contract if some of the fields are lazy.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket


(struct foo (v))


(define c
  (recursive-contract
    (struct/dc foo [v () #:lazy #:flat (or/c c symbol?)])
    #:flat))

(define/contract a-foo
  c
  (foo "h"))
(foo-v a-foo)
