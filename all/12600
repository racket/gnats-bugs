>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:


#lang typed/racket

(define-type (Treeof a) (Rec T (Listof (U a T))))

(: list-id (All (a) ((Listof a) -> (Listof a))))
(define (list-id xs) xs)

(: tree-id (All (a) ((Treeof a) -> (Treeof a))))
(define (tree-id xs)
  ((inst list-id (U a (Treeof a))) xs))


The type checker highlights the body of `tree-id' with this error:

Expected (Rec T (Listof (U a T)))
but got         (Listof (U a (Rec T (Listof (U a T)))))


Workaround: Unfold the return type of `tree-id' once; i.e.

(: tree-id (All (a) ((Treeof a) -> (Listof (U a (Treeof a))))))
