 I don't know which page has a problem, but:
 
 * If you're talking about the search page, there is some JS code that
   puts the focus in the search box, and that's still done right.
 
 * On all other pages,
   - the tab order is messed up anyway since the branding top part has
     links (and since it's a normal part of the web pages now, it makes
     sense to keep them),
   - the searches wouldn't be easily navigate-able anyway because the
     TOC links on the LHS precede them either way.

 I am talking about docs.racket-lang.org.
 
 I do not have links in my tabable selection, so neither the links at
 the top nor the TOC interfere it is only the google custom search.
 My tab order on docs.racket-lang.org.
 1. Google custom search text field
 2. Google custom search magnifying glass
 3. Version selector
 4. Manual search (top one)
 5. Manual search (bottom one)
 
 On my local docs it is just 4 and 5.

 What's a "tabable selection"?

 I don't know what the above is, and since I don't have it, I see what
 I expected everyone to see --
 
 * On the old docs I get the LHS links first
 
 * On docs.racket-lang.org I get the navbar links first, followed by
   the LHS links
 
 (I'm also using Chrome, BTW.)

 Chrome is configurable to what is selected when pressing tab.
 
 There is a checkbox in settings with the title: Pressing Tab on a
 webpage highlights links, as well as form fields. I don't have this
 checked.

 Sorry, but I don't have that configuration option, so I have no way to
 know what exactly it's doing.
 
 Based just on the name of this option, I don't know why the search box
 would even get focused, since it is a form element.  Or maybe it
 avoids focusing links and does only form elements, and in this case
 this sounds like a very odd setup to use...  But in any case I'm
 second-guessing a behavior that seems to be particular to your browser
 configuration, or at least one that I didn't hear about so far.
 
 Just to clarify why the change that I *think* this implies is not a
 good idea (doubly so if I can't test it): the google search box is
 hooked into the version box, making one up if there is none.  That is,
 on all pages, something that comes before the top links -- so one way
 to deal with this is to change the order, but this will most likely
 change the rendering of the text, and adding a version box where there
 is none would be much more fragile (since it will need to identify the
 navigation bar rather than a simple search for "<body>").
 
 Another obvious way to try it is to change the tabindex property --
 but IME this tends to be a bad idea: it is almost always surprising
 unless all elements get the property (since then it's always before
 everything or after everything), and it doesn't compose well (ie, when
 the contents is rendfered into some other html context).  The first
 point is especially bad, since it means that the expected order
 (expected by visual layout) will not be the one that gets used.
