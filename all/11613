>Description:
One of the basic plotting examples in the Quick Start:

(plot (shade 3dfun))

causes the following error message:

initialization for color%: bad argument combination: 512688213 0 255


==> Works for me in 5.0.2 <==
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require plot)


(define 3dfun (lambda (x y) (* (sin x) (sin y))))

(plot (shade 3dfun))
