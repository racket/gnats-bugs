>Description:
When running a 2htdp/universe program, once the stop-when function triggers, it never renders the final state of the world. See the program below for a minimal example.

(This came up in a game while teaching HtDP. The game displays a shinking circle, which grows each time the user clicks in it. If the circle reaches size 0, is replaced with the message "You lose." and the game stops. The obvious way to implement this is 1) by using a Natural for the world, 2) with stop-when triggering when the world is 0, and 3) rendering the 0 world as tye "You lose." message. But because stop-when prevents the final world from rendering, the message never appears and it stops with a tiny circle instead.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#|
This world starts out #false, then switches to #true after one tick. It stops
when the world becomes #true, which means it should run for only one tick. It
renders the #false world as a white rectangle, and then never renders the final,
#true world. Is this correct behavior?

(require 2htdp/universe)

 Could you use the optional last-picture argument to stop-when?

 Yes, that works. Thanks.
 
 Is this the intended behavior when last-picture is omitted? If so, I
 propose the documentation for (stop-when last-world?) to be updated to read:
 
 "Specifically, the clock is stopped; no more tick events, KeyEvent
 <https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28tech._world._keyevent%29>s,
 or MouseEvent
 <https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28tech._world._mouseevent%29>s
 are forwarded to the respective handlers; the world is not re-rendered."

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/15416: 2htdp/universe does not render final world after stop-when
Date: Mon, 10 Apr 2017 10:53:32 -0400

 This is indeed the desired semantics. If you really want to render the final state of the world, you need to supply a renderer for that world: 
 
 (require 2htdp/image)
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 
 ; World is Boolean
 (define (tick b) #true)
 (define (draw b)
   (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "white"))
 (define (draw-last b)
   (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "black"))
 
 (define (stop? b) b)
 
 (big-bang
   #false
   (on-tick tick)
   (on-draw draw)
   (stop-when stop? draw-last))
 
 This looks overkill here because we know that it is a black rectangle. But allowing rendering of the last value may trigger a bug in the renderer because it is not prepared to deal with final values. So I require the extra renderer. 
 
 ;; - - - 
 
 BTW, I consider it bad practice to put a big-bang expression by itself into the definitions window. I prefer to wrap it in a function. Please share w/ your students.

If the circle reaches size 0, is replaced with the message "You lose." and the game stops. The obvious way to implement this is 1) by using a Natural for the world, 2) with stop-when triggering when the world is 0, and 3) rendering the 0 world as tye "You lose." message. But because stop-when prevents the final world from rendering, the message never appears and it stops with a tiny circle instead.)
