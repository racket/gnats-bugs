>Description:
Using 2htdp/image if you 'freeze' a 'text' image and then 'flip-vertical' in interactions it works, but if you try doing that in a big-bang draw handler function it doesn't. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Type: (overlay (flip-vertical (freeze (text "hello" 24 "black")))
                                (empty-scene 300 200))
in the Interactions, it works.

Type: 
(big-bang ""
  (on-key (lambda (s kev) (string-append s kev)))
  (to-draw (lambda (s) (overlay (flip-vertical (freeze (text s 24 "black")))
                                (empty-scene 300 200)))))

in the interactions and it gives an error:
flip: cannot flip shapes that contain text
