>Description:
Was trying to open some .rkt source files from a DMG file mounted on Mac OS X, but it results in various errors,  and inability to even load the file contents into a buffer. The errors are things like:

make-directory: cannot make directory path: /Volumes/Racket Full v5.3.1.9/Racket Full v5.3.1.9/collects/eopl/private/compiled/drracket/ system error: Read-only file system; errno=30

 In the short term I think you can work around this by disabling the
 "populate 'compiled' directories" checkbox in the language dialog's
 show details section.
 
 You can probably also edit your preferences if you can't get that far ...
