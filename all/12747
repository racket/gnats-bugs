>Description:
Hi,

You may already be aware of this one, but just in case...
The inline check-syntax produces the following error:

module-path-index-resolve: "self" index has no resolution: #<module-path-index>

for this small program:
#lang racket
(define-syntax-rule (sthg)  (void))
(sthg)

Although executing the program gives no error.

 I think Matthew fixed this yesterday morning.  Can you try again with
 today's code?
 
 Thanks,

 I downloaded the nightly just an hour ago (it says "version
 5.3.0.4--2012-05-01(be49a59/a) [3m].").
 I may not have much time to go for rebuilding from source today, but I can
 try the nightly tomorrow if that's ok with you.

 Given the sha1 in that version, it looks like it doesn't have the fix
 yet.  Unfortunately, something seems to have gone wrong with the
 nightly builds today, but hopefully we'll have a working one for you
 tomorrow.

 Ack, nevermind. Pretty sure the problem was that I didn't re-build the C
 code.

 I still get this error in my DrRacket. I'm running from git with
 86a976531c7 as HEAD, which should include the fix from yesterday. This

 There was a random process that got stuck on the build from two nights
 ago, which blocked the one from last night to start.  I've killed the
 old job and ran a new one, so there is a a build that is ready now.
 (It was actually there much earlier...)
