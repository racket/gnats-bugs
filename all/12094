 Thanks. I don't know why you're not getting a stacktrace, but I have a
 hunch I know what the bug is.
 
 If you have the energy to try, can you please delete line 1534 from
 plt/collects/framework/private/text.rkt. The line in question looks
 like this:
 
      (set! todo '())
 
 You'll have to restart DrRacket after that change to see if that fixes
 the problem.

 That doesn't help, but i found out more information about the error:
 It only occurs, when the program contour is enabled. 
 If the program contour is hidden, everything is fine.
