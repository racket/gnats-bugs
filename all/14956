>Description:
When I tried to rebuild racket from the source code in Windows, I got this error:

-----
Uninstalling to prepare re-install of typed-racket-doc
delete-directory: cannot delete directory
  path: C:\Users\Nadie\Desktop\Dropbox\Hg\Racket\plt\racket\share\pkgs\.trash\14
22191136-0-r5rs-doc\r5rs\scribblings
  system error: Directory not empty; errno=41
-----

I don't know how to reproduce it. Probably it's because in the previous build I closed the cmd windows before the build was complete.

Nevertheless, the obvious workaround solves the problem. I just deleted the .trash folder and the following time the build completed without errors.
