>Description:
unfold-right works correctly unless the final, optional list argument is supplied.

The optional argument winds up being wrapped in an extra pair of parentheses.

'(3 2 (4 5))

Bigloo and Gambit give the expected result.

Bigloo:

1:=> (unfold-right null? car cdr '(2 3) '(4 5))
(3 2 4 5)

Gambit:

> (unfold-right null? car cdr '(2 3) '(4 5))
(3 2 4 5)

I suspect that your definition looks similar to this:

(define (unfold-right p f g seed . maybe-tail)
  (let lp ((seed seed) (ans maybe-tail))
    (if (p seed) ans
	(lp (g seed)
	    (cons (f seed) ans)))))

Changing the first line corrects the problem:

(define (unfold-right p f g seed [maybe-tail '()])
  (let lp ((seed seed) (ans maybe-tail))
    (if (p seed) ans
	(lp (g seed)
	    (cons (f seed) ans)))))


As I said, the function already works correctly when the optional argument is omitted:

> (unfold-right zero? (curryr expt 2) sub1 5)
'(1 4 9 16 25)
