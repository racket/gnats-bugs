>Description:
y'know how when you use the Ãœber-cool doc search, it displays the results in individual pages, rather than all at once?  For example, go to http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/html/search/index.html; type in "cons", and note the line that reads
        <<	Showing 1-20 (10 exact) of 113 matches	>>
Those chevrons, of course, are links to the previous and next pages full of results.
My suggestion is: add another pair of chevrons, linking to the same spots, at the _bottom_ of the page.  That way, when I've scrolled the page to view the results at the bottom, and want to go to the next or previous page, I don't have to scroll back up to find the chevrons -- I'll have a pair right there.
That is all :)
