>Description:
I accidently double-clicked on the up-arrow of the "Open Recent" files menu/pop-up-list of recently used files (i.e. two single clicks too close together in time). I was surprised that the DrRacket window was "restored" as if the title-bar (behind the up-arrow) had received the double-click instead.

It seems that the menu showing recently used files is not consuming all the mouse events it should. Double-clicking on a file in the menu correctly opens the file, but a double-click outside of the list of files is not handled and (incorrectly) passed onto the frame below the menu.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket, maximize to full-screen.
File->Open Recent. Note number of files shown must be more than can fit on the screen at one time so that the up/down scroll arrows appear.
Double-click on region around up-arrow.
Observe recent files menu disappears, and DrRacket window "restored" to non-maximized size.
