>Description:
I'm trying Racket 5.3.4 on Ubuntu 12.04.2 with xfce, chroot-ed on a Chromebook Pixel. The only browser is Chromium. `send-url` and things that depend on it don't work.

I'm a Linux GUI nub so I'm not sure what to teak. Anyway this PR is that it doesn't seem to work "out of box".
>How-To-Repeat:
Choose Help | Racket Documentation, or use `send-url` from net/sendurl in a program.

"send-url: Couldn't find a browser to open URL: <some-url>"

 It seems that on Ubuntu either "sensible-browser" or "xdg-open" would work.
 
 I notice that the latter is here but commented out:
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/collects/net/sendurl.rkt#L17-L36
 
 Is this intentional?

 Ah it looks like `xdg-open` was removed on purpose:

 However gnome-open is still in the list, just lower down.
 
 Perhaps instead of removing xdg-open from the list, perhaps it should
 be included, just lower down like gnome-open?
 
 Also, IIUC that it wouldn't hurt, perhaps "sensible-browser" should be
 added near or at the end of the list, as another chance to get it if
 nothing else found?
