>Description:
A student of mine submitted code that appears to use Unicode character \u2212 (the minus sign) instead of a dash.  Racket then appears to report that, e.g., bst-key is not defined.  It is actually bst<\u2212>key that is not defined, but my student was not able to diagnose the problem, and neither were my TAs.

I don't know how this came about, but I am submitted a change request that DrRacket be made aware that 'minus sign', 'en dash', and maybe also 'em dash' are all common ways to write ASCII 45 incorrectly.  In DrRacket's default font, these characters are barely distinguishable, and there needs to be a way to give a better error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. 
(define-struct bst (left key value right))

2. (define (every-key? bst p?)
  (cond [(false? bst) true]
        [(bst? bst)
         (cond 
           [(p? (bst−key bst)) 
            (and (every-key? (bst-left bst) p?) 
                 (every-key? (bst-right bst) p?))]
           [(not (p? (bst−key bst))) false])]))

3. Run

4. Resulting message: bst−key: this function is not defined

 We had lots of problems along these lines for non breaking space and dealt
 with it by special casing things when pasting.
 
 It would be useful to know if that would have helped here.

 Just to comment on this.  This has, on a first glance, the hallmarks of a
 copy-and-paste from a web page.  "\u2212" is a minus sign, but has one
 additional property: it's non-breaking so that, for example, web pages
 won't treat it as regular hyphenation that can be broken across lines.
  That is, you'd observe these characters in typographic contexts, such as
 on the web.
 
 It would be rare for someone to try to intentionally type it in a regular,
 programmer-friendly text editor.  I'd ask the student if they either were
 editing their original program in Microsoft Word or some word processor or
 on some editor that isn't programmer-friendly.

 Reported by Norman Ramsey for release: 5.3.6<br>
 <br>
 *** Description:<br>
 A student of mine submitted code that appears to use Unicode character \u22=

 <br>

 d maybe also &#39;em dash&#39; are all common ways to write ASCII 45 incorr=
 ectly. =C2=A0In DrRacket&#39;s default font, these characters are barely di=

 If that's what happened here, then it seems entirely reasonable to augment
 the pasting thing that's currently in DrRacket. If however, the student was
 on a mac and typed "alt-hyphen" into drracket and got that (different)
 character then it isn't really clear what's the right strategy.

 Reported by Norman Ramsey for release: 5.3.6<br>
 <br>
 *** Description:<br>
 A student of mine submitted code that appears to use Unicode character \u22=
 12 (the minus sign) instead of a dash. =C2=A0Racket then appears to report =
 that, e.g., bst-key is not defined. =C2=A0It is actually bst&lt;\u2212&gt;k=
 ey that is not defined, but my student was not able to diagnose the problem=
 , and neither were my TAs.<br>
 
 
 
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know how this came about, but I am submitted a change request t=
 hat DrRacket be made aware that &#39;minus sign&#39;, &#39;en dash&#39;, an=
 d maybe also &#39;em dash&#39; are all common ways to write ASCII 45 incorr=
 ectly. =C2=A0In DrRacket&#39;s default font, these characters are barely di=
 stinguishable, and there needs to be a way to give a better error message.<=

 Looking at the code a bit, I see that what DrRacket currently does is
 call string-normalize-nfkc which already turns non-breaking space into
 ordinary space, but doesn't turn the non-breaking minus sign into an
 ordinary hyphen.
 
 It also adds a special case for \u200b, tho, I see. So I'll just add
 another one for \u2212 and optimistically close the PR.
 
 If that seems insufficient, feel free to re-open (or just reply, of course).

 I will ask, but the student in question has shown little interest in
 helping others.

 I will ask, but I expect the answer to be no.
 
 A wise man once said that beginners make mistakes.  I would love to
 see DrRacket defend in depth against such mistakes.  That means not
 just translate-on-paste, but also do something about the error
 message.  A list of commonly confused Unicode characters would enable
 a more helpful error message, as would banning such characters from
 *SL identifiers.

 Yes, I was thinking similar thoughts: that this could be done via syntax
 errors at the *SL reader layer.
