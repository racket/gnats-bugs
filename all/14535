 I don't think this is a bug. I'm a bit surprised that it doesn't get
 printed twice at the racket repl, btu in general I don't think you can
 rely on that not printing twice (indeed, it prints 3 times with
 errortrace turned on).
 
 The specific reason it prints twice here is that drracket is looking
 for begins so it can splice their contents together.

 If you turn on errortrace, it will print three times.
 
 You can't get it to print more times from "inside" like that, I don't think.
 
 What I meant was that DrRacket first partially expands the expression
 to find the begins and then splices those begins all together into the
 top-level (begin at the top-level is defined to have this behavior and
 some tools that evaluate programs need to help to implement it,
 depending on what else they are doing).

 Ok I will close it then.
 
 I'm not sure I understand why splicing makes it print twice though.
 Can you give an example (that I can type in) that will make it print
 three times. For example, (begin-for-syntax (begin-for-syntax (display
 "a"))) still only prints twice.
