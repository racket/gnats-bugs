>Description:
Dear Racket developers,

First of all, thanks for Racket. I really really love Racket and DrRacket.

I am an emacs user and am trying to learn writing my own keybindings.

The bug I am reporting is very minor. If I add a key binding and it takes effect immediately. But when I remove a key binding, it does not take into effect immediately.

Thanks
Ramakrishnan
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file /tmp/keybindings.rkt with the following content

;; start
#lang s-exp framework/keybinding-lang

(keybinding "c:a" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "!")))
;; end

Now, navigate to Edit->keybindings->Add user defined keybindings

and select /tmp/keybindings.rkt

Now, verify that C-a inserts a "!". 

Now navigate to Edit->keybindings->Remove "/tmp/keybindings.rkt"

Now, doing C-a still inserts a "!"

I am running Racket from git with the HEAD - 8483b8eea55444f82c08c6348449e42e9346871e

 I just noticed the text:
 
 "Note that DrRacket does not reload keybindings files automatically
 when you make changes, so you’ll need to restart DrRacket to see
 changes to the file."
 
 So, perhaps this explains it and it is a known behaviour. Sorry for
 the noise. :-(

 A known behavior yes, desireable no. It is something we've talked
 about trying to fix so I hope we'll get to it someday.
 
 Thanks for the report.
