>Description:
Repeatedly running the program in reproduction steps eventually crashes DrRacket. Usually it takes one or two tries.

The following message is printed in the terminal:

The program 'drracket' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 21213 error_code 9 request_code 152 minor_code 4)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


I've gotten this error from running the same program in command-line Racket as well.

Using a canvas backed by OpenGL doesn't seem to cause this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:

(for ([_  (in-range 7)])
  (define bm (make-gl-bitmap 400 400 (new gl-config%)))

 I haven't been able to replicate this on a VirtualBox VM running Linux.
 I think it probably depends on the OpenGL driver, and I'll be able to
 try different machines in a few weeks.

 I can try tracking it down, if it's feasible to tell me how.
 
 Alternatively, I can set up an SSH server and see if I can reproduce it 
 over an SSH session.
