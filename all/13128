>Description:
In the course of pruning down PR13127, I discovered a probably-unrelated bug, where use of (wrapper2?) makes it impossible to use wrapper2-contents with the same types as PR13127. Also, the printing of the error is terribly strange-looking. See Steps to Reproduce for a short program demonstrating the problem.

Here is the output from TR:

pruned2.rkt:30:6: Type Checker: Polymorphic function wrapper2-contents could not be applied to arguments:
Argument 1:
  Expected: (wrapper2 State)
  Given:    #(struct:#<syntax:/Users/tonyg/src/racket-typed-matrix/pruned2.rkt:10:9 wrapper2> ((foo Any)))

Result type:     ((foo State) : ((! False @ (((wrapper2 State) 0)) 0) | (False @ (((wrapper2 State) 0)) 0)) : (((wrapper2 State) 0) 0))
Expected result: (foo State)

  in: (wrapper2-contents w)
  context...:
   /usr/local/Racket/collects/typed-racket/typecheck/tc-toplevel.rkt:272:0: type-check
   success
   /usr/local/Racket/collects/typed-racket/typed-racket.rkt:38:4

>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket/base

(require racket/match)

(struct: (State)
	 foo ([fn : (State -> State)])) ;; The arrow seems necessary!
					;; [fn : State] typechecks.

(struct: (State)
	 wrapper2 ([contents : (foo State)]))

;;---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(: something : (All (State) (wrapper2 State) -> (foo State)))

;; Works.
#;(define (something w)
  (wrapper2-contents w))

;; Works.
#;(define (something w)
  (if (even? 24)
      (wrapper2-contents w)
      (error 'something "Oh no")))

;; Doesn't work and looks VERY strange.
;; The printing is weird, and the mismatch is just bizarre.
(define (something w)
  (if (wrapper2? w)
      (wrapper2-contents w)
      (error 'something "Oh no")))
