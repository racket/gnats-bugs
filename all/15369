 My sincere apologies. This is a long-known bug, #11120. I’ve never thought hard about how to fix it. Ugh.

 No worries Live demos can fail. It looked familiar and I may even have submitted the old bug report. But having it and the check-syntax thing fail on me simultaneously may have uncovered an idea on how to go about it. Essentially some renaming info is missing from the locally defined struct and both the stepper and check-syntax suffer from this (in different ways).

 I remember when this feature (local structs) was added in 2010, and thinking “oh boy, that’s not going to work in the stepper at all.” There’s a bunch of extra software required to associate ids with structure types. It’s not hard, but it’s not going to happen right away.
