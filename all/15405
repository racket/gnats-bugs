In DrRacket 6.8 running under GNOME 3.20 and Wayland, the pop-up tooltips take the focus away from DrRacket. This causes them to disappear, so focus returns to DrRacket. Because the mouse is in the same place, the tooltip reappears, but then takes the focus, causing its own disappearance. This goes on until the mouse is moved off the identifier.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrRacket 6.8 under Wayland
2. In a new file, write

#lang racket
+

3. Mouse over +. The tooltip appearance/disappearance cycle begins.

 The cycle is kind of expected. What is not expected is that the window
 would appear under the mouse (instead of off to the right). Is it possible
 to get a screenshot of the window when it appears to help me see what is
 going on ?

 Hi Robby,
 
 I recorded a video: https://youtu.be/a0Ogy_38xd0
 
 Sorry for the shaky quality of my phone camera, I haven't yet figured 
 out how to undermine Wayland's security features to take screen 
 recordings yet.
 
 Thanks!

 Oh, I see what you mean now. I think that this commit message
 basically covers the current state.

 Wayland

 Yeah, I don't expect it to work 100%. But I figured that reporting
 strange issues was better than not doing so.
 
 It's very nice having Wayland support, even if it's incomplete. I have a
 very high DPI laptop screen, and a large but low-DPI external monitor.
 Wayland actually changes the DPI of windows when I drag them from my
 laptop screen to the external one, so it's great to be able to use at my
 home desk.
 
 If deadlines weren't looming, I'd look at taking a crack at this myself.
 Perhaps in a few weeks.
 
 Thanks for the quick response, as usual!

 >>>     *** Description:
 >>>     In DrRacket 6.8 running under GNOME 3.20 and Wayland, the pop-up
 >>>     tooltips take the focus away from DrRacket. This causes them to
 >>>     disappear, so focus returns to DrRacket. Because the mouse is in the
 >>>     same place, the tooltip reappears, but then takes the focus, causing
 >>>     its own disappearance. This goes on until the mouse is moved off the
 >>>     identifier.
 >>>
 >>>     *** How to repeat:
 >>>     1. Open DrRacket 6.8 under Wayland
 >>>     2. In a new file, write
 >>>
 >>>     #lang racket
 >>>     +
 >>>
 >>>     3. Mouse over +. The tooltip appearance/disappearance cycle begins.
