>Description:
In DrRacket, the multi-file search results dialog isn't completely painted until after the search is completed. In particular, the "stop search" button is not displayed until after the search is completed and too late to actually stop the search. Perhaps some threading issue on Windows?
>How-To-Repeat:
Perform some "Search in files" (multi-file search) for something in a large part of the file-system, e.g. 'collects', such the search will take quite some time to complete.
Observe search results dialog is partially painted, search hits start to appear, and "stop search" button is not present.
