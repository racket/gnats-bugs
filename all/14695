I run the 32bit version of DrRacket on Windows 7 64bit. I use the 32-bit version because I have to compile for 32 bit versions of Windows. DrRacket IDE regularly becomes unresponsive when opening a racket file - especially if I try to resize or move the window before it finishes whatever processes it doing in the background.

 Can you say more about your machine, please? How many cores does it
 have and what kind of processor is it? Also, are you using the "Use
 the language declared in the source" setting?

I don't have any problem on Linux so I have been debugging on there then rebooting into windows to compile and unzip to our application server.

 Is there a (hopefully small) example file that you can provide with
 this bad behavior? That would help me figure out what's going on, I
 think.

 Well, I tried this under windows 7 with a 32 bit build but I'm not
 seeing any untoward behavior.

 Another possibility that comes to mind is that you machine is infected
 with a virus or some other malware that is causing things to behave
 strangely.
 
 Are you experiencing bad behavior with other apps, or only with drracket?

 Well, maybe this will help us figured it out:
 
 - do versions before 6.1 still not freeze?
 
 - can you start up drracket from the command line? Specifically, if
 you open a command.com window and then cd to the directory where
 Racket is installed, and then run this command:
 
    racket.exe -l- drracket
 
 then you should see drracket appear. Open a file, move the window,
 etc, to get it frozen. Then, go back to the terminal window and type
 control-c. If we are lucky, this will produce a stacktrace that will
 give us a clue what's going on.
 
 Thanks for your patience,
 Robby

 Oh! That's a good clue, actually! Is there a networked filesystem
 involved somehow, by chance?

 Hard to say. But I'm slightly more optimistic that there's something
 special about your machine that corresponds to a bug that might be
 revealed with the control-c trick.

I create shortcuts on the client's desktop to the .exe file on the server for new programs. When doing maintenance, I don't even visit the clients' machines at all. Could it be the ramdisk?

 Ah. This may be a bug in the db library, possibly, then.
 
 I've cc'd Ryan Culpepper, the author of that library.
