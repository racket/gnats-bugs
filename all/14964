>Description:
Example:

  #lang racket

  (struct foo (x) #:prefab #:mutable)
  (foo 1)

  (prefab-key? '(foo #(0)))

Running this prints:

'#s((foo #(0)) 1)
#f

Which is odd, since '(foo #(0)) is used in printing but the predicate
reports that it's not a valid key.

The supposedly invalid key is also accepted/produced by other functions:

> (make-prefab-struct '(foo #(0)) 5)
'#s((foo #(0)) 5)
> (prefab-struct-key (foo "1"))
'(foo #(0))

It looks like this behavior changed since v6.1.1.

  | fix `prefab-key?` for inferred field count
  | 
  | Instead of inferring a field count of 0, accept a key that
  | works with some number of fields.
