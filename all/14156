>Description:
From the BSL random docs:

(random x) â†’ integer
  x : integer
Generates a random natural number less than some given exact integer.

Sounds like it should take a natural right?  In fact, if you give it a negative integer you get an unhappy error

(btw, the help desk is AMAZING!)
>How-To-Repeat:
> (random -5)
random: expects (or/c (integer-in 1 4294967087) pseudo-random-generator?) or a pseudo-random-generator, given -5
