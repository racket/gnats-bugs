>Description:
When I use convert from file/convertible to convert an image created with 2htdp/image to png bytes, the resulting image is one pixel larger in each dimension than the original.  The last pixel is transparent, and the second to last pixel is partially transparent.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require 2htdp/image)
(require file/convertible)

(define size 15)

;saving using save-image
(save-image (square size "solid" "red") "test1.png")

;saving using convert
(call-with-output-file "test2.png"
  (lambda (p)
    (display (convert (square size "solid" "red") 'png-bytes) p))
   #:exists 'replace)

;saving using convert after cropping
(call-with-output-file "test3.png"
  (lambda (p)
    (display (convert (crop 0 0 15 15 (square size "solid" "red")) 'png-bytes) p))
   #:exists 'replace)

;note that test1.png is 15x15, with fully opaque pixels
;test2.png and test3.png are both 16x16, and the last two pixels are not opaque
