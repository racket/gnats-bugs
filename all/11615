>Description:
It appears that stipples only work when the pen is black. In the code below if you change the "black" to "blue", then the stippling doesn't happen.

Also, the docs say that white regions of the stipple just don't draw, but they seem to actually draw in white.

 The problem actually seems to be `erase' on a monochrome bitmap. If you
 take the `erase' call out, it works as expected. (Unlike gr1, bitmaps
 are always initialized sensibly in gr2.)

 Bizarre that the right results correlated with creating a different pen!
