It is not possible to open .rkt files by clicking on an icon in the finder. When clicked on the file, DrRacket opens but only with an empty window. Please correct this bug.

Thanks and Greets,

 This is a duplicate of PR's 11841 and 12105, and possibly related to PR 9310.

 Actually, it DOES work if DrRacket is already running.  (I haven't tried this on 10.7 yet, but it works in 10.4 through 10.6.)  So here's an immediate work-around: after you've double-clicked the file and opened an empty window, double-click the same file again and it'll open correctly.
