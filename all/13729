>Description:
print-cookie from net/cookie generates incorrect paths in Set-Cookie.  

The latest RFC on cookies state that the value for Path in Set-Cookie can include any character except ; and control characters.  (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265).  RFC 6265 also states that non empty paths MUST start with / or else they will be ignored.

So something like

(define c (set-cookie "foo" "bar"))
(cookie:add-path c "/")
(printf "~a" (print-cookie c))

should display:
foo=bar; Path=/;

instead of:
foo=bar; Path="/"; Version=1

It doesn't seem that current browsers (Firefox 20) accept anything but RFC 6265 cookies.  At any rate, Firefox currently ignores what net/cookie generates for paths (as they don't start with / - they start with ") and substitutes the default.





>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require net/cookie)
(define c (set-cookie "foo" "bar"))
(cookie:add-path c "/")
(printf "~a" (print-cookie c))
