My guess is that this is some container thing for the real packages,
but in that case there's no real point in having authors and version
in the info, or in having a LICENSE file.

 This is intentionally the case for lots of packages in the new setup, such
 as "web-server", "plot", "string-constants", and many others. These are
 packages that exist to be installed and depended on, with dependencies on
 the real implementation. Note that it's a pkg, but not a collection (the
 actual typed-racket collection is in the typed-racket-lib pkg).

 So this was my guess -- and there is definitely weirdness then.  (And it
 obviously is not a TR issue but a superset.)  The actuall stuff that is
 in the package was written by Matthew -- shouldn't he be the author?
 What about the version -- is it the maximum of the packages that it
 depends on?  But even worse -- why is there a license there, and what
 code does it cover?
 
 And yes, these are all exaggerations, but they all have practical
 implications that were explicit goals in having a package system:
 
   * Author: in the TR case, you're the main developer so you should be
     the author.  If I write some single random TR library that you
     decide to include that doesn't mean that I should be listed as an
     author in the meta package.
 
     Alternatively, if I create my own meta-package, choosing bits and
     pieces of TR, then I should not be using your name, since I'm in
     charge of the resulting mess.  But I'm obviously not an author --
     I'm just a packager.
 
   * Version: it seems that the version will always be some combination
     (not maximum, of course) of the versions of the dependant packages
     -- and if that's the case, then it doesn't make much sense to have a
     version there in the first place.  IOW, the version is more like a
     list of versions of the dependencies, which is better inferred than
     specified.
 
   * License: it's true that things are convenient now since the same
     license applies to all code, but what happens when that's no longer
     true?  Again, it seems to me that it's better to make an automatic
     composition of licenses in some way instead of waiting for a
     disaster of someone pissed at the fact that their contributed code
     is distributed under a different license.
 
     (The contents is slightly bogus too: how can the license in the *TR*
     meta package say that I'm allowed to link *Racket*?)
 
     (An easy way out here: have some generic license saying that this
     package packs several other packages, and the licese is specified in
     the respective directories.)
 
 (BTW, "weirdness" is a bad choice here -- I'd definitely consider this
 as a proper bug.  The goal is to open things up and this is a real
 problem on the way there.)

 I think you are misunderstanding what's going on here. This is a
 package with a very small amount of code, created for the purpose of
 conveniently referring to multiple other packages. It doesn't contain
 or own its dependent packages, and it's authorship and license are
 just for the very small package itself.
 
 The fact that Matthew created the files isn't relevant here, except as
 a fact about how we work together as a group.
 
 As for the versioning, I think in all of the cases in the current
 tree, the components are developed together and thus sharing a version
 makes the most sense. If someone creates a new meta-package, then they
 should version it as they see fit.

 TL;DR: Looks like this boils down to two problems: license files
 (suggested revisions below), and version on a meta-package that should
 probably be dropped (this is a TR-only issue, as described below).

 I think that I do understand it now: what I'm saying is that having a
 license for this code is somewhere between weird and a bug, IMO more
 towards the latter.  The "small amount of code", is not really code, but
 a description of the package -- and since it refers to the package that
 it appears in (ie, the "author" field in a package refers to whoever
 wrote the code in that same package), then (a) it's erroneous and (b) it
 doesn't even include the whole info file, just the dependencies.
 
 And yes, this is in other similar metapackages: there is the xrepl one
 that defines me as an author though I didn't write any of the rest of
 the code in that package which is basically just the dependencies.
 Sure, I understand what it's *supposed* to say, but that doesn't mean
 that it's less broken.  To say this differently, I completely agree with
 you here:

 > and license are just for the very small package itself.
 
 and the result of that is that having me as an author there is wrong.
 (Plus, I'm saying that the "small code" is very small: 0 lines.)
 
 Also note that I asked to re-open this *and* suggested a solution to the
 license issue, one that wouldn't even be hard to implement.  Revise the
 lisence files in two ways:
 
 1. License files in meta-packages should just say that each of the
    packages they depend on has its own license.  There's no need for
    anything else since there is no other *code*.  (As I said above, the
    info file definitions are not code.)
 
 2. As a side note, I pointed at the fact that the licenses should make
    any claims about Racket.
 
 3. And something that can be added here: this will also make it possible
    to change the documentation license, a point that was raised several
    times in the past (and I think that there was some note that LGPL can
    be used for documentation but it wasn't really proper in some way).
 
 As a specific example: the license file in pkgs/xrepl/LICENSE.txt will
 change as in (1) and say that you should see the licenses in the
 referred packages; and the license in pkgs/xrepl-lib/LICENSE.txt should
 be rephrased as in (2), removing the "This means that you can link
 Racket into" sentence which is inappropriate there.  (Reminder: I'm
 talking from a point of view of where packages should take the whole
 thing: when things are properly distributed, the xrepl library would no
 longer be a required part of Racket, and therefore should not talk about
 what you can or cannot do with Racket.)  The last file is
 pkgs/xrepl-doc/LICENSE.txt which (in addition to (2)) could be changed
 to use one of the documentation-friendly licenses.

 Yes -- and *that's* why this is fine now.  But when it is truly
 distributed, this will move from the weirdness/semi-bug category to a
 real bug.  Other people will contribute code, and they will distribute
 their own packages or create packages that gather a different set of
 basic packages (all goals of the system).  When that happens, they will
 look at the "standard" set of packages, and will be somewhere between
 thoroughly confused to downright pissed at the fact that it's bogus
 information.  And this answer of "how we work as a group" will be
 obviously irrelevant then, since the goal is to distribute things, so
 there's no preference or different reading of files based on who wrote
 them.
 
 (BTW, take Emacs as a similar example: it went through the stage of
 making people sign papers (real ones) for their code to be included,
 essentially making them part of the group.  That's no longer done when
 you can easily write your code and distribute it as a package.)

 Again, this makes kind of sense for a monolithic distribution, and will
 completely fail in any of the above scenarios of the package system's
 goals: when someone creates their own package that will be included in
 other packages, or when someone creates their own meta-package as a
 collection of packages that they want to distribute.  I can't even find
 some sensible meaning for such a version.  What happens when one of
 foo-lib's version and foo's version bumped and the other didn't?
 
 But ... this *does* like a TR issue.  A quick (and not too precise[*])
 grep over the packages shows that the typed-racket package is the only
 meta-package with a version specified.  All other versions are in real
 packages.  So I think that it should just be removed.  Looks like
 Stephen added it in 2dc59f7d, but the commit message doesn't explain
 much so I'm guessing that this was just overlooking it.
 
 ([*] I grepped for `version' in all files that look like
 "pkgs/(.*)-pkgs/\1/info.rkt", and there are only two mentions, one in TR
 and one in DR (but there "drracket" is a proper package with its own
 code).)
