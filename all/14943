=> cube: expected a function call, but there is no open parenthesis before this function in: cube

No error if defs.rkt uses #lang racket. Same problem in git head.

 I don't think there's any reasonable way to make this work. IIRC, a BSL 
 "function" is really a macro that cannot be used as a variable reference 
 (by design). The only way to make this work would be for BSL to publish 
 its compile-time representation of "functions" and for rackunit to know 
 about them. That is, rackunit would depend on htdp-lib. Or they would 
 both have to depend on something new that defined this compile-time 
 interface.
