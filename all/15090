>Description:
From the docs:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/foreign_cvector.html?q=c-vector#%28def._%28%28lib._ffi%2Funsafe%2Fcvector..rkt%29._cvector%29%29
(_cvector mode type maybe-len)
_cvector

Like _bytes, _cvector can be used as a simple type that corresponds to a pointer that is managed as a safe C vector on the Racket side. The longer form behaves similarly to the _list and _vector custom types, except that _cvector is more efficient; no Racket list or vector is needed.

Yet _cvector doesn't support (_cvector i _type).

(provide _cvector)
(define-fun-syntax _cvector
  (syntax-id-rules (i o io)
    [(_ i     ) _cvector*]
    [(_ o  t n) (type: _pointer ; needs to be a pointer, not a cvector*
                 pre:  (malloc n t)
                 post: (x => (make-cvector x t n)))]
    [(_ io    ) (type: _cvector*
                 bind: tmp
                 pre:  (x => (cvector-ptr x))
                 post: (x => tmp))]
    [(_ . xs)   (_cvector* . xs)]
    [_          _cvector*]))
