>Description:
It seems like DrRacket continues to run a program that uses places even after the stop button is pressed.

I'm not sure if this is a bug, or just a usability bug. But either way, it seems like there should be a way (in the GUI, either the stop button directly or a button right next to it) to stop all of the running places.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. In a new file, create the following program:

#lang racket

(list
 (thread
  (lambda ()
    (future (lambda ()
              (let loop () (loop))))))
 (thread
  (lambda ()
    (future (lambda ()
              (let loop () (loop))))))
 (thread
  (lambda ()
    (future (lambda ()
              (let loop () (loop))))))
 (thread
  (lambda ()
    (future (lambda ()
              (let loop () (loop)))))))

(let loop () (loop))

2. Hit run
2a. Notice in `top -o cpu` that DrRacket is now taking about 500% CPU.

3. Click stop.
3a. Not again in top that DrRacket is now at 400% cpu. I suspect this is because the main thread has stopped, but the other ones have not.

 Also, for whatever it's worth. When I close the tab, all of the
 running threads associated with that tab get killed. But I certainly
 should be able to do that without having to close and reopen the tab
 every time.

 The stop button is defined as "if I haven't been clicked recently,
 send the main thread a break. If I have, ask the user if they want me
 to shutdown the current custodian".
 
 So I think what you're seeing is the behavior that was intended.
 Perhaps you want to be doing <menukey>-k instead of clicking the stop
 button.

 Ah, okay. Thank you. It still might make sense to have a button to
 force kill the program, but that might just make things more
 cluttered, and <meta>-k seems to work.
 
 Again, thank you.

 I had a look at the docs and they're somewhat vague, but provide some
 hints. I don't suppose you'd be interested in suggesting an edit?

 Do you mean in the docs or in the GUI (or both)?
 
 Either way sure.
 
 I'm kind of thinking that a possible solution is after the stop button
 is pressed, it turns into a "Force Stop" button. But I don't know if
 the DrRacket toolbar supports changing button labels like that, or if
 that would break other things.

 I've made this change, except I went with "kill" instead of "force
 stop" as the label.
 
 I did that because I didn't actually come back and read this message
 carefully before making the change, ack. I kind of like the shorter
 name better, but if the longer one is preferred, then I can change it.
