>Description:
Hi,

Maybe you want to double check the following two
statementats in The Racket Guide 6.4:

1. At the end of description of only-in:

..., and bind-id is the name that will be bound
in the importing context instead of bind-id.

I think it should be "... instead of orig-id."

2. At the begin of description of except-in:

This form is the complement of only: ...

I think it should be "... of only-in:".

Best regards,
lee
