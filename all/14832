>Description:
`contract-random-generate` does not generate any value for contracts of the form (and/c ...) even when the sub-contracts are simple.
>How-To-Repeat:
(contact-random-generate (and/c any/c))
; contract-random-generate: unable to construct any generator for contract: #<flat-contract: (and/c any/c)>
; Context:
;  /tmp/test.rkt:1:1 [running body]

As a consequence, the following program gets away with `contract-exercise`:

(define/contract (f x)
  ((and/c (listof any/c) pair?) . -> . none/c)
  (pair? x))
(contract-exercise f)
; (ok)


The following program fails easily. Even though the pre-condition is weaker, the generated input is almost always a non-empty list:

(define/contract (f x)
  ((listof any/c) . -> . none/c)
  (pair? x))
(contract-exercise f)
; f: broke its contract

  | generalize the random contract generation APIs to allow
  | a more dynamic notion of failure
  | 
  | use that to try harder with and/c contracts. In particular,
  | the contract system now tries to generate the arguments
  | on their own and then uses the other arguments to filter
  | (when they are all flat contracts, of course)
  | 
  | closes PR 14832
