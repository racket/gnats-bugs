>Description:
long lists displayed as a column of single elements can make their review as if not more cumbersome than just successively wrapping their display within the bound of widow's width.

- It would be nice to optionally inhibit this feature.
- Or possibly more ideally limiting the number of elements displayed per line to a user defined parameter number of elements, or as many as fit the window's width.

>How-To-Repeat:
evaluate an expression of a list of elements, whose display exceeds the width of the window, and the list will be displayed one element per line; so lists that may contain 100's of elements consumes substantially more real estate than practically needed.

i.e.
> (define x '(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z))
> x
(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z)
> x {in a narrow window, which is often as cumbersome as too may in a single line}

 Further, it may be further nice to be able to specify the maximum number of lines or elements to literally display prior to terminating the list with a ... indicating there were additional elements not displayed,
 
 This way reasonably long lists may be displayed without contaminating the interaction window with indefinitely long lists, per user defined preferences.

 Please lower the priority, as I was able to eliminate the printing of a single element per line for large lists by changing the “Choose Language...” configuration.
