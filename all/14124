>Description:
I found a very annoying bug soon after installing the latest version of Racket. First of all there was no language chosen so i had to choose a language according to my needs. I opened the language menu and changed it to Beginning Student. Here comes the bug it selects the racket language even after selecting Beginning Student. I kept changing it and it kept going back to the same condition. After several tries i gave up and  installed an older version and now it all works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.to choose a language go to the language menu
2.select the language beginning student
3.check the language menu again

 I'm not able to make this happen, but I do see some bad behavior in the
 language dialog in 5.3.6 that doesn't happen in the latest version in git
 head, so I wonder if maybe you're seeing that same bad behavior, perhaps in
 a worse way for you.
 
 If you download a snapshot build:
 
   http://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/snapshots/
   http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/
 
 (don't download the minimal version; it doesn't have drracket) and then
 move your preferences file away and start it up, do you see the same bad
 behavior?

 Thanks for installing it.
 
 It is as stable as our nightly/snapshot builds tend to be. We have lots of
 automated testing that runs on every change to the source and there are not
 many tests failing in that (the ones I know are actually bugs in the
 tests), but we do more by-hand testing for actual releases. And the next
 release actually has some pretty major changes in it, so there may still be
 bugs lurking in there.
 
 In short, it is hard to predict, but you are probably fine to use it until
 you run into a problem.
