>Description:
Example:

-> (make-prefab-struct '(foo 5 (1 #f) #(1) bar 2 #(99999)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
'#s((foo (1 #f) #(1) bar 2 #(0 1)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

The #(99999) in the prefab struct key refers to an index that is greater than
the number of fields in the prefab. Instead of erroring (which the documentation
implies), it makes every field mutable instead.
