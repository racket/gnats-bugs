>Description:
The method client->screen in list-box% does not take into account the size of the label of the list-box%.

The program below demonstrates the issue. Click on the first 'n' in banana in both list boxes. My results are:
mouse-down: (18,23) (179,354)
mouse-down: (17,23) (178,486)

The local (client) coordinates of the click should be roughly the same (and they are).

But the global (screen) coordinates should be quite different in both x and y. Notice that the x is roughly the same, even though the menu of items is shifted to the right by the label of the list-box.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require racket/gui)

(define my-list-box%
  (class list-box%
    (super-new)
    
    (inherit client->screen)
    (define/override (on-subwindow-event r e)
      (case (send e get-event-type)
        [(left-down)
         (let*-values ([(lx) (send e get-x)]
                       [(ly) (send e get-y)]
                       [(gx gy) (client->screen lx ly)])
           (printf "mouse-down: (~a,~a) (~a,~a)~n" lx ly gx gy))]
        [else
         (void)]
        )
      #f
      )
    
    ))

(define f 
  (new frame%
     [label "test list box client->screen"]
     [width 400]
     [height 300]
     ))

(define l1
  (new my-list-box%
    [parent f]
    [label #f]
    [choices (list "apple" "banana" "cherry")]
    ))

(define l2
  (new my-list-box%
    [parent f]
    [label "list-box of fruit"]
    [choices (list "apple" "banana" "cherry")]
    ))

(send f show #t)
