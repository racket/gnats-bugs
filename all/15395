When I hit C-M-d, a single char is deleted (as though I'd hit C-d).

It doesn't appear to be a problem with my Alt/Meta key, as other C-M- combinations work normally: e.g., C-M-f, C-M-b, C-M-SPC, C-M-u, etc... Also, C-M- keys work normally in GNU Emacs.

 When you select the menu item "Edit | Keybindings | Show Active
 Keybindings", what is the name of the bindigng you see associated with
 C-M-d? (In racket/gui's keybindings lingo, C-M-d is not spelled
 "C-M-d" but if you poke around in the dialog you'll see quickly
 enough. Generally the convention is to use colons to separate
 modifiers. More details here:

 Robby,
 There's no mapping for `c:m:d', but there is one for down-sexp:
 
 down-sexp (~c:m:down)
 
 What does the ~ mean here?
 
 Thanks,
 Brett S.

 Ah. I see now (Section 3.3 Keyboard Shortcuts) that ~c:m is "Alt
 Meta".  I've verified that hitting `C-[ Alt-down` (or `esc Alt-down`)
 executes down-sexp.
 
 Given that most users probably don't have separate Alt and Meta keys,
 this seems like a strange default. Are there predefined keybindings
 that could be downloaded from PlaneT, which provide a significant
 subset of the standard paredit functionality on the standard paredit
 keys?
 
 Thanks,
 Brett S.
