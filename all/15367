>Description:
The 'Racket v6.7.0.1' directory created by installing current dmg image on Mac results in icons with "NOT" style crosses indicating that there is an incompatibility with the executable and the system. Indeed, upon clicking the icon, the response dialog box shows

------
You can’t use this version of the application “DrRacket” with this version of OS X.

You have OS X 10.11.6. The application requires OS X 10.12 or later.
------

Directly running the executable in the ./bin subdirectory works perfectly.

I'm sure that it's part of Apple's plan to direct everybody to the next operating system.

 Hi John --- Did you get the snapshot from the Northwestern site or the
 Utah site?
 
 Robby --- if the answer is Northwestern then I think the solution is to
 configure the build with `--enable-sdk6=...`.

 The Northwestern site's builds have just completed a first build with
 that flag. So the download may work properly now.
