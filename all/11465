>Description:
From http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html:

"An editor is not tied to any particular thread or eventspace, except to the degree that it is displayed in a canvas (which has an eventspace). Concurrent access of an editor is always safe, in the sense that the editor will not become corrupted. However, because editor access can trigger locks, and because lock-rejected operations tend to fail silently, concurrent access can produce unexpected results."

Having written an application that necessarily accesses an editor<%> concurrently, I have discovered that lock-rejected operations do not fail silently. They throw exceptions of type "sequence-contract-violation" or something like that.
