 Is DrRacket raising this? Sadly, the stacktrace looks like the parts that
 are common to all GUI callbacks, so it doesn't seem to be much help.

 Is it possible you're calling GUI methods on threads other than the
 eventspace main thread of the enclosing frame%/dialog%?

 Ah, ok, I can reproduce the error reliably now: here's the test program:
 
     https://gist.github.com/2596189
 
 Run the program, and press the Build button.  What you should see is
 an erroneous text% where the characters fit just a single column, with
 the exception printing to standard error.
 
 It appears that the content being written has to be longer than the
 width of the editor in order to invoke the error.
 
 
 This is on Racket 5.2.1 on a Linux box, running XMonad.  I have not
 tested this against another machine to see if the behavior is platform
 or window-manager specific.

 At first glance, this seems to be a bug in open-input-text-editor, but
 I'm not positive.

 Ok; it does appear to have some connection to threads, since when I don't
 spawn them in the example, the bug doesn't manifest.  Can you confirm that
 you see the problem on your machine too?

 I'm not sure what the invariant that open-input-text-editor produced
 ports should have (the docs seem silent on this point) so to me it
 looks like a bug in open-input-text-editor but it could be that you're
 not allowed to use the port like that.
 
 The implementation of open-input-text-editor is, I believe, in Racket. :)

 Yes, I had been staring at snipfile.rkt to figure out what in the text
 output port implementation is causing this, but nothing strikes me as weird
 yet.  I assume that all the methods from the text% are parameterized over
 the appropriate eventspace.  Haven't figured out yet where my mental model
 is deviating from reality yet.

 The code that would be doing something with threads (ie ensuring that
 all mutation is happening on a reasonable thread to avoid
 race-conditions) should all be in that file. So if you don't see it
 moving stuff around between threads, then probably that's just
 completely missing.
 
 There may be a reason for that tho....? Maybe?

 No, `text%' methods do not try to do anything with eventspaces. See
 
 http://doc.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html?q=editors%20and%20threads#(part._editorthreads)
 
 for more information.
 
 
 I'll soon push a change to `open-output-text-editor' that causes the port
 to use the creation-time eventspace to push content to the editor (when
 used in a thread other than the eventspace's handler thread). This is
 backward-incompatible, but I think unlikely to break existing programs.
 There's a new `#:eventspace' argument to give callers control.
 
 There were also problems with the synchronization that text editors are
 supposed to provide, and I'll pushed improvements on that front. Unless
 you disable mouse and key events for the editor canvas in your example
 program, however, those improvements don't solve the problem (i.e., the
 intended guarantees are too weak).

 If the eventspace captured in the port and the eventspace of the frame
 are the same eventspace, why is it required to disable mouse and key
 events to make the port work?

 My message got a little mangled through various edits. The above

 which now happens only if `#:eventspace #f' is used to disable
