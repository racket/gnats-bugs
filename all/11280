>Description:
On http://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/, Section 3 there is a data definition for a blog struct. The code and then the reference use different names (define-struct vs. struct), and add keywords. I think this could be cleaned up by switching everything over to using struct.

Section in question below.

We start by considering our data definitions. We want to represent a list of posts. Letâ€™s say that a post is:

  (define-struct post (title body))

(struct	 	post (title body)
 	 	#:extra-constructor-name make-post)
  title : string?
  body : string?
