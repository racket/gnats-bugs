>Description:
Start with an empty buffer, and make it have this at the top

  #lang at-exp racket

Now insert a space before the `#lang', then insert "t" at the end
and see the "#lang at-exp" turn red.  Now delete the "t", and the
red highlight stays.

The same happens with:

  ;
  #lang at-exp racket

with no spaces.

It does not happen without the `at-exp' language.

*But*, with a `#lang s-exp' prefix there are no red highlights when
the language is wrong.  (The online checker does give an indication
that it is wrong or right, but no color changes.)
