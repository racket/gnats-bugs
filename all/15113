 What do you mean by 'broken'?  The on-draw clauses remain valid for backwards compatibility. Could you send a program that breaks in some way so I can see what you mean? Thanks. -- Matthias

 I did fix this and I confirmed it in 6.2 while off the 'net. 
 I am pretty sure it was also fixed for 6.1 and possibly 6,0, 
 because you helped me fix some of it in CO last August. 
 
 I'll close the report. 
 
 EMU: can you ask people to download the new version of DrRacket? 
 
 Thanks -- Matthias
