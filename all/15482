>Description:
I had split my DrRacket window into two parts.  I went to collapse it back to one, but the "collapse" menu-item was greyed out.  I tried splitting into three, but it remained grayed out.  When I switched tabs, a DrRacket-error-message popped up (msg is below).  I was in beginning-student at the time, and hadn't been doing anything unusual previous to that.  (I'd been using the stepper 40min before.)  MacOS.

(So not much to go on, and low priority, so I'm not expecting this to get looked in to.  Just figured if other people have had the same problem, this report might add info to others' reports.)
