The default location of a check is not a valid location, it is 'unknown which is not a 5 element list. Then when a check fails it tries to output it, the list manipulation fails.

(require rackunit rackunit/text-ui)

(define-check (check3)
  (fail-check))

(run-tests (test-suite "tests" (let ((foo check3)) (foo))))
