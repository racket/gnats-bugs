>Description:
On Windows 10 (with newest major update), DrRacket's rendering of the _ character seems to be affected by the rendering of the line below, leading it to often be invisible.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Set font size to 5, 6, or 11
2. Type a line of text containing an underscore
    The underscore may not show up at all.
3. Fiddle with the buffer until the underscore is visible (try closing a pair of parens around it, highlighting... bumping the font size up and back down seems consistent)
4. Position the cursor on the line below the underscore
    It should slowly fade from black to white as the cursor blinks.

 Some specific things I noticed:
 
    - Having the cursor at the start of the line fades underscores 2 lines
    up; anywhere else fades them 1 line up
    - Deleting underscores doesn't remove them from the display immediately
    either
