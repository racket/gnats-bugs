>Description:
I have a really serious problem with DrRacket crashing whenever I use a two-fingered swipe gesture on Windows touch pad to try and scroll through the results after running the code. When this happens, the console window does not close, and DrRacket is unresponsive (can't click on anything or save anything). This only way to solve this is to forcibly guite the entire program using Windows and all my work is lost. When this happens, a window would pop up with three lines on it that says:

   send: no such method
   method name: is-floating?
   class name: wx-editor-canvas%

I really need to get this problem fixed as soon as possible, thank you.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrRacket
2. Type in a code 
3. Run the code
4. Scroll through the results using Windows touch pad
5. Crashes (As I was scrolling through this part, it crashed again)

 Thank you for the report, and I'm sorry that it has taken so long to
 get back to you. I wasn't able to get to this problem until now.
 
 Although I couldn't replicate the crash, the error message suggests a
 repair, so I'm hopeful that we have fixed the problem for the next
 release.
 
 If a repair is still useful to you, please try a snapshot build from
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/
 
 and let us know whether it behaves better.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
