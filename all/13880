 We have tracked down a problem that occurs when the AltGr key is needed
 to type "]".
 
 DrRacket gets stuck due to a bad implementation of an operation that is
 intended to be bound to Alt-]. Probably for you, though, the problem is
 that you didn't want the Alt-] keybinding at all; you're just trying to
 type ], and it's misinterpreted as Alt-].
 
 You can work around the problem by placing the five lines at the end of
 this message in a file, and then selecting the file via the
 
   Edit -> Keybindings -> Add User-defined Keybindings...
 
 menu item in DrRacket. Typing "]" should work immediately after, and
 typing "[" will also give you just "[" (instead of "[" and "]").
 
 Beware that after you select the file, it will be difficult to unselect
 it. It turns out the the menu item to un-select a keybindings file is
 also buggy! Your best bet is to put the file in a place that it can
 stay. (You can still edit the file and restart DrRacket if you just
 want to drop the bindings.)
 
 Of course, we will fix the bugs in the next release.
 
 Thanks for the report!
