>Description:
The rational? function in BSL produces positives when (at least in standard math) it shouldn't.

I understand that there's an argument to be made on the basis that (sqrt 2) and pi are inexact numbers represented fractionally. However, especially with HtDP/2e's only mention of rational? referring to one of "the familiar sets of numbers", this makes DrRacket look simply wrong to students and math teachers who know the meaning of "rational number". The function really should be amended or removed, IMO -- and if not, then at the very least this behavior should be justified in the docs.
