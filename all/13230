>Description:
Please add a method to the choice% widget to delete an item from the menu.

There is already append to add an item. But to remove an item, one must get all the items from the menu (looping with get-string and an index until out of bounds exception), clearing the menu, and then rebuilding the menu by adding the items individually with append.
