>Description:
Having the HISTORY files generated automatically is obviously nice, but
there is also a good value in being able to look at them directly.  For
example, trying to wade through the files in search of "focus" took a
bunch of time before I looked in "index.html" and saw that HISTORY_3.txt
is the only file that I should look into...

It would be nice if the files were generated with human readable names,
eg, by extending the information in `release-note-files'.
