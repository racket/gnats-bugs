Windows 8.1 64 bits
>Description:
it happens with DrRacket after you open some videogames at fullscreen

>How-To-Repeat:
For example when you open borderlands 2 DrRacket doesnt let the game show, its always on top.

tried emacs, visual studio, browsers, skype. nothing, just DrRacket.

also, this only happens if DrRacket is minimized. and not with all games

The Witcher for example doesnt do this.
