 What is the right thing to do here?
 
  a) load the teachpacks in that first run
  b) not display the teachpacks in that first run
  c) do not display the teachpacks at all

 Curiously, I was going to report this exact same bug last night.
 
 I simply don't understand how options (b) and (c) even make sense.

 Yeah, I'd do (a). You could make students add teachpacks each time
 they open DrScheme, I suppose, in which case (b) would become the de
 facto behavior. But I don't think that makes sense with files that
 have the teachpack listed.

 I don't think that those two have to be connected. Option b) was meant
 to be "leave the contents of the repl alone, and make the printout
 match them".

 Are you referring to a 'require' in the program with this sentence? If
 so, perhaps it is worth noting that drracket does not show the
 "Teachpack:" line when you use require.

 (b) doesn't make sense to me because if the student then hit F5, the
 Teachpacks would appear.  So there is state that is being hidden, and
 hiding it might be confusing: the Teachpack is there, but I don't see
 it, so I go to add it, but it's already added.  It seems to me the
 first REPL should act as if someone had already hit F5.

 Oh, another point related to Shriram's comments. This is all about
 making the state and the GUI match. There are several pieces of state
 here: the teachacks that are selected and will be run next time you
 hit the "Run" button. The teachpacks that were loaded last time the
 "Run" button was clicked and then the initial state. Currently, the
 menu items reflect the first of those and the stuff following the word
 "Teachpack:" reflects the second, except (as Todd points out) in the
 initial, program-less REPL. So, one way to fix this is to just remove
 the line that begin with "Teachpack:" from the initial REPL. That was
 option b).

 No, according to the PR it isn't, but only wrt to teachpacks that are
 loaded via the menu items.

 That'd be option d), I guess. But that would mean running a user's
 program when they open the file, which seems like a bad idea.

 Can we agree on this?
 
 * It is a bug for DrRacket to print a Teachpack line but for those
 * Teachpacks to not actually be in the REPL.  Ever.  At start-up or at
 * any other time.
 
 Then, the two logical choices seem to be:
 
 1. DrRacket forgets about Teachpacks on exit.  On re-start, it neither
 prints a Teachpack line nor remembers.  Hitting F5 (w/ an empty
 buffer, etc.) will not cause any change to the REPL.
 
 2. DrRacket remembers Teachpacks on exit.  On re-start, the REPL
 prints the Teachpack line AND the Teachpack is available for use.
 
 I prefer #2.  A person using Teachpacks is likely a less sophisticated
 user (eg, middle-schooler in Bootstrap).  We shouldn't force them to
 constantly remember which Teachpacks they need; they get into a config
 for their course and would like to just leave it there.
 
 A user who switches between lots of configurations probably wouldn't
 be using the menu-based Teachpacks anyway, they'd just be using
 (require ...), and they would be unaffected by all this.
 
 [Curiously, I am myself an exception to this claim this semester.  But
 I still think #2 is the right thing for DrRacket to do.]

 This was what I was calling option (a). My message (that crossed with
 yours in the email) explains why I think it is a bad idea.
 
 There are other options, of course.

 On second thought, I prefer option b. It still has the
 view-in-sync-with-the-model property, but it doesn't involve running
 arbitrary, possibly effectful code when you simply open a file for
 editing.
 
 (Option b was to not print "Teachpack: ..." in the initial REPL.)

 What exactly is your proposed alternative?
 
 It seems to be that the initial REPL NOT print "Teachpack" AND not
 have any loaded.  Good, model-view consistency.  But how is this
 consistent with remembering the Teachpacks, which you claim is good?
 
 If I hit F5, do the Teachpacks suddenly appear?  And if so, why should
 I have to hit F5?

 Should not and do not are different things. Since teachpacks come from
 source we don't control, I'm leery of that. Don't forget that anyone
 can add any module at any time as a teachpack and then the body of
 that module will run each time someone then opens a file for editing.
 
 While it seems unlikely that the body of the teachpack does "rm -rf
 /", it could easily do something that takes time and thus make
 DrRacket seem sluggish (esp on windows when touching the file system
 can easily involve the network and permissions errors that take time
 to report, etc).

 There is no inconsistency between model and view here, only
 inconsistency between the student's opinion of what the model should
 be and what the model is (and, of course, that's bad too).
 
 Given our disagreement and my attempt at clarification above, if that
 does not convince you and/or Shriram and/or Todd that (a) may be a bad
 idea, then I'll just go with it. Esp. considering that teachpacks in
 this manner are something we are moving away from.

 Hopefully my message to Matthias clarified most of this, but one more
 thing I'll repeat: there are two pieces of state in the model here
 (and we cannot go away from that I don't think), namely the teachpacks
 that are selected for the next time a REPL is created and there are
 the teachpacks that were in place the last time the REPL was created.

 Oops, that should have ".... do do you have an opinion?".

 Right, agreed. Not a security hole. Just an "annoyance" hole. Worst
 case this is a source of bug reports and confusion and disparaging
 remarks on how drracket is slow (but we ignore lots of these kinds of
 messages already).

 Sorry: pending a fix to this PR, there is no inconsistency. (I had

 If that's not already happening already, then I don't think that we

 I think probably we just want to abandon the entire language
 dialog-based teaching languages at some point in the distant future
 instead.

 Matthias, dropping Teachpacks is not easy until creating languages is
 easy.
 
 Just this past month, I spent two weeks struggling to create a
 language for my course that was like ASL but had some added features.
 check-expect didn't work right, images in the REPL didn't work right,
 something else cropped up that my TAs had trouble explaining, and
 goodness knows what other mysteries lurked.  In desperation, the
 morning my class began, I finally tossed it all out and in 15 minutes
 created a Teachpack on top of ASL, and everything is just peachy.
 
 It may be I could have done the same with a language, but (a) the docs
 were just not up to it, (b) the replies I got on the list were only a
 approximation of what I needed, and (c) DrRacket isn't set up for
 this, either (since it hard-codes various languages) -- eg, if I were
 building on top of ISL, I still wouldn't get the Stepper.
 
 So no, it's not just Emu that's hurt.  DrRacket just isn't set up
 right now for languages to take the place of Teachpacks, and we need
 *something* to take their place for beginners of all shapes and sizes.

 I'm sure you know most of this, Shriram, but the exercise of us
 getting "#lang htdp/isl" going is going to make this path smoother for
 those not familiar with the guts of Racket and don't have the energy
 to become so (like you) but (and this is where you may be
 disappointed) I don't think that the stepper is ever going to be
 language independent. At least not without research.

 Just in case this is related to Matthias's original question of why
 not drop teachpacks: I think there are enough people using this and
 have notes to that effect that we would get many loud complaints if we
 dropped them. Much much easier to maintain them, imo.

 Because of the overhead of having to use require correctly when you
 can barely write simple expressions.

 You're conflating Racket with DrRacket, which is (as far as I can
 tell) incorrect.  Even understanding Racket fairly well doesn't help
 me know what on earth to do with DrRacket.  Of course, lots of other
 systems have the same problem (being proficient with Java doesn't make
 you an expert in extending Eclipse).

 One way to look at this is that we're moving more and more to a place
 where drracket merely reflects what's in the definitions window with
 better ways to view it, etc. Thus all of the configuation / language
 building stuff becomes racket stuff, not drracket. (For example, the
 place where you got stuck with printing is all racket stuff, nothing
 to do with drracket).
 
 This definitely isn't true now, but that's where we're moving.
 
 I don't really think it is worth our time to spend too much energy
 emailing about this. The above is a short explanation and if you still
 don't agree, please just chalk it up to "you don't understand how
 things are organized in the guts" and come back in a few years and see
 if you change your mind.

 The logic was supposed to go something like
 
 a) you said that you don't get various things, including the stepper
 
 b) I said that some of that will get better.
 
 c) I then meant to clarify that by saying "there are no plans for
 making the stepper better in this regard because we don't know how to"
 (hence enter research).
 
 Hope that clarifies.

 I don't understand this remark.
 
 We were talking about a menu.  You suggested removing the menu and
 moving this into something the user writes manually.  But now you're
 talking about a menu entry again.
 
 If you're willing to talk about menus, then we're back where we
 started.  Exactly how it operates is irrelevant; for all I know that's
 what it already does.  In fact, arguably,
 
   Teachpack: image.rkt
 
 is already "an uneditable snip" and all I can do is delete it (via a
 menu).

 Yes, I have noticed that, and I greatly like that direction.  (We have
 actually been going in that direction for 15 years, not just lately.)

 I agree entirely.
 
 So if there's going to be a new architecture down the road where many
 things become irrelevant/replaced with other mechanisms, that's fine.
 But it seems that's still some ways away, and for now we're still
 stuck with the current menus.  Furthermore, even in that new world, we
 may need some meta-programming to makes easy cases easy.
 
 [I've actually been composing a message about that, re. languages, for
 a few days now, which I will send separately.]

 Right, sure. Right now we're in a place where we have some of that
 kind of stuff (syntax/parse say) and where we just have the rawest,
 lowest level interface (and in some places not even that, at least as
 far as the teaching languages go).
