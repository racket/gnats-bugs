>Description:
Normally functions that provide events (evt?) document what values are returned as the synchronization result.

My first intuition would be that it is the result of the promise but it seems that it is just (void).
>How-To-Repeat:
(define v (delay/sync 4))
(force v)
(sync v)

=>
4 ;; From the force
;; Nothing from the sync
>Fix:
