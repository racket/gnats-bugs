>Description:
A lot of plists have dates in them, the current implementation of read-plist doesn't accept them, resulting in it breaking it's contract when attempting to parse a plist with dates. It seems to me that it should convert them into a date structure (from racket/date) just as it converts <false/> into #f.
>How-To-Repeat:
parsing the following plist:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>jobAttributes</key>
	<dict>
		<key>dateStopped</key>
		<date>2013-05-10T20:29:55Z</date>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>

produces the following error:

read-plist: broke its contract
 promised: plist-value?
 produced: '(dict (assoc-pair "jobAttributes" (dict (assoc-pair "dateStopped" #<void>))))
 in: the range of
      (-> input-port? plist-value?)
 contract from: <collects>/xml/plist.rkt

 Or, since date parsing can be very easy to mess up, it might make more sens=
 e to just convert it to a string, so that the plist in the example I gave w=
 ould instead be parsed as '(dict (assoc-pair "jobAttributes" (dict (assoc-p=
 air "dateStopped" (date "2013-05-10T20:29:55Z"))))), though that would lead=
  to the possibility of accidentally being able to write an invalid plist by=
  passing it a badly formatted date string.
