 racket/contract/base is an attempt to provide a smaller version of the
 contract library, but I consider it a failure in that regard because
 the startup footprint of it is not substantially smaller than the
 startup footprint of racket/contract itself.
 
 It has lived on because it helps some of the other libraries in the
 standard distribution get contracts as the non-base parts of the
 contract library depend on them.
 
 I have not documented it yet because I was hoping that I could do
 something better with it (it has a valuable name, but it isn't
 valuable enough to warrant that name, imo).
 
 Why did you want to use it?

 Ryan blogged about it here http://macrologist.blogspot.com/2011/10/lazy-module-loading.html, and I assumed that it was like racket/base. If it doesn't have the smaller startup footprint then it is not of much use to me.
