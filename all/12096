When the following character sequence is typed, and when the magic open-bracket preference is selected:

    (syntax-case 'foo [


I expect to see that the open square bracket is a round paren, but it's not.  What's affecting it is the presence of the quote in front of foo.  The same thing happens with anything that provides implicit structure, like


    (syntax-case #'my-stx [

 Thanks! That bug had been bothering me for some time and I never made
 the connection that it was the quote (or hash-quote) that was the
 buggy problem. It just seemed to not work sometimes and work other
 times.
