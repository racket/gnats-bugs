>Description:
I just loaded a 6.4.0.5 Debian Wheezy executable onto a Debian 8 box.   Here's a loop with a square root call on the new and the old executables run each a couple of times.

Welcome to Racket v6.4.0.5.

The same box running on 6.2.1:

cpu time: 80 real time: 79 gc time: 3
cpu time: 70 real time: 71 gc time: 0
cpu time: 74 real time: 71 gc time: 0
cpu time: 70 real time: 70 gc time: 0

cpu time: 70 real time: 70 gc time: 3
cpu time: 70 real time: 70 gc time: 7
cpu time: 70 real time: 70 gc time: 3
cpu time: 70 real time: 72 gc time: 7


I think that the 6.2.1 was the default Debian version.  At any rate, the 6.2.1 is labeled

BuildID[sha1]=f5f9724535487ee9d1847f49818ab33e75aeee6d

The 6.4.0.5 is

BuildID[sha1]=0125231c8e04fce477e74dfefff5bec8396f41aa

I just found a 6.3.0.10 installed on the same machine which acts the same as the newer 6.4.0.5.

Thanks,
JG

 Are both of those 64-bit Racket, or is the old one 32-bit Racket?
 
 (I get results similar to yours if I compare a 64-bit build to a 32-bit
 build on my machine, independent of the specific version.)
