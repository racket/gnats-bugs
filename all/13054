>Description:
The following program should work but gives the error:

-struct/dc: expected an identifier that names a field
  at: heap-v
  in: (-struct/dc new-heap (heap-v any/c))
  context...:
   /Users/endobson/proj/racket/plt/collects/racket/contract/private/struct-dc.rkt:513:9: for-loop
   /Users/endobson/proj/racket/plt/collects/racket/contract/private/struct-dc.rkt:488:0: parse-struct/dc
   /Users/endobson/proj/racket/plt/collects/racket/contract/private/struct-dc.rkt:648:0: do-struct/dc
   #f::5565: standard-module-name-resolver

I shouldn't need to have the struct name bound to the same symbolic name as its definition for struct/c to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(module foo racket
  (struct heap (v) #:transparent)
  (provide (rename-out (heap new-heap))))

(require 'foo)

(struct/c new-heap any/c)

 This also doesn't work with struct-copy (as below).
 
 #lang racket/base
 (require racket/contract)
 (module m racket/base
   (struct s (a))
   (provide (rename-out [s m:s])
            s
            s-a))
 (require 'm)
 (struct-copy m:s (m:s 1) [a 2])  ;; doesn't work
 (struct-copy s (s 1) [a 2])      ;; does
