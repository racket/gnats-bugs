>Description:
It appears twice in the same scrbl file.

1) In the documentation about "Enabling and Disabling Breaks" there is a reference to the inexistent function with-break-parameterization. It should say call-with-break-parameterization.

http://docs.racket-lang.org/inside/exceptions.html#(part._.Enabling_and_.Disabling_.Breaks)

It says : [...]To enable or disable breaks during the dynamic extent of another evaluation (where you would use with-break-parameterization in Racket), [...]

2) Same problem in "scheme_push_break_enable" documentation

http://docs.racket-lang.org/inside/exceptions.html#%28cpp._scheme_push_break_enable%29

It says : [...]to enable or disable breaks in the same way as with-break-parameterization; this function writes to cframe to initialize it, [...]
