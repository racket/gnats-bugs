>Description:
Choosing the MacOS option "Hide DrRacket" does seem to make the window hide, *but* then it re-appears almost instantly (albeit not as the active app).  Presumably some event is being triggered that makes its windows re-appear.

This occurs even if I "safe boot".  I also noticed this under v6.12[3m]; it was okay/correct back under v6.10[3m].
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket on MacOS, with at least one window open.  Choose menu option "DrRacket > Hide DrRacket (command-H)".
>Fix:
