>Description:
The program below creates a frame with a menu bar with one menu containing one menu item. The menu item uses a demand-callback to check the menu item when its enclosing menu is opened, but the demand-callback is never called.

Run the program below. Open the frame's menu (labeled "my menu items"). When the menu opens, its single menu item should be checked, but it isn't. Also, "demanded!" should be printed to stderr, but it isn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define f
  (new frame% (label "frame") (width 400) (height 400)))
(define menubar
  (new menu-bar% (parent f)))
(define my-menu
  (new menu% (label "my menu items") (parent menubar)))
(new checkable-menu-item% 
     (label "a checkable item")
     (parent my-menu)
     (callback
      (lambda _ 
        (eprintf "callback!\n")))
     (demand-callback
      (lambda (me)
        (eprintf "demanded!\n")
        (send me check #t))))
(send f show #t)
