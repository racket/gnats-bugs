 Do you have an example input for which `inexact->exact` gives you an
 unexpected result?
 
 A thing to keep in mind is that rational numbers (e.g., `3/4`) are
 exact, and so can be returned from `inexact->exact` as is. That's as
 opposed to `0.75`, which is a floating-point (i.e., inexact) number.
 
 Depending on the language and settings you're using, it may be that the
 latter is read as an exact number, in which case you're really getting
 the former.
