>Description:
Switching tabs can reset the position of the scroll bars in one of the tabs, when in the split-screen view.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a multi-screenfuls-long file.
View -> Split.
Scroll down a ways in each pane and put the cursor in the onscreen portion of each.
Create a new tab.
Go back to the original tab.  One or both panes are now scrolled to the top of the file.  Switching back and forth between already-created tabs also appears to clobber the scroll state.
