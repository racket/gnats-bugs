Hi, 

The 'blue box'(1) in doesn't reliably select the identifier at the insertion point.

pressing f2 seems to do double duty as locking the documentation open and selecting a new identifier.

(1) I think 'bluebox' is the name for the pop-down documentation that for the current selected identifier. The DrRacket manual doesn't really cover this functionality AFAICT.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. ensure background check syntax is enabled.
2. place the insertion point in a identifier
3. click [check syntax] 
4. check top-right popup is showing identifier documentation summary 
5. click another identifier
6. check top-right popup - is NOT showing documentation summary for newly selected identifier.

 I think that probably the right fix for this is to change the way the
 check syntax button works so that greys itself out, but others does
 nothing and waits for online expansion to finish.
 
 Does that seem okay to you?

 I like greying the button until it is finished - I think that is a great
 indicator (animating the button would be even better!) , but I don't
 understand - check syntax appears to have finished (arrows etc) by the time
 the pop down is not showing the documentation for the identifier at the
 insertion point.
 
 Kind regards and thanks for your attention,
 Stephen

 Oh, sorry: I'm saying that currently the online check syntax and the
 button are fighting with each other and that sibling rivalry is
 causing bad behavior (probably more than what you report here in this
 bug, but I'm not sure exactly what...), corrupting internal data
 structures somehow. So my proposed fix is to merely make the button
 not do anything (so there are no longer two things to fight with each
 other).
 
 Does that explain better?

 Yes, it does. But I'll admit don't understand the difference between
 'online check syntax' and the check syntax button. Is the F2 one of these?
 
 Thanks again for your help and patience.

 Ah: we're getting into embarrasing details of the current implementation now. :)
 
 When you press the check syntax button, then DrRacket expands and
 grovels over the expanded program, collecting information about where
 arrows should go and things like that. Also, separately (altho reusing
 much of the code (but not all)) when a certain (short) timeout has
 expired, DrRacket does that same process (but in a different `place`).
 Once that process has completed, this information is made available to
 you in a variety of ways, one of those ways is when you press f2 (or
 when you move your mouse around or right click on various things).
 
 So f2 isn't really running the process of checking syntax (which is
 also a historical and thus terrible name), it's looking at the result
 of doing that process. And that's probably the root of the bug: the
 two slightly different versions of the process are probably not doing
 quite the right thing to cause the error you wrote about in the
 initial PR.

 Thank you for the insight. Am I right in guessing check syntax will be
 retired in favour of the integrated DrRacket code? or are the two passes
 required - like a compiler?
 
 As for the name - why not change it if you don't like it?
 
 Thanks again for your help,
 
 Stephen

 I'm not sure. But in general, to run Racket code, it must be compiled
 (and one of those steps is expansion); for DrRacket to annotate your
 code with the arrows and the documentation links, only the expansion
 step needs to be done, so that's all it does in that case.
 
 Mostly I just need to clean up this particular interaction to avoid the bug.
 
 But as advice to you, I would just say to not bother clicking that
 button any more and instead wait for the green dot to appear in the
 bottom right corner of the DrRacket window.

 It has been around so long, I guess. I mostly don't think it needs a
 name; it should just be part of the background functionality of
 editing code in DrRacket, ideally.
