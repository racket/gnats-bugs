>Description:
The behavior of "load/use-compiled" has changed from DrScheme 4.2.5 to
5.3.6.  The change is not documented in the "Porting from v4.x to v5.x" section of the release notes.

The error message:
current-load-relative-directory: path is not a complete path
  path: port/
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file test1.scm containing 

   #lang scheme
   (load/use-compiled "subdir/test2.scm")

where test1.scm and subdir are in the same directory.

In DrRacket 5.3.6 run test1.scm.
