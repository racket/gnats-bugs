>Description:
The Window<%> type definition does not include the method `is-enabled?` which it should according to the window<%> documentation.

The method type should be
[is-enabled? (-> Boolean)]
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the program:

#lang typed/racket
(require typed/racket/gui)
(define parent (new frame% [label "parent"]))
(define w (new canvas% [parent parent] [label "canvas"]))
(send w is-enabled?)
