To do the same thing in *SL, you have to write 10-15 lines of code, covering all the combinations of positive, negative, and zero dx and dy.

If you don't want to expose an [additional] function with a variable number of arguments in *SL, call it "atan2".

 I guess one problem is that I don't see a use of atan or atan2. What do you need them for? What are you going to show students with atan2?
