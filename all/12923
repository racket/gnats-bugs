>Description:
When you have a program for which live check syntax signals an error, 
it appears impossible to copy the text of the error message so that 
you can submit it with a bug report. See PR 12922 for an example. 

It would be really nice if one could highlight and copy this text. 
(I tried; if this functionality is available, apologies I couldn't 
figure it out.)
