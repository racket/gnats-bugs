>Description:
Scribble appears to use #hash(...) notation sometimes when it should be using #hasheq(...) or #hasheqv(...).  The results are inconsistent between examples, the below program on my computer results in #hash for the hash and hasheq examples, and #hasheqv for the hasheqv examples.

Normal programs at the racket repl print properly.

@examples[
(make-immutable-hash null)
(make-immutable-hasheq null)
(make-immutable-hasheqv null)
#hash()
#hasheq()
#hasheqv()
