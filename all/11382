>Description:
After calling (call/cc thread) a few times, racket (both GUI and command line) crashes.
>How-To-Repeat:
The program:

#lang racket

(define (f)
  (write 1)
  (call/cc thread)
  (write 2)
  (call/cc thread)
  (write 3))

(f)

Load this in DrRacket and click run.
DrRacket crashes immediately.
