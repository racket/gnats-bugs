>Description:
1. Guide, sixth line before start of section 6.1.2: comamnd -> command


2. Guide, 8.1

There is this paragraph:

Instead of having to match open-input-file and open-output-file calls,
most Racket programmers will instead use call-with-output-file,
which takes a function to call with the output port;
when the function returns, the port is closed.

The context of this paragraph ie. the explanations and examples are enough to
make clear what the paragraph means but here is my suggestion:

Instead of having to match the open calls with close calls, most Racket
programmers will use call-with-input-file and call-with-output-file functions
which take a function to call to carry out the desired operation. This
function gets as its only argument the port that is automatically opened and
closed for the operation.


3. Guide, 8.4

Second paragraph, last sentence:
   In neither can the result be read back in as an instance of the structure type:
==>
   In neither case can the result be read back in as an instance of the structure type:
