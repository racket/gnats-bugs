 If you're pointing out the usage of the word "stream "in:
 
     http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/i_o.html
 
 then I believe the intent here is to use the word "stream" in the
 general sense, as in:
 
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)
 
 that is, as a sequential source or sink of data.  I do not think the
 intent here is to use the term in a particularly racket/stream sense.
 
 The Guide doesn't actually talk about streams in the racket/stream
 sense, as far as I can tell.

 I think that's true, but perhaps we can reword things a bit to avoid this
 particular confusion. It can dangerous when a word is use in an informal
 sense and there, in a nearby manual/chapter, is a precise technical
 definition of the word that would conflict or confuse.

 How would this sound as a potential rewrite?

 A Racket port represents a source or sink of data, such as a
 file, a terminal, a TCP connection, or an in-memory string.
 Ports provide sequential access in which data can be read or
 written a piece of a time, without requiring the data to be
 consumed or produced all at once.  More specifically, an input
 port represents a source from which a program can read data, and
 an output port represents a sink to which a program can write
 data.

 I like that!
 
 If someone thought it were important, one could add a paragraph after that
 saying something like "racket ports correspond to the unix notion of a
 stream (not to be confused with @racketmodname[racket/stream]'s streams".

 Ok, sounds good.  I'll commit a patch shortly as soon as I can verify
 I haven't introduced a compile-time error in the document.  :P
