>Description:
I'm not sure if this should be a change-request or a bug report, but the style-delta% 'change-normal-color does not change the styles back to the way they were before any styles were applied.

Run the code below and click the button. The display shouldn't change. You should always see black text on a gray background. Before the click, I see that, but afterwards I see white background behind positions 1-6 in the editor.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/gui

(define on-sd (make-object style-delta%))
(send on-sd set-delta-foreground "lightgray")
(send on-sd set-delta-background "firebrick")

(define off-sd (make-object style-delta% 'change-normal-color))

(define t%
  (class text%
    (define/override (on-paint before? dc left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret)
      (when before?
        (let ([pen (send dc get-pen)]
              [brush (send dc get-brush)])
          (send dc set-brush "lightgray" 'solid)
          (send dc set-pen "black" 1 'transparent)
          (send dc draw-rectangle left top (- right left) (- bottom top))
          (send dc set-pen pen)
          (send dc set-brush brush)))
      (super on-paint before? dc left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret))
    (super-new)))

(define t (new t%))
(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 300] [height 300]))
(define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
(send t insert "abc  fg")
(define b (new button%
               [parent f]
               [label "button"]
               [callback
                (Î» x
                  (send t change-style on-sd 1 6)
                  (send t change-style off-sd 0 (send t last-position))
                  (send ec refresh))]))

 Also, I realized that I coudln't find a way to actually make the style
 work properly myself.
 
 FWIW, this is a problem for the latest version of the teaching
 languages untested code highlighting. When the highlighting is
 disabled, the background is always white in the places where unrun
 code was.
 
 I think the right fix is either to change 'change-normal-color so that
 it sets the mult to 1 and the add to 0, or to give me a way to do
 that.

 I think the issue here is that `set-background-color' turns off
 transparent text backing, in addition to setting the background color.
 I'll fix the docs.
 
 To re-enable the transparent background:
 
   (send off-sd set-transparent-text-backing-on #t)
