 Unfortunately, snapshots are only "good" in this sense for a week or
 two. After that time, the snapshot-specific catalog gets replaced on
 the snapshot server.
 
 You can keep using a snapshot after its specific catalog goes away, but
 you'll need to drop the snapshot-specific package catalog through the
 "Settings" tab in the "Package Manager..." dialog in DrRacket (or by
 using `raco pkg config --set catalogs` on the command line).

 I just tried backing to the 6.6 release.  Everything worked fine.  I
 noticed the settings were different.  I copied those settings into the
 6.6.0.5 version, but that also did not work.
