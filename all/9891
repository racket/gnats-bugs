>Description:
When debugging some forms of infinite recursion in DrScheme, if the "Go" button is pressed and no breakpoints are set, it is impossible to stop the program.  It appears that a garbage collector or something runs on a periodic basis (~1 Hz for me), presumably preventing DrScheme from hitting the memory limit which would stop the application from running.  Additionally, the pause/stop buttons are non-responsive.  This does not occur in trivial infinite recursion.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, I fixed my test case and can't remember how I did it offhand - will update if I figure it out.

Reason>>> No test case was ever provided.


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:44:16 -0500
