>Description:
It is possible to choose 'no' radio button on the languages choice dialog. This then produces a GUI error and leaves DrRacket in an inconsistent state.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open language choice dialog
2. When given the choice on the rhs of "Debugging and Profiling", "Debugging"... etc, click on one of the radio buttons twice. It will select and deselect so you have no radio button selected for that set.
3. Click ok and have fun with the errors.

 This doesn't seem possible under mac os x; so does that mean that this
 is a gracket-level bug?
