>Description:
The array access in array-set! is wrong for arrays with > 2 dimensions.
The first n-1 indicies are used in reverse order (see sample) because the index list is reversed to extract the last index and value and then used without reversing it again.

A patch would be:
collects/ffi/unsafe.rkt
1020c1020
<       (let loop ([a a] [is (reverse (cddr is+v))])
---
>       (let loop ([a a] [is (cddr is+v)])
>How-To-Repeat:
(define _t (_array _int 20 10 5))
(define ar (ptr-ref (malloc _t) _t))

(array-ref ar 19 9 4) ; works
(array-set! ar 19 9 4 0) ; fails
(array-set! ar 9 19 4 0) ; works
