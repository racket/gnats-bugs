Run the following program:

#lang typed/racket

(define-type (Listof* A) (Rec T (U A (Listof T))))

(require/typed
 racket/list
 [flatten  (All (A) ((Listof* A) -> (Listof A)))])

(flatten '())


Get this error:

flat-rec-contract: expected flat contracts as arguments, got #<impersonator-single-or/c>

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Sat, 14 Jul 2012 23:12:00 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed just now with rev
1dca82784b664e7640053333fec85980159cbd16 .

Note that this fix doesn't make that type generate a useful
contract, which isn't possible in general, but it no longer
gives an internal error.


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:14:19 -0500
Reason>>> samth closed
