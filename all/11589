>Description:
The program below draws an orange rectangle with a slightly darker orange line along the upper and left edges of the rectangle. I think it should not have those darker edges.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define bm (make-bitmap 75 75))
(define bdc (make-object bitmap-dc% bm))
(send bdc erase)

(send bdc set-brush "orange" 'solid)
(send bdc set-pen "black" 1 'transparent)
(send bdc draw-rectangle 0 0 70 70)

(send bdc set-bitmap #f)
(make-object image-snip% bm)

(define (draw c dc)
  (send dc set-alpha .5)
  (send dc draw-bitmap bm 10 10))

(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200] [height 200]))
(define c (new canvas% [parent f] [paint-callback draw]))
(send f show #t)
