>Description:
I was trying to make an example to show how
metafunctions cannot be used in a higher-order
way, which led to a strange error message,
which I was able to boil down to the following
program which uses a metafunction in non-app
position, yet does not error.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require redex)

(define-language L)

(define-metafunction L
  [(i any) any])

(define-metafunction L 
  [(z any) (0)])

(term (i z 4)) ; => 0
;; Should be an error that z
;; must be used in application
