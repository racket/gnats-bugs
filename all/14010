>Description:
URI decoding for non-ASCII UTF-8 seems to loop forever. At least for the examples below. It infinitely loops in the recursive (internal-decode l) routine at line 171 in uri-codec.rkt.

Changing the recursive call "(internal-decode l)" at line 187 to "rest" seems to fix the problem. But I need someone who knows the code better to verify it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Calls like
(uri-decode "http://www.khodnevis.org/persian/%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C/%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%A7/12546-صندلی-خالی-احمد-زیدآبادی-در-مراسم-اعطای-جازه-جهانی-ازادی-بیان-یو.html")
or
(uri-decode "http://www.khodnevis.org/persian/رسانه\u200Cهای-خودمانی/حقوق-بشر-میدیا/12546-صندلی-خالی-احمد-زیدآبادی-در-مراسم-اعطای-جازه-جهانی-ازادی-بیان-یو.html")
goes into an infinite loop.

 It turns out that this isn't actually an infinite loop, just an extremely
 inefficient one because of an unnecessary recursive call when dealing with
 non-ASCII characters, which makes it basically O(2^n) for non-ASCII
 (portions of the) strings. So, the offending URLs in the bug report do
 eventually terminate after several hours - as opposed to fractions of a
 second with the fix.
 
 So, (short) test cases would have passed without anyone likely noticing the
 performance issue for longish strings.
