>Description:
IIUC from everything so far, the "create" command should be handed the
parent directory of a collection(s) that is to be distributed.  This
makes it inconvenient to just package a specified collection path
collection path: to do that, I'd need to create a new directory and
package it from there.

Suggestion: instead of specifying the parent of collection directory,
specify the collection directories directly.  So instead of (for
example):

    raco pkg create ~/.racket/5.3.3/collects

you list the collection directly:

    raco pkg create ~/.racket/5.3.3/collects/foo

Since I'm suggesting doing this with multiple collections, the previous
mode of work is easily achieved with:

    raco pkg create ~/.racket/5.3.3/collects/*

The only inconvenience that this introduces is specifying the output
file, but this is minor as it is required by practically all archivers
(which is what this thing is anyway).

I'm *not* suggesting some heuristic based on the parent directory,
since in the above case (which I expect to be popular) you'd end up with
"collects.zip".

Note that it would also resolve the problem I mentioned earlier of
running a bogus create command and ending up with bad dir-less contents.
It would also resolve the problem that Robby reported wrt an empty
directory.

 I will change the docs to clarify that "pkg create" is for turning a
 /package directory/ (described in docs) into a /package archive/ (also in
 docs).
 
 Thus this request is out of scope
 
 I would happily accept a patch that added a command like "packagify" that
 took a list of collection directories and made a vanilla package archive.
 (I say vanilla because it would not have the extra metadata, although maybe
 you would also be able to name a metadata file.)

 I used to think something like that, but I tried phrasing my suggestion in the form of a patch, and that attempt changed my mind.
 
 You may conclude otherwise, but in general, I think we're well into the point where suggestions as patches are best.

 Any quick description why it failed?

 The clarification of the current way it works is fine, but it still
 looks like a more convenient setup so why is it out of scope?

 My guess for your weird choice of "packagify" and "vanilla" is that a
 package requires having an info file for the meta data -- which would
 need to be made constructed somehow.  Is that correct?  If so, maybe
 this is the problem Matthew had with it?

 I do not find it convenient. I think it is more convenient for my
 development environment to match what users have, so I want to have the
 explicit package directory in existence.

 It is not required for all packages. But if you want to have dependencies
 or additional setup instructions, then it is.

 Let me rephrase my question: is there a *technical* reason that makes
 it better?
 
 The subjective opinion is most definitely invalid in my case: I have a
 whole bunch of places with code, and practically none of them look
 like a dedicated directory holding a bunch of collections that would
 be considered a package.  So in my case, naming the collection
 directories would be far more convenient, as in "works with my
 directory structure without changing anything" vs "need to start move
 things around to make it work".
 
 (And incidentally, several of these places where I have code have been
 set more than a decade ago, when I was a user.)

 Yes, because pkg create is just supposed to turn a directory into an
 archive. That is its technical purpose.
 
 I don't think your proposal has a technical purpose. I think it just has a
 subjective purpose of creating a package archive from "something" "easily".
 Clearly "easily" is subjective.
 
 And as I said before, I think it is unwise to create a package archive from
 anything other than a package directory. You may disagree and I won't stand
 in your way. But I don't think your goal should take over "pkg create"
 although maybe it means it should be named differently.
 
 I don't think your past projects from decades ago are relevant, because
 they are not packages, were not designed as packages, and you should not be
 surprised if turning them in to packages requires some conversion, like the
 horribly onerous combination of "mkdir" and "mv". (I shudder at the amount
 of time this will take.)

 The subjective opinion is most definitely invalid in my case: I have a<br>

 like a dedicated directory holding a bunch of collections that would<br>

 I thought it would be a simpler path for people who already understand
 collections, but it turned out to be more complex and more confusing to
 have more ways of doing things.

  | raco pkg create: support "source" and "binary" bundling
  | 
  | Adds `--from-dir' and `--from-install' flags to select the interpretation
  | of the argument as a directory or as the name of an installed package.
  | Relevant to PR 13669
  | 
  | Adds `--as-is' (the default), `--source', and `--binary' flags to
  | select a pruning mode.
  | 
  | The `raco setup' tool recognizes a `rendered-scribblings' specification
  | in "info.rkt" to trigger moving rendered documentation into place,
  | registering its tags in the cross-reference database, and fixing up
  | references to "local-redirect.js"; the presence of a "synced.rktd"
  | indicates when those fixups have been performed (since, if the package
  | is installed in a user-specific scope, the documentation doesn't actually
  | move anywhere). Finally, "out<n>.sxref" needs to report paths relative to
  | the documentation's directory, and then the relative-directory references
  | need to be suitably resolved at derserialization; some support for such
  | relative paths was in place, but it wasn't quite general enough before.
