>Description:
Calling get-current-mouse-state causes instant crash to desktop on OS X 10.5.5 32 bit. (Only tested on an emulated machine running in Virtualbox, so it could be a 'hackintosh' issue though unlikely.) The OS X error log seems to indicate that an unsupported API call is made:

  | fix for `get-current-mouse-state' on Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier
  | 
  | It looks like button-press information is not available on 10.5
  | and earlier, so so try to report it in that case.
