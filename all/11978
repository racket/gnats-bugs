>Description:
`procedure-arity-includes?' (relatives too, but this one is particularly bad) can make
you make assumptions that are untrue with keyworded functions.  Maybe add some `#:raw?'
flag for the current behavior, and otherwise make it always return #f if there are
required keyword?  (`procedure-arity' is trickier, since sometimes it's used to build
keyworded functions, so returning something like an empty list sounds bad; maybe it
should throw an error?)
