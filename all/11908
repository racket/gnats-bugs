 I think that it is not possible to run check syntax on files that
 DrRacket shares between the user's space and DrRacket's space.

 Could the error message say so?

 That should be communicated to end users better though.

 That would be better. I'm not sure how to test for that property tho
 (regexps on error messages aside).
 
 And, of course, it may be possible that a tweak to the module system
 will make this possible again or maybe I'm missing a way to set things
 up already, I'm not sure.

 IIRC, the last time this came up we decided that 
 expand-top-level-with-compile-time-evals was unnecessary for Check 
 Syntax with the Module language. The module only needs to be expanded; 
 the module declaration doesn't need to be evaluated.

 So ... it was just a mistake on my part that I didn't remove it? Ugh.

 Well, languages based on a top level (which were more common then, I 
 think) still need the compile-time-evals part. So it's not a trivial change.

 From what I can tell DrRacket is just running expand (in eval.rkt). So
 I guess I did make that change a while back.

 There's a call to 'eval-compile-time-part-of-top-level' in 
 drracket/private/syncheck/gui.rkt. Removing that seems to fix the problem.
