>Description:
In the program below, on Linux, if the slider reaches the max value, then trying to click to the left of the slider will have no effect.  At this point, the slider will only respond to direct grabs on its handle.

This seems to be platform-dependent; I don't see this behavior on Mac OS X or Windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the following program on Linux:

#lang scheme/gui

(define f (new frame% [label ""]))
(define s (new slider% [label #f][parent f][min-value 0] [max-value 5]))
(send f show #t)


Set the value of the slider to 5.  Then click on the scroll bar to try decreasing the value.  It doesn't respond.
