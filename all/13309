>Description:
After installing 5.3.1.9 my planet development link had been cleared, and as a consequence, running a test file that uses the link gives the expected error message "require: PLaneT could not find the package".

However, I was confused when first loading the test file in DrRacket and the syntax checker showed status "Background expansion finished", but the indicator dot on DrRacket's status line showed red, with tooltip message "tcp-connect: forbidden client access to planet.racket-lang.org:80".

I think it would be more useful if the background checker displayed a more appropriate status message stating the issue in getting the package from planet.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open new tab in DrRacket and add a require to a non-existent planet package, e.g.:

(require (planet abcxyz/abcxyz))

Observe background expansion finished message and red dot status.

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sun, 23 Dec 2012 13:29:26 -0500
Reason>>> 
an earlier commit changed the meaning of the red dot to be more intuitive (all 
errors, no matter why, turn the dot red now; before drracket tried to special 
case online-expansion-specific errors (like the security guard) and only turn 
the dot red for those; similarly, the error message is now always in the bar 
along the bottom, regardless of the reason for the error)


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:05:06 -0500
