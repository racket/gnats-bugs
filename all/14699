>Description:
The documented contract is:
(get-coverage) â†’ (listof (cons/c syntax? boolean?))

However get coverage is actually returning two lists. This also causes annotate-covered-file to error with:

-> (annotate-covered-file "x.rkt")
; result arity mismatch;
;  expected number of values not received
;   expected: 1
;   received: 2
; [,bt for context]


This is occuring on 6.1 as well as HEAD
>How-To-Repeat:
Have some file x.rkt:

#lang racket
(define (foo x) (if x 1 (if x 2 1)))
(equal? (foo #t) 1)


then, from the command line:

>racket -i -l errortrace
-> (coverage-counts-enabled #t)
-> (require "x.rkt")
#t
-> (get-coverage)
'()
'(<some values here> ...)
-> (annotate-covered-file "x.rkt")
; result arity mismatch;
;  expected number of values not received
;   expected: 1
;   received: 2
; [,bt for context]
