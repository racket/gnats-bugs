>Description:
This is a change request; it leads to data loss 
for me whenever it happens.

The problem arises when both the definitions and
interactions window refer to the same path. This
occurs for me when I'm trying to change the name
of the file. See the sequence of steps below.

Note that doing this involves a certain amount
of stupidity, but it's happened to me enough
times to be sad. I think the solution is this:
when DrRacket saves the definitions or inter-
actions window, it should check to see whether
the other window has the same path. If so, I
would suggest that it signal an error or 
perhaps just set the path of the other window
to #f.

Is this the kind of change that I could easily
make myself?
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open a file with some path.
2) Run it (note that focus is now on the
interactions window, oops).
3) Use C-x C-w to save "it" to a new name
(actually saving interactions, but I think
I'm saving the definitions).
4) notice that def'ns window didn't have 
changed path.
5) Change focus to def'n.s window, use C-x C-w
to save file *with same new path*.
6) run Again.
7) Close the window. You will be prompted:
"Wait, you forgot to save! Don't you want to save?"
(paraphrased) When you click on "yes", you're
actually destroying the file by overwriting it
with the contents of the interactions window.
Ouch!

 What if we made c-x c-w in the interactions window save the
 definitions window instead?

 Yes, that would completely solve the problem for me.
