>Description:
When compiling with GCC 4.9 ("gcc (GCC) 4.9.0 20130519 (experimental)"), there is a warning during the xsrc part of the build:

../../../racket/gc2/../src/list.c: In function ‘hash_table_clear_bang’:
../../../racket/gc2/../src/list.c:2444:9: warning: array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
       a[2] = i;
         ^
I am using a parallel build, but I think the compile line being used is:

gcc -I./.. -I../../../racket/gc2/../include -g -O2 -pthread -I/usr/lib64/libffi-3.0.5/include        -Wall    -c xsrc/list.c -o list.o

Looking at the source file (racket/src/racket/src/list.c), the array access is definitely out-of-bounds (the array a has only two elements).
>How-To-Repeat:
Check out current Git version of Racket, and try to build it (-Wall appears to be on by default); you might need a newer GCC version, but I am not sure.  Inspection of the source code will find the bug as well.

 Thanks! I forgot to write relevant tests, and that code is not even
 close to right.
