>Description:
The documentation of key-event% (http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/keymap_.html#%28meth._%28%28%28lib._mred%2Fmain..rkt%29._keymap~25%29._handle-key-event%29%29) says "returning #t if the event was handled (i.e., a handler was found and it returned a true value), #f otherwise." The docs for call-function say "If the function cannot be found or the found handler did not want to handle the event, #f is returned. Otherwise, the return value is the boolean return value of the event handler." The docs of add-function say "The return value is of the procedure is ignored.", which seems contradictory. At any rate, the repro code shows that call-function and handle-key-event ignore the handler's return value and always return #t if the key is mapped.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require racket/gui/base)
(define km (new keymap%))
(send km add-function "func" (const #f))
(send km map-function "f" "func")
(define ke (new key-event% [key-code #\f]))

; next two lines each return #t but should return #f
(send km handle-key-event (void) ke)
(send km call-function "func" (void) ke)
