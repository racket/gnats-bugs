Not really something we can do via the PR system.

 We have spent a significant effort trying to keep the memory use down
 of DrRacket and hope to keep doing this in the future, but unless
 you've spotted a specific leak, I'm sorry to say that this PR is not
 really going to help us in our quest so I've closed it.
 
 Thanks for your interest in Racket.
