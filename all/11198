>Description:
Hitting ctrl-U switches to language defined in source switches to the language menu, but hitting ctrl-C is rather more ambiguous.
>How-To-Repeat:
Have buffer reading 
#lang racket
while in "language from source" mode.  Go to the language menu.  Hit ctrl-C.  But radio button moves to "Choose a language" mode.  Hit enter.  The menu goes away, and you're still in language-from-source mode.

(If after hitting ctrl-C you try navigating by keyboard, no cigar.)
