>Description:
I have a .plt file, and double-click on it (actually from Chrome). DrRacket comes up and asks if I want to open or install. I click on install. It installs, but when it's done, the "Installer Progress" window is sort of dead:

- all buttons (including Close) are greyed out
- there's no kill button in the window's chrome
- Command-w doesn't close it (on OS X)
