>Description:
I've looked through the code of enum.rkt and generate-term.rkt and found that this should raise an error to the effect of "this is currently unimplemented" but instead it raises an error that a term it should have ruled out doesn't match.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require redex)

(define-language L
  [e x (e e ...) (lambda (x_!_ ...) e)]
  [x variable-not-otherwise-mentioned])

(redex-check L e_chk (redex-match? L e (term e_chk)))
;; redex-check: (lambda (a a) a) does not match e_chk

Reason>>> 

This bug was fixed in late July in the git version of Racket. It has 
not made it to a release yet.

I believe I also closed the github issue you commented on with the 
same comment.
