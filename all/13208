>Description:
On my Windows machine, copying an image from Chrome (Version 22.0.1229.94 m) and pasting it into DrRacket appears to be slicing off a few of the rightmost columns of pixels and placing them at the left.  I know this might be a Chrome bug instead, but pasting the image into other applications works fine so I'm reporting this to you guys anyway.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a page with images in Chrome.  Right-click and copy an image.  Paste into DrRacket -- Interactions or Defs window, doesn't matter.
>Fix:
