 I suspect the problem is that the (define-datatype type ...)

 that this was no longer allowed.
 

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Mon, 06 Feb 2012 10:31:00 -0500
Reason>>> The `code.tar' file contains code for an older version of
EOPL, which does not work with the current version of the
EOPL language in Racket.  Please use the code associated
with the latest edition of EOPL, found here:
http://www.eopl3.com/code.html
