>Description:
drracket gives an error message and fails to load. I've tried installing from http://download.racket-lang.org/installers/5.3.4/racket/racket-5.3.4-bin-x86_64-linux-debian-squeeze.sh , from the package in the Arch repository, and from source. The result in every case is the same:


[me@computer ~]$ drracket

 given: #f

     the set-loaded-mask method in

 blaming: 
      <collects>/drracket/private/frame-icon.rkt

I'm running Arch Linux on an Intel 64-bit system with an nVidia G75V. Previous versions have worked fine on my machine.

Borrowing some lines from collects/drracket/private/frame-icon.rkt gives the following result in gracket:

However:

It appears at least one other person has had this problem: http://racket-lang.org/irc-logs/20130508.txt

 The previous person who had this problem had a problem with the libpng
 installation, I believe.

 Oh, yes: sorry about that.Here's the earlier PR:
 
 http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=13741
 
 (I'll try to improve DrRacket too, so that it doesn't crash in this
 unhelpful way when it can't load some of these pngs. But if this is really
 the same problem, then things will be a bit crippled until the lower-level
 problem is resolved.)

 Just in case you didn't get this from the trail on the other PR, apparently
 libpng12 needs to be installed and the arch linux package is not quite
 right (not having the right dependencies, I gather).
 
 I'll push something that does a better job coping with bogus images in the
 splash screen code, but I don't really know how much further that's going
 to get you.
