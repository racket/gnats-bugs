 This looks like your preferences have gotten out of sync (we have had
 other reports of this behavior, but have not been able to figure out
 how people get their preferences into this state).
 
 Assuming I've got the issue correct, the way to fix it is to open the
 language dialog, go to the module language settings, make sure the
 details are shown (hit the 'show details' button if it is there,
 otherwise the button says 'hide details' and you're set) and then
 click the 'add default' button in the 'collection paths' section.
 
 Do let me know if that doesn't work and if you know how you got into
 that state, then please let me know so I can make sure to avoid that
 for others.
 
 thanks,
 Robby
