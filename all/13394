>Description:
The currently advertised 5.3.1 does not have this problem, however it is consistent on 5.3.1.9 and 5.3.1.10.  I send numbers out, one line each, and around 25,000 numbers, CPU stays at 100% and the Dr. Racket GUI essentially freezes, although menus are eventually attainable at which point the CPU use drops.  As soon as the main window loop starts again, CPU use returns to 100%.  The same symptom is experienced under Windows 64 bit (Windows 7).
>How-To-Repeat:
3 times in interaction window:

(for ((a 10000))
  (printf "~a\n" a))

 Further information - Logging shows endless
 
 framework/colorer: starting to color
 framework/colorer: coloring stopped with more to do
 framework/colorer: starting end-edit-sequence
 framework/colorer: finished end-edit-sequence
 
 There is no log to "updated observers" because finished? (in colorer-driver) is not finished.
 
 It looks as though colorer-driver starts its lexical scan all over from the top rather than picking up where it left off at the last attempt.  Thus, when the size of the interaction output is big enough to not finish once, it never finishes.
 
 color.rkt : 374 looks suspicious in that I believe start-time is carrying the original (current-inexact-milliseconds).  This 
 would cause re-tokenize-move-to-next-ls to always be past the check for 20 milliseconds if I read this correctly.

 I don't think you're reading that correctly. That number will always be the
 time that the current callback started, which is the right thing, I
 believe. And I believe the colorer always starts from the latest insertion
 point. But both of these are easy to check if you just add some printfs.
 
 Worse, tho, I'm not seeing the bad behavior you are. Is there possibly
 something else about your configuration? Perhaps try moving your
 preferences file out of the way and restarting DrRacket? (You can move it
 back to restore your prefs, but do it when DrRacket is closed).

 Actually one thought: how fast is your machine?
 
 Do things get better if you you change the 20.0 on line 322 in color.rkt to
 100.0?
