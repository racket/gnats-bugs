>Description:
I think the pagination and display of search results in help desk is a little annoying with only 20 results. Here are some observations:

When exploring available functions it is nice to be able to skim results instantly. It's not obvious enough that there are more pages.

I think people are used to seeing a page count in the footer like in google results. The "Showing 1-20 (9 exact) of 35 matches" thing under the search bar is not well positioned bc. ones eyes will instantly focus on the results. It's also hard to parse quickly the way it's written.

The "buttons" to get to the next page are too small and two > characters without the word "Next" to them are needlessly hard to click.

"Next >" in bold and possibly underlined would help here.

Result pages do not get less important with greater page numbers.
Example: searching for apply has keyword-apply on the second page but more arcane apply's on the first. Showing more per page might mitigate that problem in general.

Maybe showing a page count in the footer and something around 40 results is worth considering (increasing the value of results in the search mask is futile since I (and likely others) use many tabs with racket docs and it's not persistent).

What do you think?
