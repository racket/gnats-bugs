You get an error like this:

 I don't see why this is a problem with "raco pkg". It seems to be
 totally about "raco setup"... you didn't use the package system to get
 the link and then the error is from "raco setup" (called by the
 package system) trying to see that it is still there.
 
 In any case, what do you expect to happen? I see this has identical to
 deleting random .so in your /usr/lib directory... you shouldn't have
 any expectation of anything working after doing that.

 It's a problem with `raco pkg` because calling `raco pkg` causes the
 problem, and `raco pkg` is a user-facing command.  Maybe the right
 solution is to fix raco setup, but maybe not.  Either way, the package
 system shouldn't fail in this way. If there was a strange bug in
 `add1` when applied to 17, then `length` would need to use `+`
 instead, or fix `add1`, but just saying this is an issue with `add1`
 would be insufficient.

 I expect the installation of the new package to work fine.  On Linux,
 if you delete a random .so file belonging to package A and then
 install unrelated package B, everything will work.
