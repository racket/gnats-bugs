  | simplify and extend the find-string method in text%
  | 
  | This implementation runs about 10% faster than the old when searching
  | for "Î»" in (collection-file-path "unit.rkt" "drracket" "private"). It
  | is copied directly from the search search algorithm from Wikipedia
  | called Knuth-Morris-Pratt, but with a fancier version of get-char that
  | cooperates with text%'s snip interface for more efficient linear
  | scans of characters.
  | 
  | It also generalizes the previous one by supporting searching into
  | embedded text% objects inside editor-snip% objects
