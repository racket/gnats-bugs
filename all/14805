Some combination of my laptop's graphic card/driver and my projector driver seems to be interfering with DrRacket's graphics engine when I plug in or unplug the projector. Frequently DrRacket crashes and must be restarted.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket while not connected to projector.

 This problem should be fixed in the upcoming v6.1.1 release. For now,
 you can try a pre-release candidate from here:
