>Description:
The big-bang system seems to mutate the random number
 generator (probably by calling random) in a way that 
is visible to big-bang programs.  Oddly, this comes up 
when there are keyboard events.

Here is a program that demonstrates the problem:

#lang racket
(require 2htdp/universe 2htdp/image)
(random-seed 1324)
(big-bang 0 
          (on-tick (λ _ (printf "~a " (random 10))) 1)
          (to-draw (λ _ (empty-scene 100 100)))
          (on-key (λ _ 0)))

If you mash on the keys while it runs, then run it again 
and mash again, you'll see a different sequence of numbers 
printed, despite the explicit seeding.

A work around is the following:

#lang racket
(require 2htdp/universe 2htdp/image)
(define r (make-pseudo-random-generator))
(parameterize ((current-pseudo-random-generator r))
  (random-seed 1324))

(big-bang 0 
          (on-tick (λ _ (printf "~a " (random 10 r))) 1)
          (to-draw (λ _ (empty-scene 100 100)))
          (on-key (λ _ 0)))

But I would expect big-bang to do the jumping through hoops to 
maintain its own internal state.

 That is correct. BB's semantics is probabilistic. It actually does not render and display large graphical images every time the clock ticks. I guess I can use the parameterize trick internally to fix this. Thanks. 
 
 (p.s. You really don't want BB expressions in the def window. Define a function.)

 I was just about to do this after I had written a test. I'll add the test in after checking it against your implementation.
