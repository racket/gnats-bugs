The command "planet fileinject sbloch picturing-programs.plt 2 2" used to work under 4.2.x, but now it says

 OK, so I gather the new magic words are "raco planet" rather than just =
 "planet", but that crashes too:
 
 bloch% raco planet fileinject sbloch picturing-programs.plt 2 2
 <collects>/planet/util.rkt:=20
   (file
    /Applications/Racket =
 v5.0.0.1/collects/planet/private/cmdline-tool.rkt)
  broke the contract=20
   (->
    pkg-spec?
    string?
    natural-number/c
    any/c
    (or/c pkg? #f))
  on install-pkg; expected <string?>, given: =
 #<path:/Users/bloch/programming/teachpacks/racket/picturing-programs.plt>
