>Description:
When I try "Continue" tutorial, DrRacket crashes.
>How-To-Repeat:
DrRacket crashed when i do this

1) I open DrRacket and type this:

#lang web-server/insta
(define (start request)
  (response/xexpr
   '(html
     (head (title "My Blog"))
     (body (h1 "Under construction")))))

2) I click "Run" and Internet Explorer appear and everything's fine. But when i close Internet Explorer,
in the REPL pane i get this error:
. . ..\..\Program Files\Racket\collects\racket\port.rkt:1135:4: tcp-read: error reading
  systen error: Unknown error; errno=10054

3) I then click "Stop" and get "Web Server stopped". But then, Racket crashes (sometimes immediately, sometimes after clicking "Start").

 FWIW, I was able to reproduce this on a Windows 7 machine. It only
 happens for me with IE9 set as the default browser. On Opera it was
 fine.

 You got the crash too?
 
 The error message seems to be related to the port being left open
 because it uses HTTP/1.1 and then IE closes the connection. (This
 error, btw, should not be there in the latest release.)
 
 I can't explain the crash though... Asumu, can you get it on the console too?

 Yes, I get the crash too (and I'm running a stock 5.3.1 for Windows). I
 seem to only get the crash if I wait a few seconds after the error to
 press "Stop".
 
 When I run it from cygwin, I get a segmentation fault after the crash
 but no other error messages.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 I think I'm going to need Matthew's opinion on this because I don't
 know what would could be going on.
