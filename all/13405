>Description:
Using the read-html-as-xml to read an HTML file as XML gives unexpected results with entities. For example:

<h3 class='post-title entry-title'>
<a href='http://acuariopolitico.blogspot.com/2010/06/procuradurias-juntas-en-caso-contra.html'>Procuradurías, juntas en caso contra &#8220;Contador&#8221;</a>
</h3>

creates an "a" element whose contents are entity 8220, pcdata "Procuradurías, juntas en caso contra Contador", and entity 8221.

I would expect an "a" element (within the h3 element) whose contents are pcdata "Procuradurías, juntas en caso contra ", entity 8220, pcdata "Contador", and entity 8221.

In other words, the entity 8220 is misplaced.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an HTML file that contains an element with embedded entities, read it as XML, and look at the resulting internal data structures.

 Can you close this for me? It is being read correctly at the
 read-html-as-xml level. I'm pretty sure I am seeing a bug is some of my
 own code that cleans up pcdata for processing.
 
 Thanks,
 Doug
