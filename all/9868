Immediate answer is
** Bad HTML!! Use -trace to diagnose **

 I think that's ok for HTML 4.0, and I think we follow the W3
 recommendation for the subset of tags to use the "/>" notation. (I'm no
 HTML expert, and I'm mostly going by our documentation for the
 libraries that I'm using, so let me know if I'm confused.)
 
 But running `lynx -trace' helpfully explains that the "<input ...>" for
 the search box is not in a "<form ...>". I'll fix that.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 The "/>" notation has been introduced with XML to indicate empty elements.
 It is valid in XHTML, but not in HTML.
 It is basically a well-known hack to write <meta ... /> to get certain 
 HTML browsers
 to parse XHTML. But as you are generating HTML, the closing "/>" is not 
 needed.

 Just to be clear, putting a `form' around `input' fixes the complaint
 from lynx.
 
 We've made that change in SVN, though it won't appear in a normal
 release until the version after the upcoming 4.1.2 release.
