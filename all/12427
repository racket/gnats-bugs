 looks like it was control-c'd to me. I don't understand why 'thd' in
 xref.rkt is killed, but apparently that can happen.

 @Robby
 Yes, I hit Ctr-c, because I've started racket from terminal, and after pressing syntax-check  racket didn't react.
 
 @Sam
 Everything was ok, no error till I pressed syntax-check button.
 
 I've downgraded to 5.1.2, same terminal output, tryied binary version (5.2) from racket site, the same thing. I can reproduce this error on debian 6.0 x64. Looks like linux related problem. Btw, I've notice same errors on win7 with previous version of racket, but since I've upgraded to 5.2 everything is ok.
