>Description:
If I make a program that uses include that runs fine on its own, then symlink to it from another directory, I cannot run that symlink.  The shell script below produces the following error message for me:

link.rkt:1:13: include: can't open include file (open-input-file: cannot open input file
>How-To-Repeat:
#!/bin/bash
mkdir code-for-bug
echo > code-for-bug/lib.rkt
echo '#lang racket (include "lib.rkt")' > code-for-bug/main.rkt
racket code-for-bug/main.rkt
ln -s code-for-bug/main.rkt link.rkt
racket link.rkt
