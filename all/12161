Computer Language: (("Determine language from source") (#(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang racket\n" #f #t))
>Description:
Syntax created from syntax templates in DrRacket's definition buffer no longer has line and column information, although the rest of the source location remains.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program in DrRacket:

#lang racket
(define s #'(a b c))
(list (syntax-position s) (syntax-line s))

It produces '(26 #f), but in previous versions it produced '(26 2).
