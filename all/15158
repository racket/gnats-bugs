>Description:
Doc for (/ z w1 w2 ... ) says: "When no ws are supplied, returns (/ 1 z). Otherwise, returns the division of z by the ws working pairwise from left to right."

I expected that for (/ 12 2 3) this would produce (6 4), which is the quotient of z by each w, working left to right. I believe that this is a reasonable interpretation of the statement given. 

I suggest a rewrite that says "returns the quotient of z by the product of the ws, where an empty product is defined to be 1." This makes it clear that the proc returns one number, and doesn't specify HOW the computation is carried out ("left to right") which should presumably be left to the implementor anyhow.
