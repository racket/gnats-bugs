>Description:
Search returns no results.  In particular, searching for anything using
either help desk or plt-help produces a blank page whose source is 

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

... That's the entire source of the page. Maybe a problem with xml rendering?

CAVEAT: I've been messing with Dmitry Lizorkin's sxml package in my planet
cache... but I'm 98% confident that plt-help's rendering is internal and 
can't possibly be related to this.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) run plt-help
2) In the search box at the top of the page, type 'planet' and hit return.
3) see blank page (with source as specified above).

 `plt-help' is not doing any kind of rendering -- its only job is to
 get you to the relevant start page.

 This works fine for me.  Did you disable javascript by any chance?
