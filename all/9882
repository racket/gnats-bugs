>Description:
In the latest version, consider the following program in beginning student language, with the testing teachpack:

---- Begin program ----

; positive-integer? takes a number and returns true if it is a positive integer, otherwise false.
; positive-integer?: Number(n) -> Boolean

(check-expect (positive-integer? 5) true)
(check-expect (positive-integer? 5.5) false)
(check-expect (positive-integer? -1) false)

(define (positive-integer? n)
  (and (negative? n) (integer? n)) )

(generate-report)

---- End Program ----

Running this program (on both Windows and Mac), yields the following test results:

Ran 6 tests.
4 of the test 6s failed.

  Actual value  differs from , the expected value.
In c:\temp\testexamples.ss at line 5 column 0
  Actual value  differs from , the expected value.
In c:\temp\testexamples.ss at line 7 column 0
  Actual value  differs from , the expected value.
In c:\temp\testexamples.ss at line 5 column 0
  Actual value  differs from , the expected value.
In c:\temp\testexamples.ss at line 7 column 0

There are several problems here.
1.  There are only 3 tests, and 2 failed.  Why the double testing?
2.  Odd syntax "4 of the test 6s failed".
3.  No values are actually given for the actual value and the expected value, making it extremely difficult to use this information to track down the bug.

It does not make a difference whether the tests are before or after the function.

It also is not unique to Booleans.  I have encountered these bizarre testing results with many other types of functions.

 For the latest version of the teachpack, you do not need to and  
 should not call (generate-report).
 
 The syntax of the English is still a serious problem. Time to bring  
 in someone who majored on the other half of the campus :-) (This is  
 an internal joke, and please don't ask for an explanation.)
