>Description:
When you enter the exact thing you would have in the definitions area, but put it into the interactions area, it is instant. Why can't Dr.Racket have a quick compile mode which just enters everything in the definitions area into the interactions area making the program compile instantly?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try entering:

(define prefix "hello")
(define suffix "world")
(string-append prefix "_" suffix)

Once in the definitions area, and once in the interactions area. In interations, it will run instantly, meanwhile you have to wait about 5 seconds to have it compile in the definitions area.
