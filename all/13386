>Description:
It takes raco make over 20 seconds to compile the simplest use of include I can create.  Just running racket on the same program takes under half a second.  The script below gives me the following timing results (racket followed by raco make):

real	0m0.453s
user	0m0.324s
sys	0m0.085s

real	0m22.955s
user	0m20.400s
sys	0m1.777s

This kind of performance is consistent, not a fluke, and in larger programs it scales similarly.  The larger program I started with takes about 90 seconds to compile, but 2-3 seconds to run.

Even more bizarrely, it does not appear to matter whether the .zo files are present or not!  The raco make command is still incredibly slow for already-compiled programs that use include.

 I'm not able to replicate your results, so far. Running your script, I
 get:
 
 real	0m0.343s
 user	0m0.239s
 sys	0m0.061s
 
 real	0m1.262s
 user	0m0.912s
 sys	0m0.160s
 
 That's from Mac OS X, and I get similar results on Linux. Do you get
 the same result on other machines? Is some environment-variable setting
 relevant?

 On Mac OS X, I got the initial results with several environment variables
 set: PLTPLANETDIR, PLTADDONDIR, and PLTCOMPILEDROOTS.  I tried again with
 none of those set and I still get the same behavior.  I'm using the
 downloaded install for Racket 5.3.1, none of this is from git or from
 source.
 
 I tried running on a Linux machine and got the same results you are getting.
 
 I don't know why we are seeing inconsistent results on Mac.  Can you think
 of anything else I should try, in order to figure this out?

 Looks like a non-bug.  My installation got into a weird state where the
 collections were not built right or something.  After a "raco setup",
 everything compiles at regular speeds.  Downloading a completely fresh
 install, everything works properly from the get-go.  I don't know how
 things got screwed up, but it was probably some odd shuffling around of
 settings that I should have run "raco setup" after in the first place.
 Anyway, I'll close the PR.
