>Description:
I was briefly glancing at: http://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html, and I see that some of the images seem to be cut off at the edges.  In particular, the example images for circles, ellipses, outlined squares, etc have their right edge sheared off.

 Were the example images (by any chance) generated on a Windows  
 machine?  There's been a Windows-specific bug for a long time that  
 frequently chopped off the rightmost and bottommost pixels of an image.

 I think I know what is going on with this PR. I'm asking what you
 meant by "There's been a Windows-specific bug for a long time that
 frequently chopped off the rightmost and bottommost pixels of an
 image."
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
 
 PS: I readded bugs, so if we ever have to come back to this, I will
 not have to rely on my (really really poor...) memory.
