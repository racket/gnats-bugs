I'm trying to build racket (from git master) on OpenBSD/sparc64 and Linux/ppc64le. "configure && make", that's all, no extra options.

Both are stuck in:

Linux/ppc64le:
mkdir xsrc
make ../gracket3m
make[5]: Entering directory '/home/juanfra/racket/racket/src/gracket/gc2'
../../racket/racket3m  -cqu ./../../racket/gc2/xform.rkt --setup ../../racket/gc2 --cpp "gcc -E -I./../../racket/gc2 -I./../../racket/ -I./../../racket/include/ -DUSE_SENORA_GC     -Dwx_xt -MMD"  --keep-lines -o xsrc/grmain.c +D INITIAL_COLLECTS_DIRECTORY='"'"`cd ./../../../collects; pwd`"'"' +D INITIAL_CONFIG_DIRECTORY='"'"`cd ./../../..; pwd`/etc"'"' ./../grmain.c

OpenBSD/sparc64:
cd gc2; make 3m
mkdir xsrc
make ../gracket3m
../../racket/racket3m  -cqu ./../../racket/gc2/xform.rkt --setup ../../racket/gc2 --cpp "gcc -E -I./../../racket/gc2 -I./../../racket/ -I./../../racket/include/ -DUSE_SENORA_GC    -pthread -I/usr/local/include -Dwx_xt "  --keep-lines -o xsrc/grmain.c +D INITIAL_COLLECTS_DIRECTORY='"'"`cd ./../../../collects; pwd`"'"' +D INITIAL_CONFIG_DIRECTORY='"'"`cd ./../../..; pwd`/etc"'"' ./../grmain.c

- Download racket from git master
- configure && make

 I think this is the first point in the build that runs racket3m, and
 it's not too surprising that there's a 3m problem on less-common
 architectures.
 
 Are you able to attach to the stuck process via gdb and get a stack
 trace? I expect that it has something to do with the write-barrier
 implementation, but a little more context might help.
