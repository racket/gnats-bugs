I am using the BS language with Teachpack: image.ss.

I am running DrRacket ver 5.3.1 on Mac OS X 10.8.2.

Thank you for any help you can provide.

 To which part of HtDP/2e are you referring? 
 Since this is possibly a problem with the 
 writing and not the functions, could you 
 send me a URL? Thanks. 
 
 (There used to be a presentation bug but that
 was eliminated with the October release. Please

 I think you're using the htdp/image teachpack, not the 2htdp/image
 teachpack. If you're using the GUI to select them, you want to use the
 image teachpack in the middle column, not the in the left column.

 This bug should be closed.  The student's environment shows that they
 are using the teachpack from the deprecated image library:
 
     Computer Language: (("Teaching Languages" "How to Design Programs"
 "Beginning Student with List Abbreviations") (#(#t constructor
 repeating-decimal #f #t none) #f ((lib "image.ss" "teachpack"
 "htdp"))))
 
 
 rather than 2htdp/image.  The overlay function of htdp/image behaves
 differently than that of 2htdp/image.
