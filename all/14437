>Description:
The following program:

#lang racket

(define my/c
  (object/c
   (field foo bar)
   (baz (->m integer? integer?))))

(define/contract my-obj my/c
  (new (class object%
         (super-new)
         (field (foo 0)
                (bar 0))
         (define/public (baz n) n))))

Produces the following contract error:
Racket/DEV/racket/racket/collects/racket/contract/private/misc.rkt:1637:0: contract-projection: contract violation
  expected: contract?
  given: #<just-check-existence>
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to run the following program:

#lang racket

(define my/c
  (object/c
   (field foo bar)
   (baz (->m integer? integer?))))

(define/contract my-obj my/c
  (new (class object%
         (super-new)
         (field (foo 0)
                (bar 0))
         (define/public (baz n) n))))
