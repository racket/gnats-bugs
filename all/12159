>Description:
If I add a DrRacket language level (the old, pre-#lang kind) whose language module requires rackunit/gui, in DrRacket I get the following error message:

namespace-attach-module: a different module with the same name is already in the destination namespace, for name: "$PLTHOME/collects/rackunit/private/gui/drracket-link.rkt"

Even worse, on startup if this is the default language level, DrRacket gets stuck and will not start properly.

I know language levels like this are not the future of DrRacket, but I am trying to move Dracula's testing from SchemeUnit to RackUnit [re: PR 12153] and this is giving me problems.  A workaround would be sufficient, but I haven't found one yet.

 Do you see this problem if you disable all other tools?
 
 I think that maybe this is a problem with a rackunit tool that is
 attaching something (and maybe it shouldn't be). But this is just a
 guess.
 
 Also: why is your language implementation loading your test suite?

 So that tests can be run every time you hit "Run".  I don't know any
 other good way to do it; I don't want to run them once per module.
 
 This is almost certainly related to the RackUnit GUI tool.  Thing is,
 DrRacket-integrated GUIs pretty much need to work that way.  It's the
 same with check-expect.  I'd forgotten the namespace games I copied
 from the student languages to make that work; I'm in the process of
 doing likewise for the RackUnit GUI.  If I get it working I'll close
 this bug.

 The rackunit tool code is mine. I just took another look at it, and I 
 think I can change it to avoid attaching the module, which should avoid 
 the collision.

 That would be the best if it is possible. If not, perhaps there is
 some small thing to attach which Carl can be careful with.

 Changes in the trunk are good, but I need to release this on Planet to
 users of 5.1.3, so I have to go with the workaround for now.  Anyway,
 rackunit/private/gui/drracket-link contains a comment that it has
 minimal dependencies for precisely this reason.  So that gives me a
 natural place to start.

 The rackunit tool tries to attach the rackunit/private/gui/drracket-link 
 module into the user namespace so that rackunit/gui can call functions 
 like show-backtrace. The problem is that your language has already 
 (transitively) required rackunit/private/gui/drracket-link, so the 
 attempt to attach it fails.
 
 The solution is to somehow make sure your language instantiates 
 rackunit/gui after rackunit/tool has attached that module. Maybe use 
 dynamic-require to lazily require racket/gui?

 I am having partial success so far (and I think the remaining problems
 are unrelated) by adding a hook to the language's on-execute method
 that attaches the drracket-link module before any code in the language
 gets run.  That way its requires to racket/gui pick up the correct
 shared version.
