https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/servlet.html#%28def._%28%28lib._web-server%2Fservlet%2Fweb..rkt%29._send%2Fsuspend%29%29

there is a sentence that says "Captures the current continuation, stores it with exp as the expiration handler, and binds it to a URL.", but 'exp' is here hyperlinked to 

https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._exp%29%29

which I guess is wrong, and I am curious what it should be.

 It should have said "(current-servlet-continuation-expiration-handler)".
 Thanks for the catch.
