>Description:
The current snapshot 6.1.0.8--2014-09-11(dcfe7ed/a) fails to execute the (factorial 100000) program, eating up all memory on my 8G laptop and eventually getting killed by the system (Ubuntu 14.04 64bit).

Racket release 6.1 runs this program fine and finishes after ~8 seconds.

The last few lines of the error message looks like below (The entire message is similar, just with different addresses):
