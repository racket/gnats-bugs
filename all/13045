When I run the new release of drracket on my ubuntu 11.04 (natty) notebook, it seems to come up and work, but it barfs out a bunch of lines to stdout/stderr of the form
/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/menuproxies/libappmenu.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

I'm worried about this worrying my students when classes start in two weeks...

 If I'm reading this bug report correctly, it looks like an Ubuntu
 packaging problem:
 
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/appmenu-gtk/+bug/783073
 
 According to the bug info, you're running a 32-bit Racket on a 64-bit
 Linux installation. If I understand correctly, running a 64-bit Racket
 would likely avoid the packaging problem.

 I am indeed running a 32-bit racket on a 64-bit machine. It was the natural
 thing to do: I went to racket-lang.org, clicked on download, selected the only
 ubuntu option offered, "Linux i386 (Ubuntu karmic)" and that's what I got.
 
 So, I'm inferring from your reply that I would have been better off getting the
     Linux x86_64 (Debian squeeze)
 version -- that is, preferring a perfect match of the architecture to a perfect
 match on the OS.
 
 There's a lot of Ubuntu out there. And I think the x86_64 platform is now much
 more common than 32b x86. So I'm thinking y'all should probably put up an x86_64
 Ubuntu package.
 
 I'm off to switch to the Debian 64b version now. Thanks.

 Sure enough, installing the Debian x86_64 racket cleared up the issue.
 
 I would still maintain, however, that this is a bug in the selection mechanism
 provided by the website.
