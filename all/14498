When a new window is opened, the top two items (increase/decrease font size) and the penultimate one (Show column width guide) are blank in the View menu.
Clicking in an edit pane or switching between windows makes the text appear.

Opening a new tab works fine.

This happens on OS X Mavericks 10.9.2.

Open a new window in DrRacket and look in the View menu without having clicked anywhere.

 I'm guessing that the source of the problem here is that the focus is
 not being set to the definitions window when you first open the window
 (since the menu items are guarded by a check for that). When you make
 a new window and start typing, where do the characters go?
 
 Also, I'm not able to make this happen myself (under mac os x 9.2).

 Thanks. It probably is a real bug, but just harder to diagnose and fix
 than we might have hoped. :(
