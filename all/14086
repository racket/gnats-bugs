>Description:
I'm encountering a failing test case, which when traced with the stepper, shows a value created with 'make-editor' passed to a function and given a name.  Then when the name is used inside the function, it has turned into a value created with 'make-signature'.

The problem goes beyond the stepper; the test case fails even when the stepper is not used.

The program is the solution to a homework assignment (the graphical editor with lists, from the second edition), so I prefer not to post it on my web site.  I will try the racket web site or if all else fails, will email it to the racket bugs list.

I'm quite willing to believe I'm doing something wrong---the message 'no signature violations' seems ominous---but I'm having trouble making sense of what I'm seeing.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Load program that I will provide
2. Click 'Run'
3. Observe the following test output:


Ran 7 tests.
1 of the 7 tests failed.

No signature violations.

Check failures:
	check-expect encountered the following error instead of the expected value, .. 
   :: editor-left: expects an editor, given (make-signature ...)

 The error was between the keyboard and the chair.
 Please close this ticket.

 Norman, this is a bug in BSL that I don't know how to repair (easily). 
 
 As I may have mentioned, ISL and up come with 'checked signatures' that is
 a language of signature specification and mechanism that checks all signatures. 
 [[ They are not contracts checked at boundaries but literally run-time 
 assertions checked everywhere, all the time. ]] 
 
 To make this work, structs have to come with a linguistic signature counterpart. 
 That's the only thing that is enabled in BSL and on occasion people stumble 
 across this thing, like you did with your test case. 
 
 Apologies.
