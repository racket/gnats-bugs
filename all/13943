>How-To-Repeat:

Insert -> Insert Comment Box. Cursor is invisible.

  | set the background and the foreground color (not just the foreground)
  | when switching to white-on-black mode (or back).
  | 
  | this causes the cursor in embedded editors to pick up the right colors
  | (since it is selected by the inverse of the background color of the style
  | of the enclosing editor snip)
  | 
  | closes PR 13943
