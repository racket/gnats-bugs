>Description:
In the trivial webserver below, send/formlet has a #:wrap keyword, which generates an xexpr which includes a cdata struct.  This seems to disrupt send/formlet, with the effect that it produces no content at or after the CDATA.

No error is produced.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang web-server
(require web-server/servlet-env
         web-server/formlets
         web-server/formlets/servlet
         (only-in xml cdata))

(define (start req)
  (start
   (send/formlet
    (formlet
     (div
      "Month:" ,{input-int . => . month}
      "Day:" ,{input-int . => . day}
      (input ((type "submit") (name "Go") (value "Update"))))
     (list month day))
    #:wrap (lambda (body)
             `(html (head (title "Form with CDATA"))
                    (body (p "Hello, this is a form")
                          (p ,(cdata 'cdata-start 'cdata-end "<![CDATA[foo]]>"))
                          ,body))))))

(serve/servlet start #:stateless? #t)
