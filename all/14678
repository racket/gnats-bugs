>Description:
I've been working on a simple virtual machine in Racket, and it has worked a treat, save that I've run into a small snag in my error handling. I want to spit out an address code in hex. Racket apparently doesn't.

The error is in the (num->hex num) function here: https://github.com/jarcane/MicroMini/blob/49e4b684feaee39a49b6e3e112de144d24c5f877/main.rkt

(format "~x") won't seem to actually convert the number, just spits out a decimal. It works fine in the REPL, it just doesn't work when called inside my program for no apparent reason. ~b and ~o work fine, just not ~x.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you clone the repo, run the badinstruction.mmbin with it:

racket main.rkt badinstruction.mmbin

I've been unable to replicate the bug anywhere else but within the program.

 Please disregard. This turned out to be a user error in the set up and
 operation of the program I used to make the binary files. After a few
 adjustments, it works wonderfully.
