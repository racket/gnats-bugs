>Description:
Recently OpenBSD updated libjpeg to the last version (9 http://www.infai.org/jpeg/ ). Racket says: jpeg "unsupported library version: 90".
>How-To-Repeat:
I added "90" to the file  /usr/local/lib/racket/collects/racket/draw/unsafe/jpeg.rkt:
(unless (member JPEG_LIB_VERSION '(62 64 70 80 90))
  (error 'jpeg "unsupported library version: ~e" JPEG_LIB_VERSION))


Now drracket shows this error:
Error invoking tool #<path:/usr/local/lib/racket/collects/stepper>;("stepper+xml-tool.rkt")

xml-box: bitmap scheme-box.jpg failed to load
channel-put: contract violation
  expected: channel?
  given: #f


Also I did the same change to the source code and compiled racket. Here is other error:
raco setup: error running: (lib images/scribblings/images.scrbl)
jpeg: JPEG parameter struct mismatch: library thinks size is 664, caller expects 656


Let me know of you need more info or whatever.
