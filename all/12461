 I'm not able to replicate this problem on a 32-bit Windows XP VM. I can
 try on a 64-bit Windows 7 machine next week; any ideas meanwhile?

 I see it (in the context of DrRacket) on a mac and under a 32 bit
 windows 7. The code below is the result of my attempt to make a small
 program to understand what was going on.
 
 Does that keybinding work for you in DrRacket?

 Yes. I think I use "ESC;<" and "ESC;>" frequently.

 I definitely use them frequently and frequently have ">" and "<"

 Well, just to double check, I ran it in a file from a Racket.exe
 command-line and I see control-j working, but esc;> not working.
 
 And below is what showkey shows me for esc and then >.
 
 .... aha! It doesn't work with the right-hand shift, but it does with
 the left-hand one.
