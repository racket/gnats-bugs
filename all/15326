>Description:
Behold the below.  It displays this in the bottom pane:

--------------------
FAILURE
actual:     #hash((a . b))
expected:   #hash((a . b))
name:       check-equal?
location:   (unsaved-editor 5 2 112 18)
expression: (check-equal? h i)

. Check failure
--------------------
> 

I spent a _lot_ of time staring at the "actual" and "expected", trying to see how they differed (hint: their printed representations don't differ at all).  Eventually I figured out that one hash was mutable wheras the other wasn't, and that is why they didn't compare as equal.  

It'd sure be nice if check-equal? could have somehow drawn my attention to that distinction.
>How-To-Repeat:
; plop this in drracket, and run it.

#lang racket

(require rackunit)

(let ([h (make-hash '((a . b)))]
      [i (make-immutable-hash '((a . b)))])
  (check-equal? h i))
