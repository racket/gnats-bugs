 How about we change the contract to say "broke its contract" instead
 of "self-contract violation"? Would that help clarify?
 
 Meanwhile, are you also asking for a kind of dissection of the
 contract error messages somewhere?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I was looking for a precise description of what "self contract violation" meant,
 but nothing turned up in the search.
 
 So, yes, I think I am asking for a dissection.

 Will do. In the meantime, what it means is that the module where the
 contract is located is the same as the one that was blamed.
