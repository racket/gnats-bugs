>Description:
The Racket documentation states that there should be a "Enable keybindings in menus" option in the General tab of the preferences window. Disabling it makes some Emacs keybindings, like C-e, map to editing commands instead of menu items.

This option is not present, or at least not visible, in Dr Racket 6.2, at least not that I can see.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open "Preferences" then click the "General" tab.

 It's actually in the general sub-panel of the editing panel. Can you
 point me to the place where you saw the wrong thing written in the
 docs, please?
 
 Thanks,

 It seems that I have misread the docs. I was reading
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/prefs-explanation.html , and I
 found the description via a Google search followed by "find in page". I
 hadn't noticed that there was a second "General" panel under "Editing",
 and I didn't see the part of the docs page where it pointed this out.
 
 Sorry for the false alarm. I should have read more carefully.

 I've changed the name of that subpanel to avoid similar confusion in
 the future. Thanks for the report!
