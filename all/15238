When using the racket command line repl with xrepl, it fails to open terminal editors like vim because the input is not a terminal input.

$ racket

Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
;; Vim is unusable, broken.

It seems the problem is really related to readline:

$ racket
> (terminal-port? (current-input-port))
#t
> (system* (find-executable-path "vim"))
;; All good here!

> (require readline)
> (terminal-port? (current-input-port))
#f
> (system* (find-executable-path "vim"))
Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
;; All broken

Maybe this is a readline bug - i.e. if we expect (current-input-port) to conform be "terminal-port?"

 As sad as it makes me to say that, I think this is actually expected
 behavior. (At the moment anyway).
 
 Because EDITOR just takes the input of standard input, which doesn't
 work the moment readline in enabled.
 
 Perhaps xrepl should capture standard in before creating a readline
 input port so that text editors that are command line based work
 properly?
