 The `contract-out` form is actually a "provide transformer"[1] and is
 provided by and documented with the `racket/contract` library.
 Generally, such extension macros are documented with their providing
 library.
 
 Perhaps the Guide section on module exports should allude to this. In
 any case, I will go ahead and close this bug.
