>Description:
plai-datatype can *almost* rename new data types, including predicates, but it doesn't recognize the reference to a type in a type-case expression
>How-To-Repeat:
Take the program below and hover over name1, and select "rename" to name2.  The type-case expression is not updated.

#lang racket

(require plai/datatype)

(define-type name1
  [complex (n name1?)]
  [simple])

(name1? 3)

(type-case name1 (complex (simple))
  [simple () 7]
  [complex (n) 11])

Reason>>> I just pushed a fix for this and a related problem (with the variants). 
Thanks!
