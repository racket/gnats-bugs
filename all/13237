>Description:
In DrRacket, even though the program background checks and runs (with ctrl-R) just fine:
- hovering the mouse cursor over the name of a module require'd via a planet development link, highlights the module name in red, indicating nothing is used from that module
- defines provided from that module are not connected with "bind" arrows to the require.
>How-To-Repeat:
Noticed after:
- creating planet development link with raco planet link
- creating main.rkt to require and provide all-from-out from foo.rkt
- switching require in test program from (require x/foo) (i.e. found via a PLTCOLLECTS reference) to (require (planet user-x/lib-y))
