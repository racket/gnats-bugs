>Description:
This is probably reported in other places, but anyway -- I think that
the error display handler should not depend on a locally-set error
output, otherwise you can get confusing interactions like:

  > (list 1 (foo) 2)
  > 

when `foo' is something like

  (define (foo)
    (parameterize ([current-error-port (open-output-nowhere)])
      (/ 1 0)))

Another way to see this -- I think that it is wrong for this program
to leave the error message in the file:

  (with-output-to-file "/tmp/foo" #:exists 'append
    (lambda ()
      (parameterize ([current-error-port (current-output-port)])
        (/ 1 0))))

Reason>>> A commit by eli@racket-lang.org was marked as relevant
  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/a2122418ae
  | Fix a use of `fresh-line'.
  | 
  | Needs to do it when the relevant stderr is in effect.
  | 
  | Fixes PR 13744, except that something like this is still bad:
  | 
  |   (with-output-to-file "/tmp/foo" #:exists 'append
  |     (lambda ()
  |       (parameterize ([current-error-port (current-output-port)])
  |         (/ 1 0))))
  | 
  | But I think that it's a bad idea for the error display handler to be
  | called with the locally set port -- described in PR 13974.
