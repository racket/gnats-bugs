>Description:
Using raco to remove a planet package at the command line yields an error message resulting from an attempt to apply (#f 'scribblings).  Otherwise the removal completes successfully; the package and associated documentation are indeed removed from the system.

I've reproduced this on multiple packages.  I've also reproduced this both when the package to be removed is the only one installed and when there are several other packages installed.
>How-To-Repeat:
At the shell prompt:
$ raco planet install cobbe bcond.plt 1 0
## install messages go by
$ raco planet remove cobbe bcond.plt 1 0
## watch for error message:
##  procedure application: expected procedure, given: #f; arguments were: 'scribblings

 Did you get a stacktrace?

 No, unfortunately.  I can, however, provide raco's output; hopefully placin=

 Perhaps you (Robby) recall this already, but I mentioned having this =
 problem at OOPSLA, and Matthew commented that it was probably an issue =
 with setup using #f as the function that pulls the field from the =
 info.rkt file; that in this case, it was trying to extract the =
 scribblings field of the info.rkt file and running into trouble. =20
 
 Apologies if this was already obvious.

 Yeah, that was it. It should have been obvious from the initial PR,
 but it wasn't until your and Richard's follow up messages.
 
 Anyways, fixed now.
 
 Thanks,
