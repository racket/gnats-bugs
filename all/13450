 Typed Racket just ignores submodules -- they get automatically handled
 by the `#%module-begin` appropriate to the submodule.

 I honestly don't know if it makes sense.
 
 Should the submodule be translated also? Or should I just leave it in
 place and let the normal expander do its thing?
 
 [Sam:] Is that what typed Racket does? How does Typed Racket manage to
 check the bodies of the submodules if it actually does?

 Okay, I think I could do that easily then. I was hoping it would be like that.
 
 In the case of #lang web-server, that will probably work because the
 calling conventions are the same.
