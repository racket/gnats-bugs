>Description:
From a mail I sent to the list in July, just filing to make sure this doesn't get lost:

#lang racket
(syntax? (cdr (syntax-e #'(2 . ()))))

If I just run the program with 'racket' I get #t. If I compile it with
'raco make' and run it again I get #f.

Matthew's response:
I agree that the answer should be #t and serialization to bytecode is
wrong to change the result. I'll look into the problem sometime soon.

 Commit 8f20264a83 was meant to repair this problem, and I get #t in
 both cases on my machine. Is it misbehaving for you with the latest?

 I hadn't tested it, I just never saw followup on the original message,
 and I wanted to refer to the issue on a github pull request so made a
 bug.
