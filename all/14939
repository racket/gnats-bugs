>Description:
When I print a tab from DrRacket, the default value in the Number of Copies box is often greater than 1. I can't figure out a pattern for when this happens, as sometimes it does just try to print one copy. I've seen many different numbers appear for the number of copies to print (44, 73, 9999, 9150 and others)
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, I can't give any steps to reliably reproduce. I've been holding off on reporting this for ages hoping that I'd figure out an exact list of steps that reproduces this bug. It often happens when I have multiple tabs open.
