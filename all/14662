>Description:
In delete-directory part[1] of The Racket Reference, it said:

> Deletes an existing directory with the path path. If the directory is not deleted successfully, the exn:fail:filesystem exception is raised.

However, the function only works for empty directory:

$ mkdir -p /tmp/not-empty/subdir
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v6.0.1.
-> (delete-directory "/tmp/not-empty")
; delete-directory: cannot delete directory
;   path: /tmp/not-empty
;   system error: Directory not empty; errno=39
; [,bt for context]

Would it be better if we supply some short word such as "Deletes an existing _empty_ directory with the path ..." to clarify its use?
