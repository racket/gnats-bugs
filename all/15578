>Description:
Dr Racket scrolling is very laggy on my machine. I think it's due to the resolution of my monitor because when I plug it in to a lower resolution external monitor, scrolling works perfectly. If there's any other info you need, feel free to email me.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open Dr Racket on a medium-large size file
2. Scroll

Conditions:
Dr Racket version 7.1
macOS v10.14.3
>Fix:
