>Description:
In the DrRacket documentation, section 1.5 (Tabbed Editing), it states:

1) "in the General sub-pane of the Editing pane in the preferences window, a
   checkbox labelled Open files in separate tabs..."

   This is incorrect.  This checkbox is located in the top-level General pane,
   and NOT within the top-level Editing pane.

2) It is also stated that "On Mac OS X, Command-Shift-Left and
   Command-Shift-Right also move between tabs."

   This does not appear to be the case.  Command-Shift-Left/Right just highlight
   text horizontally, for me.
