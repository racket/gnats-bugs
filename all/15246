>Description:
So, I am trying to test my program on Mac which keeps failing on multiple attempts to run the code. I have a 800-line program, which, when I run after freshly opening racket, works great. My program is a animation program using 2htdp/universe, which uses big-bang to generate ticks and respond to mouse and key events. However, the program doesn't run if I choose a tick-speed of 0.1 seconds or less.
Secondly, if I choose to run at seconds-per-tick setting of 0.2, 0.5 or 1 or higher, it does work fine. But then, in this case, it works fine when I execute it once or twice. When I stop the program and run it the third time, say after making some changes to the code, this time the code runs and displays the scene, however, it does not respond to keyboard or mouse events anymore and the scene is stuck. To Run the program again, I have to close the file, quit Racket and then run it. Running the same program after restarting Racket works just fine. I somehow feel its some memory issue as I have to restart Racket to make my programs run.

DrRacket, version 6.3 [3m].
Language: Beginning Student; memory limit: 512 MB.

I am not able to test my programs or work. It seems that my Windows friends never had any such issue. Am yet to run my code on a Windows machine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a large program in Racket, preferably using 2htdp/universe, run it once and provide key/mouse events on the scene generated from the program. 
Stop it and run for a different seconds-per-frame, again provide key/mouse events on the scene generated from the program.
Stop it and try to run the program the third time, this time, the program is hung and does not respond to mouse/key events and neither does the animation work.

The problem persists even when I use memory limit: 128, 256 or 512.
