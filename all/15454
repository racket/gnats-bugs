>Description:
DrRacket on MacOS maps the Command-\ key to the lambda character. Unfortunately, I have that bound to something else at the system level.  This binding is intercepting the keystroke before it reachers DrRacket. So, I have no convenient way to type the lambda character, save five keystrokes and (most importantly) feel like one of the "cool Lispy kids". It would be very nice to be able to choose the keybindings, at least for things that aren't system standard (like cut, paste, etc.). 

For my specific purposes, even the choice of which modifier key(s) to accompany "\" would be helpful.

Thanks for your consideration and for the great program.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Have another program that always runs in background set to use Command-\ as a shortcut (in my case, it's the Clipboard chooser for LaunchBar). 
2. Type Command-\ in DrRacket, hoping to see lambda character.
3. Have LaunchBar's Clipboard choose appear, rather than lamdba.
4. Be sad.

 Did you see this part of the DrRacket manual?
