the third row from the end, 
(run-tests file-tests)

Should it be "run-test" instead of "run-tests"? I've tried it on my own computer.

 Both `run-test` and `run-tests` exist. They're different functions.
 
 Given the context (i.e., requiring `rackunit/text-ui`), I'm fairly
 confident that `run-tests` is what's intended.
 
 Thanks for having a close look! I'm going to close this.
