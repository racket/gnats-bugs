OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) is currently in Golden Master 3.0 version. I had reported this error to Apple since Beta 2 version but I have not received any fix. I thought it could be related to the DrRacket itself instead of Yosemite. Do you plan to release a compatible version for Yosemite?

Just opening DrRacket. It doesn't launch.

 Hi,
 
 We've fixed the problem for the next release, which will be out a few
 weeks. For now, you can get a working pre-release build from one of the
 sites listed at
 
  http://pre.racket-lang.org/
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew
