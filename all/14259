>Description:
The attached program, when compiled then run, gives the following error

examples/compiled/test-ill-formed_rkt.zo::476: read (compiled): ill-formed code [../../../racket/gc2/../
src/validate.c:1441]                                                                                  
  context...:
   standard-module-name-resolver

When run without compiling ahead of time, the program runs as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run raco make, then run the following program:

#lang racket

(require racket/unsafe/ops)

(define (test)
  (define n (unsafe-fxmax (length '()) 1))
  (values (lambda _ n)))

(test)

 Here's a slightly larger example (reduced from the same original
 program) that still fails.

 #lang racket
 
 (require racket/unsafe/ops)
 
 ;; AFAICT dummy1 can be any function that can't be inlined and calls a function
 ;; it gets as an argument (original example had `build-list' with n = 1)
 (define dummy1 (if (> (random) 0.5) (lambda (x) (x)) (lambda (x) (x))))
 
 ;; AFAICT dummy2 can be any function that can't be inlined (original example had
 ;; `sample' from math/distributions.
 (define dummy2 (if (> (random) 0.5) (lambda (x) x) (lambda (x) x)))
 
 (define (run)
   (define n (unsafe-fxmax (length '()) 1))
   ;; AFAICT the lambda needs to have a rest arg
   (dummy1 (lambda _ (dummy2 n))))
 
 (run)
