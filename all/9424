>Description:
It would be nice to explain the unicode categories, maybe even a
textual explanation of the unions.

(Also, The documentation for unicode categories (the text on the
right of the category in the grammar) has the category names in
text font instead of litchar.  As a result Ll looks confusing
(the text mention of it looks more like L1).)
