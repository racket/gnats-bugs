>Description:
In DrRacket, when launching the "Configure Search" dialog from the "Search in Files" menu item, please auto select-all the contents of the "Search String" field.
When starting a new search the first thing one normally does is to to remove the contents of the previous search. This is reflected when searching within the same file with "edit" -> "find".

 I've pushed a fix, but if you don't/can't get that, then the
 select-all menu shortcut should be working (control-a or command-a,
 depending on your platform).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
