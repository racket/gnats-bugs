>Description:
While reading the official documentation you have:

An input port produces bytes, while an output port produces bytes (and some ports are both input ports and output ports). 

It should be 

An input port consumes bytes, while an output port produces bytes (and some ports are both input ports and output ports). 

see html page:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ports.html

The local documentation in racket downlaod is the same.

 From the perspective of the program, the input port is a source of data and in our terminology sources produce data. Dually, an output port is a sink for data (to the outside world) and sinks consume data. Since read and write are matching procedures, you can also see it like this: (read) produces data from stdio and (write x) consumes x (and transports it to stdout).

 Just for the record, this is related to PR 13756. Although Nick
 suggested flipping the other "produces".
