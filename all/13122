>Description:
When you are installing a .plt, there are two buttons:

[Abort Installation] <greyed out [Close] >

When it's done, the only thing that happens is that [Close] ceases to be grey.  It doesn't indicate that installation was successful, and the most prominent option is still abort.  The raco window text above is also just sort of random output, nothing indicating success.

"Close" sounds weak: I can't tell whether I'm *done* or not.  It describes the window, not the act of installation.  Perhaps something like "Finish", which suggests to the user that DrRacket is actually done.  "Finish" has a positive emotional meaning.  Windows installers do this as a way of saying "installation is done successfully".

I don't know what the Abort button does after completion.  Does it uninstall?  If so it should maybe change to being "Uninstall".

More generally, I would suggest avoiding the word "Abort", both for its emotional weight and because it doesn't make clear what will or own't happen.  Depending on the meaning, "Halt"/"Stop", "Undo"/"Uninstall", etc. are probably all better.  (But I'm guessing it's not a true Undo because changes to individual files will persist?  Or does it make copies?)

 FWIW, the "abort" button used to get grayed when it was successful in
 the past.  (And given that, I think that it's a fine label for it...)

 I did most of this, but I didn't change the label of the "Abort"
 button, because it really does mean "Abort". So now it just gets
 disabled when there is nothing to abort. Please feel free to re-open
 if the changes I made aren't what was intended.
