>Description:
In the documentation for the 'db' module at 
http://docs.racket-lang.org/db/introduction.html

Towards the end of section 1.1 the example for bind-prepared-statement expects the second parameter to be a list. However, the sample display taking just one paramter which results in error when actually running the code. Here is the sample drracket session with the error message when running the given sample in the documentation.

> (define get-less-than-pst
    (prepare pgc "select n from the_numbers where n < $1"))

> (query-list pgc get-less-than-pst 1)
'(0)
> (query-list pgc (bind-prepared-statement get-less-than-pst 2))
. . bind-prepared-statement: contract violation, expected: list?, given: 2
  contract from: <collects>/db/base.rkt, blaming: anonymous-module
  contract: 
    (-> prepared-statement? list? any)
  at: <collects>/db/base.rkt:125.2
> 
>How-To-Repeat:
use the sample code as outlined in the description.
