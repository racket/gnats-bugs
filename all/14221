>Description:
On a system which has had multiple Racket snapshot builds
installed, I have issues running `raco pkg` when zo files
for info.rkt files are out of date due to an upgrade. Here's
an example interaction in cygwin:

$ ./raco pkg show
C:\Users\asumu\AppData\Roaming\Racket\snapshot\pkgs\cext-lib\compiler\commands\compiled\info_rkt.zo::0: read (compiled): wrong version for compiled code
  compiled version: 5.90.0.11
  expected version: 5.91
  context...:
   standard-module-name-resolver
   C:\Users\asumu\Racket-5.91\collects\setup\getinfo.rkt:32:0: get-info/full
   C:\Users\asumu\Racket-5.91\collects\raco\all-tools.rkt:6:0: all-tools
   C:\Users\asumu\Racket-5.91\collects\raco\raco.rkt: [running body]
   C:\Users\asumu\Racket-5.91\collects\raco\main.rkt: [running body]

The error is unhelpful for most users, especially since the
"offending package" can't be uninstalled without `raco pkg`
(not that the package is actually at fault here).

 Another vaguely related issue I've seen twice now is that on upgrading
 the snapshot, I seem to get a database error related to the docs. I'm
 not sure exactly how to reproduce the setup (maybe I did something
 stupid), but here's the error I get on `raco setup -D`:
 
 query-rows: no such table: other.documented

 I believe I know how this happens, and it should be fixed when recent
 changes are merged to the release branch.
 
 (The problem with using `raco` and bad "info.rkt" files/bytecode also
 happens to be near the front of my queue this morning.)

  | raco: skip problem "info.rkt" files
  | 
  | Allows some `raco` tools to work (such as `raco pkg`) when loading
  | information about other installed tools fails, so that problems can
  | be more easily corrected using working tools (other than `raco setup`,
  | which is a special case, anyway, for bootstrapping).
