>Description:
Instances of structs exported with `contract-out' cannot be further contracted with `struct/c'. The attached example raises the following error:

struct/dc: expected an identifier that names a field or a sequence with a field name, the #:parent
 keyword, and the parent struct                                                                  
  at: provide/contract-id-foo-x
  in: (-struct/dc foo (provide/contract-id-foo-x ((x integer?))))

>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(module structs racket
  (struct foo (x))
  (provide (contract-out (struct foo ([x number?])))))

(require (submod "." structs))

(define/contract (dummy x)
  (-> (struct/c foo ([x integer?])) any/c)
  x)
