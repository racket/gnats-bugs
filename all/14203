I performed (require (planet jaymccarthy/datalog:1:3)). Installation attempted resulted in many errors listed in the log. Error messages from racket continued to appear whenever Racket restarted. 

Used (remove-pkg owner pkg maj min) in planet/utils. Racket then started up without errors. However, Racket was unable interpret/compile even simple definitions.

 That package is not supported at all. And in your release, 5.3.6,
 datalog is already installed:
