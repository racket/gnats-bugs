>Description:
I have installed DrDracket 6.0 in my Applications folder, per normal. Selecting "Racket Documentation" from "Help" menu of DrRacket yields the error:

browser-run: process execute failed: '(#<path:/usr/bin/osascript> "-e" "open location \"file:///Applications/Racket%20v6.9/doc/index.html\"")

I am running MacOS 10.12.5. "which osascript" yields "/usr/bin/osascript". Via Terminal, I have confirmed that "index.html" exists at the stated address.
>How-To-Repeat:
Select "Racket Documentation" from "Help" menu of DrRacket
