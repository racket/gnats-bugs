(find-seconds 0 0 0 19 10 2008) returns an error:

  find-secs: non-existent date (inputs: 0 0 0 19 10 2008)

Although per documentation this is a valid date.

It can parse (find-seconds 0 0 0 19 10 2007) and (find-seconds 0 0 0 19 10 2009) just fine.

 What platform are you using? Here's what I get, using the git head
 under mac os x:

 This works fine for me with git head and Ubuntu 12.04.

 I just tried 5.3 (built from source) on ubuntu 10.x and it also worked
 for me there.
 
 Diogo: if you have the energy to build from source and give it another
 try, that'd be appreciated.
 
 Also, if you can tell us which version of 5.3 you downloaded, that
 might also be a clue.

 Unfortunately, I can not replicate the bug either.  I'm on 5.3 under
 Mac OS X 10.8.2:

 We need some more information about your environment.  Any more
 information about your environment may provide a hint as to what's
 going wrong.  For example, do you know offhand if you are using the 32
 bit or 64 bit version of Ubuntu?

 FWIW, when I tested 5.3 on ubuntu 10.x, it was with the 32 bit version
 of Racket (don't know about the OS itself, tho).

 Sure!
 
 I downloaded the Unix source from Racket's page [1] for version 5.3 and
 compiled it in place using src/README instructions:
 
   From this directory (where the `configure' file is), run the following
   commands:
 
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ../configure
     make
     make install
 
 Then, I did:
 
 $ ./racket/racket3m 
 Welcome to Racket v5.3.
 > (require racket/date)
 > (find-seconds 0 0 0 19 10 2008)
 find-secs: non-existent date (inputs: 0 0 0 19 10 2008)
   context...:
    /tmp/racket-5.3/collects/racket/private/misc.rkt:87:7

 Anyone know how to get a 64bit build under ubuntu?
 
 On the mac and windows I know how to make either build but I'm not
 seeing a configure option for linux and I'm not sure where else to
 look, because I get a 32 bit build by default. Is it possible that I
 can't get one?

 I never thought about it, but `file' is telling me that the racket
 binary is an ELF 64-bit LSB executable:
 
   $ file racket 
   racket: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV),
   dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24,

 Diogo,
 
 Are you in the Brazilia timezone? And daylight saving time started on
 October 18 in 2008?
 
 I think that midnight of October 19, 2008 actually did not exist in
 that timezone. The clock jumped forward from 11:59pm of October 18 to
 1:00am on October 19.

 Nice! That's it!
 
 I guess this settles it.
 
 Thank you all. Sorry for the false alarm. :^(
