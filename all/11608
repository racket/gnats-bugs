>Description:
Supplying a `#lang htdp/asl' file on the
DrRacket command line seems to be different
than opening it after DrRacket starts.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file

 #lang htdp/asl
 (define x 10)

and supply the file to DrRacket on startup.
The stepper and Check Syntax buttons are
not available, but they appear if you edit
and revert the `#lang' line.

This problem doesn't seem to happen if the
file is opened after DrRacket starts.

 I don't suppose that this happens windows 7 for you, does it? (It
 doesn't happen for me.)
 
 I know that there is something wrong with the callbacks that update
 those buttons, but I don't know how to make it go wrong.

 Well, I just gave up and made a call to just set the right thing right
 before showing any new frame. Hopefully that'll take care of things.
