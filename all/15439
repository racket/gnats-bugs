>Description:
When building racket packages in openSUSE we always get different binaries for libracket3m-6.6.so and /usr/bin/racket

one contributing factor might be that files like
racket-6.6/src/racket/gc2/xsrc/jitarith.c
vary in their ordering of lines with
BLOCK_SETUP_TOP
BLOCK_SETUP

which hints at collects/compiler/private/xform.rkt
using random ordering for elements
>How-To-Repeat:
(e.g. on openSUSE) do
osc checkout openSUSE:Factory/racket
cd $_
for i in 1 2 ; do
  osc build --keep-pkg=RPMS$i # optional: --vm-type=kvm
  ( cd RPMS$i && unrpm racket-6.*.x86_64.rpm )
done
diff RPMS?/usr/bin/racket
