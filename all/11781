>Description:
init-manual-scrollbars method of canvas% mismatches documented range of v-length argument.   An error is raised if greater than 10,000 while the documentation indicates 1,000,000. 

(While I'd prefer an even bigger numeric limit, the 1,000,000 would help.  I'm using this as a scroller into a text buffer displayed in a canvas for which a text%/editor-canvas% 
combination is too slow.)
