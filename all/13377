 Which version of the spec are you looking at?  I can't find the part
 you're quoting at all in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455 which
 appears to be the current version of the spec.

 My quote is from the spec which is linked in the documentation as what
 the library is implementing.

 The spec linked from the docs [1] says:
 
    This draft is obsolete; it is an archival copy of the specification
    as it stood immediately before Ian Fette became the editor of the
    WebSocket protocol specification.
 
 It might well be a bunch of work to update the library to the current
 spec, but you might want to add a warning in the docs, since I don't
 think browsers implement that draft of the spec any more.

 Do you think the documentation is unclear about what spec it is
 implementing? If not, I'm not sure why the documentation should be
 anything other than "We implement Spec X." If you don't want "Spec X",
 then you don't want that library.
 
 I have no issues with someone making "Spec Y", but I have no use for
 Web Sockets at the moment, so I'm unlikely to do anything more than a
 blase implementation of the spec without enough attention to how
 people would want to use it.

 I'd expect a core racket library to be up to date enough with the specs to
 interoperate with other clients. As it stands it doesn't work currently
 with chrome, pr/13375. So both of these might be rephrased as a change
 request to update the library to the current spec. I didn't actually read
 the spec it was implementing because I assumed that it was close enough to
 the current spec to work, which it turns out is false.
 
 In terms of updating the library, what is the backwards compatibility
 requirement? I'm confused as to why it was not under unstable to begin
 with.

 Why would it be under unstable when it was up to date and worked great
 when it was written?

 Because it was known that it could change in the future. The same reason
 that browsers prefix new implementations with -moz, -webkit ... before a
 proposal is solidified. My understanding of current racket deprecation
 procedures is that all of the existing behavior is supposed to be
 maintained, even when not relevant to the current spec, and putting it
 unstable would have removed that requirement.
 
 Example: ws-recv shouldn't be able to return bytes?, and so any update
 would need to use a new name for that functionality.
 
 Maybe my understanding of how to update the interface of a racket library
 is wrong.
