>Description:
A scribble/lp (Literate Program) module cannot have a submodule
defined within it. Submodules enable unit-testing via "raco test",
so it would be desirable to be able to:

@chunk[<unit-tests>
(module+ test
 (require rackunit)
 (check-= (+ 2 2) 4 0 "ensure maths still work"))
]

But scribble/lp is in some way incompatible with this.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scribble/lp
@chunk[<*> (module+ test #t)]

Errors with:
 <unsaved editor>:2:11: #%module-begin: bad syntax in: (#%module-begin #t)

 BTW, `module` submodules actually do seem to work but `module*`
 submodules do not. The reason is that a `module*` inherits its
 `#%module-begin` from its enclosing module. Presumably the
 `#%module-begin` of scribble/lp was not written to play nice with
 submodules.
 
 Example:
 
   #lang scribble/lp
   @chunk[<a> (module main racket (provide x) (define x 3))]
   @chunk[<b> (module test racket
                (require rackunit (submod ".." main))
                (check-equal? x 3))]
   @chunk[<*> (begin <a> <b>)]
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
