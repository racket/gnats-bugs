>Description:
raco pkg update --clone typed-racket sets the origin URL as "git://github.com/racket/typed-racket/" where if you go to github and choose the ssh url it is "git@github.com:racket/typed-racket.git". I couldn't push changes back via this url though.

 I don't think raco pkg can know that you have push access or a SSH key
 that could contact that server.
