 Reported by Steve Johnson for release: 5.3.6
 
 
 *** Description:
 
 I am totally unable to select the teaching language; no matter what I
 select in the menu, the bottom left reads "Determine language from
 source" and "#lang racket" is inserted at the top of all my documents.
 
 
 This is OS X 64-bit.
 
 
 *** How to repeat:
 
 1. Delete prefs file to have a clean install (optional)
 
 2. Open DrRacket
 
 3. Open Language -> Choose Language
 
 4. Repeat step 3 until the OK button is actually clickable
 
 5. Select the different radio buttons a few times just for kicks before
 hitting OK
 
 5. Notice that the language is still 'determine from source'
 
 6. Try to drop in some HTDP examples and fail

 Thank you! That was very helpful.
 
 What happens if, after you click on the "Teaching languages" radio
 button, you actually click one of the languages listed below there and
 then click "ok"?

 Well, that works!
 
 None of those things looks clickable, though; it seems fair to expect
 that selecting a radio button makes the selection. Selecting 'racket'
 works fine, so why not 'teaching languages'? (I was also reading it as
 'teaching language', thinking it was just one thing.)
 
 I should also mention that I spent about 30 minutes in #racket with a
 friendly person trying to help me, and somehow it never came across that
 I was missing that crucial step.
 
 So I guess the bug is in the UI design, not the implementation. :-)

 Oh sorry: the bug is in the implementation. It should do like you say.
 I just asked this for confirmation that I understand the bug (and
 also, if it worked, to give you a work-around).
 
 I think that now you'll find that now when you click "teaching
 language" that some language actually does get selected and so you
 don't get the bad behavior anymore.

 Okay, I see what's going on: the dialog tracks the last time you chose
 a teaching language and, when you click on teaching language radio box
 (or type cmd-t) then it makes that one active. If you have never
 chosen a teaching language, then it was getting itself confused: it
 enabled the ok button and yet didn't make one of the teaching language
 choices enabled. I think the original intent was to make the ok button
 not be enabled in that case, but I've instead just made it pick the
 first teaching language it can find (presumably beginning student
 language, assuming you have the default installation).
