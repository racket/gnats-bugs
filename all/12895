>Description:
I have some beginning students that were searching the Help Desk for
built-in (primitive) functions in Racket. The students, of course, do
not call them primitive nor built-in functions. They are simply
searching for useful functions. For example, searching for:

   times, product, multiply, or multiplication did not yield *

   divide did not yield / nor quotient

   add, addition, or plus did yield +

   tangent did not yield tan

This, I believe, are enough examples to provide the flavor of the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Search the documents with the indicated words.
