 syntax-case is exported by racket/base. It isn't exported in phase 1,
 tho, only in phase 0.

 Hem... Sorry about that... It may not even be the first time I make this
 mistake.
 (Maybe some word about that in the docs for syntax-case would help me next
 time to not bother you about that anymore... There is an example far down
 in the page, but maybe a line at the top would be better?)
 
 However, I wonder why define-syntax and syntax-rules should be available
 directly from racket/base and syntax-case needs (for-syntax racket/base).
 Seems odd to me.

 `racket/base` exports `syntax-rules` and nothing else at phase 1.
