>Description:
The last paragraph of section 13.7 Mixins in the racket guide reads:
(I've  capitalized the words I think need to be changed)

Finally, the use of external names for class MEMBERS (instead of lexically scoped identifiers) makes mixin use convenient. Applying picky-mixin to person% works because the names eat and grow match, without any a priori declaration that eat and grow should be the same method in fish% and person%. This feature is a potential drawback when MEMBER names collide accidentally; some accidental collisions can be corrected by limiting the scope external names, as discussed in Controlling the Scope of External Names.

Should that read:

 I don't think this is a bug. After all, our mixins can add not only
 methods but also public fields and initialization arguments.

 I'm not sure. Class members are already mentioned earlier in this
 section. Maybe it could say "methods and other class members" the first
 time in this paragraph? Harry, would that make it clearer?

 As far as I can see at that point in the Racket Guide, the  mixin
 examples, hungry-mixin and picky-mixin only show the adding of methods
 to classes, so I think that would be clear if and only if the examples
 showed the adding of something other than methods otherwise its still
 a little confusing.  I think its best to spell things out for those of
 us who don't come from an OOP background.  To loosely quote Einstein
 "Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler". :-)
 
 Thanks again,

 Now I remember what was really confusing me.  It was what was meant by
 "class members".  I thought (from my non-OOP background) that it meant
 objects who were members of a particular class.
 i.e. (define charlie (new fish% [size 10])) .  I thought "class
 member" meant , charlie is a class member of the class fish%.  I had
 no idea it meant the methods, fields, inits etc. of a class.  Another
 place the terminology confused me, was the use of the term "field",
 till I kind of remembered that classes are based on structs and it
 just must mean the variable fields of the struct the class is
 constructed from.

 Perhaps we should switch to the Eiffel terminology of 'class feature'. Meyer seems to have understood the problem of 'member' and 'set' eh 'class' in the same context.

 13.7 Mixins
Date: Thu, 10 Jan 2013 23:04:02 -0500

 This is my attempt to make something that would be clearer to me.
 13.0
 ADD THIS SENTENCE (LIFTED FROM REFERENCE MANUAL) TO LAST PARAGRAPH. IN 13.0.
 In expressions within a class definition, the initialization
 variables, fields, and methods of the class can all be referenced.
 Within a method body, only the fields and other methods of the class
 can be referenced.
 
 13.7 Mixins
 PARAGRAPH 1
 Since class is an expression form instead of a top-level declaration
 as in Smalltalk and Java, a class form can be included within a lambda
 body.  Its superclass can be passed in as an argument since classes
 are first class values. This is a mixin, a function that returns a
 class whose methods and fields extend its superclass argument.
 ...
 .....
 LAST PARAGRAPH
 In addition to using methods to access fields they can be extracted
 and set directly using get-field and set-field!. Therefore both
 methods and fields have internal and external names.  The use of
 external names instead of lexically scoped identifiers for class
 methods and fields makes mixin use convenient.   picky-mixin can be
 applied both  to person% and fish% works because the names eat and
 grow match, without any requirement that eat and grow are the same
 method in fish% and person%. This feature is a potential drawback when
 method and field names collide accidentally; some accidental
 collisions can be corrected by limiting the scope external names, as
 discussed in Controlling the Scope of External Names.

 Is it the comparing of Racket to Java and Smalltalk which is
 objectionable or just this particular comparison?  I.e. should these
 other comparisons be removed?
 
 13.1
 PARAGRAPH 6
 Invocation of a method via send involves finding a method in the
 target objectâ€™s class at run time, making send comparable to an
 interface-based method call in Java.
 
 13.4
 13.4 Interfaces
 PARAGRAPH 1
 This use of interfaces is helpful even without a static type system
 (which is the main reason that Java has interfaces).
 
 13.5 Final, Augment, and Inner
 PARAGRAPH 1
 As in Java, a method in a class form can be specified as final, which
 means that a subclass cannot override the method.
 
 13.6
 RIGHT HAND BOX
 Javaâ€™s access modifiers (like protected) play a role similar to
 define-member-name, but unlike in Java, Racketâ€™s mechanism for
 controlling access is based on lexical scope, not the inheritance
 hierarchy.
