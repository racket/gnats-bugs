>Description:
I cannot use define/generic with gen:custom-write. The problem is that write-proc doesn't have a binding as it needs to.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require racket/generic)

(struct tuple (ref)
   #:methods gen:custom-write
   [(define/generic super write-proc)
    (define (write-proc v p w)
      (super v p w))])
