>Description:
This matches successfully as it should:

#lang racket
(require redex)

(define-language L
  (A ::= (hole x_2)
         (hole x_1 (in-hole A x_1)))
  (x ::= variable-not-otherwise-mentioned))

(redex-match L (in-hole A x) (term (y z (z t))))

But if I change "x_2" to "x_1" then redex-match returns #f. Shouldn't the two patterns defining A be independent?
