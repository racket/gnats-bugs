>Description:
If you give write-animated-gif an empty list of bitmaps, you
get a (car '()) error:

car: expects argument of type <pair>; given empty

The empty list is OK according to the contract given in 
Help Desk, but it's not clear what it should do in this
case (maybe (void)?).  But if it going to remain an error
case, the reporting should be improved and the contract
should be changed.

This bug is related to http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=11349
which triggers the (car '()) error from 2htdp/universe when
recording a world program as an animated gif when the program 
consists of a singleton world state.

Other small point: the scribble docs for write-animated-gif should
use "filename : path-string?" in place of "filename : path-string".

 I have imposed a contract on the function:=20

 and I have modified the docs accordingly. See _pair?_ in first list, =
 otherwise contracts are yours from doc.
 
 BUT, I don't know where the tests are (if any). Sorry.=20
