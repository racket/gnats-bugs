After open .dmg image and installing Racket-5.3.3.7, it won't launch  ia icon double-click due to a security violation "your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store.....".   

The workaround has been to right-click on DrRacket and select open.  This will bring up a similar dialog, however the right-click version permits opening anyway. After the initial opening, the application is no longer questioned.

 Oh-- and if you are so inclined, you may want to check our nightly builds,
 which should not have this problem. The nightly builds are generally
 stable, but there are occasional problems as the testing process before a
 release is more strenuous than the testing that we do on a nightly basis.

 Argh. I now see you're using a pre-release version downloaded from the
 nightly build page. Sorry for the confusion.
 
 I don't have 10.8.2, but under 10.7.5 I can turn on what I believe is the
 same setting as under a default 10.8.2, namely setting the "Allow
 applications downloaded from" radio button to "Mac App Store and identified
 developers". Is that what yours is set to?

 Actually, after this PR I realized that I didn't turn signing back
 on.  I did it, so the current build should be signed.
