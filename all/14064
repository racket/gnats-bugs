>Description:
Hi, the procedure uri-encode throws the following exception when attempting to encode certain strings:

vector-ref: index is out of range
  index: 244
  valid range: [0, 127]
  vector: '#("%00" "%01" "%02" "%03" "%04" "%05" "%06" "%07" "%08" "%09" "%0A" "%0B" "%0C" "%0D" "%0E" "%0F" "%10" "%11" "%12" "%13" "%...
  context...:
   /usr/lib/racket/collects/net/uri-codec.rkt:197:6: for-loop
   /usr/lib/racket/collects/net/uri-codec.rkt:195:0: encode
   /usr/lib/racket/collects/racket/private/misc.rkt:87:7

This happened when I called it with this string: "Kidô senkan Nadeshiko"

This works as expected under 5.3.4 and 5.2.1, i.e.
(uri-encode "Kidô senkan Nadeshiko") => "Kid%C3%B4%20senkan%20Nadeshiko"
>How-To-Repeat:
(require net/uri-codec)
(uri-encode "Kidô senkan Nadeshiko")

 I find that this example works in 5.90.0.9 (HEAD)
