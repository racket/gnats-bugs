>Description:
When using text/font to render a symbol font such as Wingdings on Windows or Dingbats in Ubuntu, the font does not render; instead, the latin text renders. A symbol font is a font where characters such as "a" correspond to symbols such as a snowflake; it does not require using unicode codes to print the symbol. On platforms where this fails, it fails on all symbol fonts. I am using the 5.3.1 binary downloaded from the Racket web site. I verified that the fonts work in other programs on the affected systems.

Platforms where it fails: Windows XP 32bit, Ubuntu 12.10 64bit
Platforms where it works: Ubuntu 12.04 32bit, Debian (not sure of the version info; a user in #racket tried it out)
>How-To-Repeat:
(text/font "abcd" 32 "black" "Wingdings" 'symbol 'normal 'normal #f)

Replace "Wingdings" with "Dingbats" on Ubuntu.

You can see a screenshot of the code working properly on my byzscribe github page: https://github.com/muraiki/byzscribe

For systems where it fails, instead of musical notation there will be latin characters such as "a12b" for a sequence of four symbols.
