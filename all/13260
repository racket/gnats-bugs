>Description:
I wanted to attempt to call new-∃/c in my interactive racket session. So I copiend the name from the website into the clipboard, but it wouldn't let me paste into the prompt correctly. Changing it just to ∃ made it not paste at all, showing that was the issue.

I can paste fine into my shell and vim.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Copy ∃ to clipboard
2. Open terminal
3. Execute racket
4. Load xrepl
5. Attempt to paste and fail.
