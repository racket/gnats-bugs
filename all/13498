raco pkg install: package is already installed

I think it's installed but not set up, but this is fairly confusing.

 The "raco setup" that "raco pkg" runs after installation is totally
 optional from the package system's perspective. Your package was
 installed totally correctly the first time, but the package itself had
 a problem so it failed to be initialized, which means that you
 wouldn't get its documentation and/or fast, compiled code.

 I think that need to be made clear to the user of the package system
 here, probably by catching various errors and printing messages about
 them.  I was certainly confused.
 
 Also, if packages are installing binaries/tools/etc, then setup isn't
 optional for them to work.
