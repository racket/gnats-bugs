>Description:
(A high priority feature request)

(define-struct bag (content))
;; Bag is (make-bag String)

(define bag1 (make-bag "lipstick"))
(define bag2 (make-bag "HtDP"))

is a perfect program. When a student clicks RUN, 
it complains with "this program should be tested"
and that is an obstacle. Students will start ignoring
this request. 

So can we NOT show this message if the Def Window contains only 
define-struct and expression definitions (as oppossed to function
definitions)? 

Thanks. It would be a sign. psychological improvement.
