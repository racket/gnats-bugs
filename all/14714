linux-fedora
>Description:
Perhaps some of these things are intentional, but here's a list of
things that don't look right to me in the toplevel README file:

1. The name at the top that I see is:

     This is the
       {1} Racket | {3} Linux | x86_64 (64-bit), built on Precise Pangolin
     distribution for version 6.1.

   * The {1} and {3} and the "|"s look like some mistake

   * The "(64-bit)" is redundant given that "x86_64" appears right
     before that

   * "Precise Pangolin" is too obscure, it should mention Ubuntu
     (assuming it was built there)

   * I don't know how "Precise Pangolin" is generated, but note that on
     other distros (like on Fedora), the version number is the more
     dominant choice.  (Ie, "Fedora Heisenbug" would confuse most
     people, since they'll expect "Fedora 20".)

   * On Windows, the string is "{1} Racket | {1} Windows | x86_64
     (64-bit)" which makes the {1}s look even more like mistakes.

   * Also, if the lack of a "built on" in the Windows version means that
     it's added only on some platforms (where the information may be
     relevant), then it's probably better to parenthesize it (the "built
     on ..." bit).

2. In the next paragraph, the comma in "... consulted, first." looks
   redundant.  Also, if it's consulted *first*, then there should also
   be some mention of what it consults next.

3. Finally there is a:

     Visit
        http://racket-lang.org/
     for more Racket resources.

   which is bad for two picky reasons: (1) the url is indented by three
   spaces where previous indents had two; (2) it looks weird to break
   the lines there rather than just leaving it all on a single line.

4. Looking at the source, I see lots of @"\n" used.  So a quick note:
   the scribble reader ignores an initial and a final newline, but it
   won't ignore too -- so instead of

     @~a{@"\n"foo bar
         baz@"\n"}

   you can use

     @~a{

       foo bar
       baz

     }

   which makes it much easier to deal with the text instead of guessing
   how much the source doesn't correspond to the output.
