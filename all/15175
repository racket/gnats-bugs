>Description:
The program below doesn't seem to parse...should it?
>How-To-Repeat:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60 has this example:

procedure Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);
    value n, m; array a; integer n, m, i, k; real y;
comment The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m,
    is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;
begin
    integer p, q;
    y := 0; i := k := 1;
    for p := 1 step 1 until n do
        for q := 1 step 1 until m do
            if abs(a[p, q]) > y then
                begin y := abs(a[p, q]);
                    i := p; k := q
                end
end Absmax

 PS: either way, the docs should include at least one working program,
 which would be helpful for demo purposes.
