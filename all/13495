>Description:
Suppose you install a package with shared scope (-s):

  raco pkg install -s ralist

then it'll show up in your package listing:

$ raco pkg show
Installation-wide:
 [none]
User-specific, all-version:
 Package[*=auto]    Checksum                                    Source
 lang-slide         40f30a8ce128493c887dc0c0bb0798fab6514837    (pns lang-slide)
 ralist             da1c9c6f28185e8f4afb496d5b9c93e048c22018    (pnr ralist)
 taglib             54e10203115aa2901e00da60e0cc25ed2043a1a4    (pns taglib)
User-specific, version-specific:
 Package[*=auto]    Checksum                                    Source
 sweet-exp          fbd09b4be38b3c58b1e231c68d1d7c1e14accb2b    (pnr sweet-exp)

However, if you try to remove it:

$ raco pkg remove ralist
raco pkg remove: package not currently installed
  package: ralist
  currently installed:
   sweet-exp

The error message is puzzling. It works as expected with the right scope:

  raco pkg remove -s ralist

The error message should probably indicate that the package wasn't
found in the current scope, but may be installed in others (maybe even
checking which flag would work).

 I disagree with this. When you use those switches, you are telling
 raco pkg to only consider a particular repository. Perhaps what you
 want is for it to just say
 
 raco pkg remove: package not currently installed
   package: ralist
   scope: user-specific, all-version
   currently installed:
    sweet-exp
 
 But I don't like it when tools repeat information that you just wrote
 on the command-line a single line above.

 But Asumu didn't write anything at all on the command line above, he
 just used the defaults.

 I don't find that compelling. You should know your configuration
 options when you use command line tools.
 
 If the defaults would ever get in his way, it's because he has chosen
 not to use the defaults at some point, so he knows that they exist and
 why he did not choose to use them on this particular command.

 I also disagree with Jay (if he's saying nothing needs fixing): the
 sequence of commands that Asumu sent and the messages he got back are
 confusing, to say the least.
 
 The "you should know your tools" comment is also wrong, in my opinion. The
 error messages and output generally that you get from your tools should
 help you learn how to use them better, not punish you for not already
 knowing subtle details.

 The error message comes from here:
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/collects/planet2/lib.rkt#L282-286
 
 These parameters describe what the current scope is:

 Does this mean "I agree that the error message is suboptimal; patches
 welcome."?

 This means "I agree that Sam, Asumu, Robby, and potentially many other
 users don't like the error message; patches are welcome, if you still
 have trouble after these pointers, bug me again".
 
 (I don't want to make the change myself, not because I'm jerk
 (although I am), but because I would just add "scope: blah", but I get
 the impression that SAR don't think that would be best, so I'd like to
 empower you to get it the way you think would be best. Basically, this
 is a kind of dog food I can't eat, so I'm not a good designer of it.)

 I've attached a patch that implements a different error message in this
 case. For the before & after, see this gist:
   https://gist.github.com/takikawa/4954230
 
 Any opinions on the patch or the new error message?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 I think this is a good direction, but (underscores added to emphasize
 spacing)
 
  raco pkg remove: package installed in a different scope: shared
  __consider using the --shared flag
  _
  __current scope: user
  __package: taglib
  __currently installed: [none]
 
 doesn't fit the error-message guidelines. I think it should be
 
  raco pkg remove: package installed in a different scope;
  _consider using the --shared flag
  __package: taglib
  __current scope: user
  __installed scope: shared

 I think the patch is good and thanks for adding the test case too.
