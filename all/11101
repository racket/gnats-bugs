>Description:
On occasion check-syntax does not automatically hide the error window 
after a syntactic error has been fixed. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Edit a syntactically correct program so that it is missing a close 
  paren for a parameter list.

Check syntax. Notice error window. 

Restore the missing paren. 

Hit run. 

Check syntax again. Notice how the old error window is still open.
