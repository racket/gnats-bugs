Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt@racket-lang.org at Fri, 25 Jul 2014 04:45:30 -0400
Reason>>> A commit by mflatt@racket-lang.org was marked as relevant
  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/b25a2b83ba
  | The implementation of `#%top` within a `module` has, for a while,
  | required that the identifier wrapped by `#%top` not have a local
  | binding. Change the documentation to match the implementation in that
  | way. (Since local binding in an identifier's lexical information
  | contributes to its identity as a top-level binding, that specification
  | of `#%top` would make sense everywhere, but I've left the top level
  | alone for backward compatibility.)
  | 
  | Also, change `local-expand` to never introduct `#%top`
  | wrappers. That's a little more consistent with what `#%top` has
  | evolved to mean, and it specifically works better with
  | `local-expand/capture-lifts`.
  | 
  | Closes PR 14635 and PR 14654
