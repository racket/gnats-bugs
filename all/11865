>Description:
In doc/guide/Continuations.html (second to last paragraph), it says:

A more traditional continuation operator in Racket is call-with-current-continuation, which is often abbreviated call/cc. It is like call-with-composable-continuation, but applying the captured continuation first aborts (to the current prompt) before restoring the saved continuation. In addition, Racket systems traditionally support a single prompt at the program start, instead of allowing new prompts via call-with-continuation-prompt.

I think both of those should say Scheme, not Racket, while the later uses of Racket in that paragraph are fine.
