>Description:
The Run command in DrRacket always focuses the REPL if it's displayed. This introduces an annoying re-focus gesture for the user after every evaluation.

The programmer probably wants to see the result of expressions and tests when pressing Run. She may not want DrRacket to move the cursor (That's how I feel, anyway).

 There doesn't appear to be a way to communicate this to the IDE.
