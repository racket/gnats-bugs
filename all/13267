>Description:
In online expansion mode, when there is a paren mismatch, the indication of this is at the bottom-right, but the bottom left still says "Online expansion finished".  This latter phrase is also used when the buffer is okay (and, in a typed setting, has typed-checked).  While technically correct, this is pretty misleading when in fact your buffer may be full of errors.  

(In fact, I just got burned by this.  It was worse for me because I knew my parens weren't mismatched, so I wasn't even looking at the bottom-right.  Turns out there was a stray |# in my buffer.)

I would far prefer if it only gave this very string when the buffer is indeed valid, and not use this phrase in any other circumstances, so that it has a clear, unambiguous, and good association.  In the mismatched paren case, for instance, it could say "Online expansion suspended due to mismatched parentheses" -- or even just put the ()) icon where it otherwise has text about the expansion status!

 I think probably you want to open the preferences dialog, click on
 "background expansion" and change the first popup menu to "in the
 margin".
 
 I certainly agree with you that the current interaction is bad (the
 above is just a way to avoid it for now).
 
 FWIW, I was trying to find a way to avoid having that bar on the
 bottom appear (well, appear less anyways) but it doesn't really work,
 so I should probably just abolish that mode.
