>Environment:
Linux i686 / Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101027 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.6.12
>Description:
The last-picture function given to stop-when is used, but the final display is overwritten using the original on-draw function when time stops.  According to the documentation this behaviour is incorrect.

Also noticed it on Windows (i.e., doesn't seem Linux specific).
>How-To-Repeat:
The following snippet should end with a red rectangle, not a blue one. The red one flashes, but is replaced by the result of the original draw function.


#lang racket
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define (draw w) 
  (overlay (text (number->string w) 20 "white")
           (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "blue")))
(define (last w) 
  (overlay (text (number->string w) 20 "white")
           (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "red")))
(big-bang 0
          (on-draw draw)
          (on-tick add1 1)
          (stop-when (lambda (w) (> w 4))
                     last))
