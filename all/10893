>Description:
Racket's "do" supports loops with no finish-exprs. Typed/scheme's "do:" does not, and when given such a loop gives an error message about begin.
>How-To-Repeat:
(do: : Void ((i : Integer 0 (+ i 1)))
     ((= i 10))
     (display i)
     (newline))

gives the error:
begin: bad syntax (empty form) in: (begin)
