I have this same issue. DrRacket is using 761.4MB (!) of memory. Macbook Pro OS 10.11.5 OSX El Capitan, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7. Takes almost 4 seconds to get this interpreted and output:

(check-expect (yell "book") (string-append "book" "!"))

(check-expect (yell "!") (string-append "!" "!"))

(define (yell str) (string-append str "!") )

It shouldn't happen. Which DrRacket version did you install?

The one found on this course page:1a: Beginning Student Language > Expressions > Expressions, pt 1 which links to this page: http://racket-lang.org/download/, from there I downloaded this: racket-6.6-x86_64-macosx.dmg (103M)

There might be some issue in this racket version.

I suggest you do this:

Report your problem to the racket users mailing list [racket developers will reply]:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users

In the meantime try either a previous release, or if you believe you can, try to compile from sources. For the former, follow this link: https://download.racket-lang.org/all-versions.html and pick a previous Racket version.

Just tried several builds. The problem is reproduced in the builds from 6.5 down to 6.3. Build 6.2.1 works well.

I have tested x86_64 builds on OS X El Capitan. Flawed builds show blinking recycling icon in the bottom right corner while executing the code.

UPD. I've reported the bug here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/racket-users/4bpQniHuToE

Great! Hope you can solve the issue and help racket developers find the bug, if any.

DrRacket build 6.6 (x86 and x64) on Window 10 running slow, even when given unlimited memory and I've got 12GB.

Read post by inkuzmin.

Can confirm that bulid 6.2.1 works beautifully.

Thanks inkuzmin, can now enjoy the course. (Can't vote on his response, so voted up question)
