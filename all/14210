>Description:
I have installed a racket-5.3.6 package and can not launch any binary contained in it. At first this was a package from Arch Linux distribution, but then I compiled racket from source and still got the same crash, so this is not a distro packaging bug.

Segfaults happen only when running inside terminal emulator, moreover - I found that they all crash only when run from a 'bash' shell. If I launch a 'zsh' session, all works. Here's what it looks like for me (in 'bash'):

# racket
Welcome to Racket v5.3.6.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

# drracket
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

# raco 
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Additional info:
racket 5.3.6
Linux dimsuzhost 3.12.1-3-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Nov 26 11:17:02 CET 2013 x86_64 GNU/Linux
>How-To-Repeat:
Steps to reproduce:
Start any binary from above examples

I tried to see backtrace of the crash in gdb:

#0 0x00007ffff7b021c8 in scheme_gmp_tls_unload () from /usr/lib/libracket3m-5.3.6.so
#1 0x00007ffff7acb4b3 in done_with_GC () from /usr/lib/libracket3m-5.3.6.so
#2 0x00007ffff7b0bb11 in garbage_collect () from /usr/lib/libracket3m-5.3.6.so
#3 0x00007ffff7b11f7e in GC_malloc_one_tagged () from /usr/lib/libracket3m-5.3.6.so
#4 0x00007ffff7860284 in scheme_malloc_fail_ok () from /usr/lib/libracket3m-5.3.6.so
#5 0x00007ffff7aecf4c in scheme_make_vector () from /usr/lib/libracket3m-5.3.6.so
...

But the thing is that googling this told me that this is some common signal and it should be ignored during debugging, it most probably is not the issue. If I instruct gdb to ignore this signal (as google results suggest) and put 'br abort', than it just crashes, no br is triggered.
