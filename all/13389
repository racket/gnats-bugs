>Description:
The documentation says that the listen-ip argument of serve/servlet can be #f, but I get the following error if I do that.

tcp-listen: listen failed

  system error: Address already in use; errno=48

   run-server
There was an error starting the Web server.

          (body (p "Hey out there!")))))

 This error has nothing to do with the #f. It means that you are
 already using port 8000 with your IP.

 No, not necessarily.  I would not assume this, not without further
 input from  Eric.  I encountered something like this with regards to
 being off of a network on my Macbook Air, and reported this as Bug
 #13193:

 In any case, the Web server does "like" #f and it is used all the
 time. Perhaps it is the semantics of #f that Eric is looking for
 further explanation of and that the documentation could provide.
 
 BTW, In your report, #f and "127.0.0.1" don't mean at all the same
 thing. #f means roughly "use all the IPs" whereas "127.0.0.1" means
 "just use localhost". My guess is that when you aren't on any network,
 #f doesn't bind to anything, so the listen fails, but there's isn't a
 separate error code for that situation and Racket is just exposing the
 underlying Unix error message.

 I am connected to a network, and it happens no matter which port I use. I
 believe the bug started appearing around my upgrade to 10.8.2.
 
 I know that the two are different, but I believe that something is up with
 listening on all ports on my and Danny's setup. I expect #f to work on all
 ips of the machine, just like the documentation says (and not crash). I can
 not get it to work, and I expect the same for anyone on the same setup as
 me.

 I talked to Greg Hendershott on IRC, and he has 10.7.5 and is not getting
 the error. Thus confirming it is a slightly newer bug, so it would help if
 someone would confirm what behavior is expected on 10.8.2.

 Can you run:
 
 #lang racket
 (tcp-listen 8000 5 #t #f)
 
 ?

 The following program fails with the error.
 
 tcp-listen: listen failed
   port number: 8000
   system error: Address already in use; errno=48
   context...:
    /Users/endobson/tmp/tmp.rkt: [running body]
 
 The same happens with port 8786 (shouldn't be in use by anyone). And
 succeeds if #f is changed to "127.0.0.1".
 
 Thus the issue is not with the webserver but the lowlevel tcp libraries.
