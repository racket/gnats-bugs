>Description:
When I load any substantial code into DrRacket, my CPU kicks into overdrive and everything in the editor grinds to a halt. When it does settle down, the delay in response to editor operations (scroll, move cursor, type, etc.) is high enough to render DrRacket useless as an editor.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sit in front of my machine, open any .rkt file in DrRacket, type anything into the file or navigate using the arrow keys, wait for the battery to die.

 There is blue/purple/green (depending on what it is doing) bubble in
 the bottom right corner of DrRacket. If you click on it, you should
 get a menu item that says "disable background evaluation".
 
 Does that help?
