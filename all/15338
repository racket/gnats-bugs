>Description:
while trying to rename an id, the context popup menu closes itself for no reason, even while still selecting the popup menu item.
obs: I have noted the issue is related to the arrow helpers in Dr. Racket. I was trying to reproduce the error, but failed, by clicking on the end of the word and desobstructing the popup menu when it shows.
>How-To-Repeat:
;define an id

  (set! btn-ok (new button% [parent frm-main] ...)

;right-click the definition of frm-main, the popup menu shows up and closes itself almost instantly

 Does the problem go away if you set the environment variable to
 PLT_GTK2 before starting DrRacket?
