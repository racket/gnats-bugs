>Description:
Two weeks ago there was an exchange w/ Chuck Rich where he asked how
one could clear the coloring done by DrRacket -- errors, lack of
coverage, etc.  In the process I said that it goes away automatically
after a while, to which Robby said, "It isn't supposed to go away
until you edit something."

This confused me, because I know for a fact I've seen it disappear
after a while, but then Robby would know whether he wrote any such
code, and he didn't, so....

Yesterday in class, someone brought a (sort of) opposite problem.  He
said, "If I run Check Syntax, how do I keep the colors?"  I explained
that once you start to edit, the Check Syntax might become invalid.
But, he said, he meant that he was losing the coloring even if he did
no edits at all.  I said that's impossible: the person who wrote the
code said there was no such code in the system.  But other students
said no, they too had seen the color disappear.

Then one of my other students said, "Wait a minute.  I've noticed that
if you SAVE the file, it loses its colorings.  Drracket does an
auto-save.  Could that be the thing causing the coloring to go away?"
(This blew away the whole class.)

I have now validated this conjecture.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create the file

(define (f x)
  (+ x x))

and save it.  Now add something (eg, an extra blank line at the end)
and do not save.  Run Check Syntax and see the arrows.  Wait ~4m30s.
You will see an auto-save file

ventoux ~/Desktop> ls -l foo.*
-rwx------+ 1 sk None 12237 2010-10-02 08:44 foo.1
-rwx------+ 1 sk None   453 2010-10-02 08:40 foo.rkt

and the Check Syntax is gone.
