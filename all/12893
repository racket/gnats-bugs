>Release:        5.2.1
>Environment:
Linux x86_64 / Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.16) Gecko/20120602 Iceweasel/3.5.16 (like Firefox/3.5.16)
>Description:
If using a custom install path that begins with '~' (e.g. ~/racket64), the script will install drracket into the local directory appended with the given path ( ./~/racket64 ), instead of the expected directory under home ( /home/USERNAME/racket64 ).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. CD into a directory that is NOT the root of your home directory ( /home/USERNAME/somedir instead of /home/USERNAME/ )
2. Run the current build script.
3. Install without unix-style distribution, and with custom directory ~/racket64.
4. Script will install drracket into /home/USERNAME/somedir/~/racket64
5. Do NOT then cd into /home/USERNAME/somedir and run "rm -rf ~" to get rid of the test install :p
