>Description:
When I run the program below from the command prompt, the window appears but then the program does not exit (altho I think it is supposed to).

I was running it like this:

C:\Users\Administrator\git\plt>Racket.exe collects\games\paint-by-numbers\raw-problems\build-solution-sets.rkt skip
the end

but when you run it in Gracket.exe, then you get the extra command.com window, but you don't see the "exited" message and the frame doesn't go away.

(As you can probably tell, this is the result of looking into a drdr failure for build-solution-sets.rkt and narrowing down the program.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define memory-frame (parameterize ([current-eventspace (make-eventspace)])
                       (make-object frame% "frame" #f 500 50)))
(send memory-frame show #t)
(printf "the end\n")
