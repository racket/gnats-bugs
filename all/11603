>Description:
1. Say you have a class contract cls/c

2. Now you want to formulate a function/method contract that says map instances of a class 
   that satisfies cls/c to, oh, numbers. 

3. At the moment you have to copy-repeat the field and method specifications in cls/c. 
   
We should have an operation "instance-of" on contracts instead. Thanks.
