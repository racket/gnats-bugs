>Description:
On the command-line tools page, in the shell completion section:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/cmdline-tools.html#%28part._.Shell_completion%29

There is a DEAD link to the shell-completion scripts:

https://github.com/plt/racket/tree/master/collects/meta/contrib/completion

Here is a working link:

https://github.com/racket/shell-completion

You should switch 'em.
