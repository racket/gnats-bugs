>Description:
I think it would be better to change the text selection behaviour so that when you select code with colon (:), it does not include the symbol in its selection.

For example, if I have the following comment in the definition window:

;; my-function: Num Num -> Sym

Double clicking "my-function" should only select "my-function" instead of "my-function:" as it currently does.
>How-To-Repeat:
For example, typing: 
;; my-function: Num Num -> Sym

and double clicking "my-function" to select the text.
>Fix:
