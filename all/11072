>Description:
Kathi and I have a demo to give tomorrow.  Our app uses the web server
infrastructure.  She sent me an updated version this evening, and she
and I spent a frustrating while trying to debug some code.  In
particular, I spent ten minutes from my airplane seat on the phone w/
her trying to figure out why our demo for tomorrow wasn't working.

Well, I finally figured it out.  I had launched an older version of
the app in another tab in DrRacket yesterday.  It was still running.
The new version uses the SAME URL as the old version -- but when you
click Run in the new tab, it fires up the browser, etc., just as if it
were about to launch the new app.

C'mon, Jay!  You know better than to make such a rudimentary mistake.

 If you run two web-server/insta apps, then one you run second will
 display this in the Interaction window:
 
 tcp-listen: listen on 8000 failed (Address already in use; errno=3D48)
 Your Web application is running at
 http://localhost:8000/servlets/standalone.rkt.
 Click 'Stop' at any time to terminate the Web Server.
 
 and the program will remain running. This shows that there is an error
 starting the server.
 
 I've just pushed a patch that changes it so the second will display:
 
 tcp-listen: listen on 8000 failed (Address already in use; errno=3D48)
 There was an error starting the Web server.
 	The TCP port (8000) is already in use.
 
 and return immediately.

 I was afraid you would say this (balloonists asking mathematicians for
 directions).
 
 If you run over 50 times a day, as I've been doing lately, you do NOT
 read the text that is printed in the console.
 
 What's worse is that after you click Run, focus shifts to the new
 browser window.  So you don't even see the text.
 
 If you want to signal an error, signal an ERROR using the error
 mechanisms in the language -- you know, like pink highlighting -- not
 using some random text amidst lots of other text.  Any other fix is
 still a BUG.
 
 Moreover, I don't see why this should be an error at all.  Why can't
 DrRacket just launch two separate Web instances, so I can test both?
 Isn't this just the sort of thing that DrRacket should make easy that
 other platforms make hard?

 How about saying 8000 is in use and sequentially trying to use 8001-8100 
 before giving up.

 Did you read my whole message? Did you try the patch? A few of your
 comments indicate you did not.

 Since the patch catches the error early, the focus will not shift.

 Both the old behavior and the new behavior raise an error. DrRacket
 prints it in red, but doesn't highlight anything because your program
 doesn't contain any part of the stack that failed.

 If you want to use a normal Web browser, then it needs to open a
 normal TCP port. (If you wanted to use a fake DrRacket Web browser, we
 could use direct Racket channels for communication, but I presume you
 don't want that.)
 
 Since it needs a normal TCP port, there is a chance that whatever is
 chosen will conflict with some existing application, even if I
 randomly picked a port.
 
 However, I read up and there is something called an "ephemeral" port
 number where you let the OS decide the port number just before the
 server starts. web-server/insta uses that now. So you shouldn't have a
 problem with the latest push.
