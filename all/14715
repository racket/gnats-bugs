>Description:
After working for a while, the uninstaller said that not all files were
removed, and suggested trying to remove everything.  I don't remember
the phrasing, but this is a failsafe thing that I implemented in the
original uninstaller script: it first removes everything registered by
the script, and if there are leftovers, it makes that suggestions and
will just try to remove the whole tree if the user agrees.  (The idea is
that some people might have put their own stuff there.)

In any case, sometimes Windows wouldn't be able to remove something
which would lead to this situation -- but when I ran it now there was a
pretty big number of files removed.  Running the uninstaller again
(after a re-install) shows that the files in question are the whole
"collects" directory -- which means that there's a missing entry in the
NSIS script for it.

  | Windows installer: uninstall "collects"
  | 
  | Closes PR 14715, where Eli describes the repair
  | 
  | (Probably, the "collects" directory was missing from the uninstaller
  | list because "collects" moved under "lib" in an intermediate variant
  | of the directory organization.)
