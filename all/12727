I'm trying to build Racket under Mageia Linux, a new distro.

"raco setup" is called with "-j 1" option (doesn't build at all without it). Build fails on raco setup stage with the following:

raco setup: error: during Building docs for /home/mitya/mandriva/racket/BUILDROOT/racket-5.2.1-1.mga2.i386/usr/lib/racket/collects/scribblings/draw/draw.scrbl
raco setup:   png_structp->C: expected argument of type <non-null `png_structp' pointer>; given #f
raco setup: error: during Building docs for /home/mitya/mandriva/racket/BUILDROOT/racket-5.2.1-1.mga2.i386/usr/lib/racket/collects/images/scribblings/images.scrbl

raco setup: error: during Building docs for /home/mitya/mandriva/racket/BUILDROOT/racket-5.2.1-1.mga2.i386/usr/lib/racket/collects/teachpack/teachpack.scrbl
raco setup:   make-bitmap: expects type <exact-positive-integer> as 1st argument, given: 0; other arguments were: 0 #t

A full build log can be provided if needed. This bug may be also related to bug #12726.

 Yes, I believe that this is the same as 12726, since the documentation
 build is trying to use libpng.
