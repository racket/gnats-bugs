Windows 8.1, 64-bit
>Description:
Not sure if this is an ODBC driver issue, or a Racket issue, but DrRacket will crash almost always when running the attached sample script twice. It works the first time, but the second time fails (although if you are quick enough the second one may run, and the third time will fail).

I am brand new to Racket (really want to see if I can replace R for my analytical work; for fun), so if I'm doing something wrong please do let me know. I failed to find any way to get this to work.

The error that pops up in a command window when this crashes is:
Seg fault (internal error) at 10

I am connecting to a SQL Server 2005 instance from a 64-bit Windows 8.1 workstation. I have also tried hitting a SQL 2014 instance, but get the same issue.

I have tried all the listed drivers for SQL server from (odbc-drivers), same result for each.

I have also tried a DSN connection, but same issue.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require db)

(define sqlc (odbc-driver-connect "Driver={ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server};Server=<Server>;Database=<Database>;Trusted_Connection=yes;"))

(query-rows sqlc "select top 10 ID from <Table>")

 As a test I also used the sample from the virtual-connection documentation. I can run many queries one the connection is open, but as soon as I call (disconnect c) it crashes. So it seems related to the connection handing. Again, not sure if itâ€™s the driver or the Racket implementation.

 A few extra tests with other environments points to this being very specific to DrRacket. If I do
 the same thing using Racket in the command prompt, then all appears well (although not sure 
 if the (disconnect c) is actually working, as I can query multiple times after this).
 
 If I use R (via RStudio) the same ODBC connection configuration is stable and works.
