>Description:
Copy some text in Opera on linux, paste into drracket.  In 5.0.2, it
freezes for a few seconds and then does nothing, but in gr2 I've seen
it do one of these things:

* Paste the text

* Get drr stuck after this warning:
  (<unknown>:6602): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_main_loop_quit: assertion `loop != NULL' failed
  After that it won't respond to plain breaking.

* Crash with: SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0x5800248c

The first and last options were very rare (I had one of each only),
but the second one was very reproducible.

 I saw this repeatably pasting from Firefox, and then it went away and
 hasn't happened since. It happened particularly when replacing the
 entire contents of the definitions window by pasting.

 I didn't have the whole window, and didn't try to paste a lot of
 text.  Also, some students said that this happened for a while, which
 is how I got to it.  (And I was surprised by presence of a bug in both
 gr1 and gr2...)

 32 -- running on champlain.  (Both drr and opera on the same machine,
 and opera installed from the rpm they have on their site.)

 I've been seeing pasting problems from Opera with 5.0.2, too: DrRacket
 doesn't crash for me though, it just pauses for a few seconds and then
 ends up having pasted nothing.
