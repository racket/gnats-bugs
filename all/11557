>Description:
In the program below, I can not get the combo field's popup menu to stay open.  Sometimes it flickers the three choices A/B/C for a split second, then vanishes.  Sometimes it never shows up, perhaps appearing and disappearing too fast to see.  I have only been able to reproduce the problem when the combo field's on-popup method triggers the show method on a "switchable" button.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(require mrlib/switchable-button)

(define popup-combo-field%
  (class combo-field%
    (init-field popup-callback)
    (define/override (on-popup e)
      (popup-callback this e)
      (super on-popup e))
    (super-new)))

(define frame (new frame% [label "The Frame"]))
(define button
  (new switchable-button%
    [parent frame]
    [label "The Button"]
    [bitmap (make-object bitmap% 1 1)]
    [callback void]))
(define combo
  (new popup-combo-field%
    [parent frame]
    [label #f]
    [choices (list "A" "B" "C")]
    [popup-callback (lambda (c e) (send button show #t))]))

(send frame show #t)
