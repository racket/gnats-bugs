>Description:
When a test is stopped, check-expect should record it as failing, or at least as not passing.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put

(define (inf-loop x) (inf-loop x))

in the definitions window, then run

(check-expect (inf-loop 5) 3)

in interactions. After a while, click Stop. The output is "user break" followed by "The test passed!".
