>Description:
This is cross platform: I have confirmed it in 32 and 64 bit Windows and on 64-bit Linux in both the Ubuntu/Debian release and in one I built from source for CentOS.

equal? always returns #t for two bit-vectors having equal length where the length is <= 8.  The element values are ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require data/bit-vector)

(for [(len (in-range 1 10))]
  (let [
        (x (make-bit-vector len #t))
        (y (make-bit-vector len #f))
       ]
    (printf "~s: ~s ~s  (equal?) ~s~n" 
            len 
            (bit-vector->string x)
            (bit-vector->string y)
            (equal? x y))
    ))

=>
1: "1" "0"  (equal?) #t
2: "11" "00"  (equal?) #t
3: "111" "000"  (equal?) #t
4: "1111" "0000"  (equal?) #t
5: "11111" "00000"  (equal?) #t
6: "111111" "000000"  (equal?) #t
7: "1111111" "0000000"  (equal?) #t
8: "11111111" "00000000"  (equal?) #t
9: "111111111" "000000000"  (equal?) #f

Reason>>> 
This has been fixed in the pre-release version. You can get it either 
via git or via the snapshot builds:
