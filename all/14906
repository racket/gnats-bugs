>Description:
Rapidly clicking "Replace" to replace text in DrRacket produces improperly replaced text.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open DrRacket
2) Past this in the definitions window:

#lang racket

(define (foo x) x)

(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)
(foo 1) (foo 1) (foo 1)



3) Open the find/replace menu
4) Enter the string '(foo' in the find text box and '`,(foo' in the replace text box (without the outer set of quotes)
5) Click the "Replace" button really fast to start replacing text. Clicking fast enough will basically produce '`(fooooooo...' in the document before the search/replace focus jumps to the next occurrence of '(foo'.
