>Description:
Every time I start up DrRacket, the module language option "preserve stacktrace" is switched on. I usually switch it off such as to enable better optimization (may make a difference of a factor 2) As the no/yes debugging otion is memorized, would it be possible to memorize the setting of "preserve stacktrace" too? In the prefs, or in the source code file itself? I always have "determine language from source" enabled and this is memorized.

As far as I know, "my problem" is present in all previous builds too.

Thanks, Jos
