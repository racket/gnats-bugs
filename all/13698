>Description:
When you successfully submit a bug in DrRacket (and get the confirmation
window) and then immediately switch to and close the main DrRacket
window, the bug confirmation window still remains open.

Maybe this isn't a bug, but the behavior was surprising to me.

The same applies to the macro stepper window.

The stepper window in *SL does the same, but helpfully shows a warning if the
main program window closes. It also has a "new" menu item so that you can actually
restore the main window. Maybe the other tool windows should have this too?
