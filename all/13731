 I don't know what you mean by "locations", but there is a way to
 search index entries from a specific manual -- for example, type
 
     do T:guide
 
 and you'll get all of the index entries that have "do" in them that
 are also in the guide.
 
 But if you're asking for a full-text search, then we don't have that
 since the search is all happenning on the client.  The on-line version
 has now a google search box, and you can do some full-text searches --
 the closest thing to all mentions of "do" in the guide that I could
 find is entering this
 
     inurl:guide "do"
 
 (in the google search box), but it finds a lot of noise since "do" is
 a common word.
