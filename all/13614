>Description:
I expect that check-metafunction should have found the bug in the contract in this example, but it didnt.

check-metafunction: /Users/endobson/tmp/tmp.rkt:20
no counterexamples in 1000 attempts (with each clause)
var-promote: codomain test failed for Int, call was (var-promote Int (x))

   /Users/endobson/tmp/tmp.rkt: [running body]
>How-To-Repeat:

 I think I misunderstood what check-metafunction does, it only supplies
 the arguments to property, which has to do the actual checking. The
 example should probably do this.
