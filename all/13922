>Release:        5.3.5
>Environment:
Debian GNU/Linux 7.1 amd64
>Description:
The fl+ and fl* procedures are defined by R6RS as always returning flonums. In Racket these currently return the exact integers 0 and 1 respectively.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program with plt-r6rs:
(import (rnrs))
(assert (and (flonum? (fl+))
             (flonum? (fl*))))
(display "ok\n")
