 Hi Ian, my (apparently silly) assumption was that on-release would be a supplement to on-key. Thanks for pointing out silly this is. -- Matthias

 Not sure what assumption was silly, but I was actually pleased when
 holding down a key, there are many on-key events but (I presume) only
 one on-release event.  So using on-release can be a lightweight hack
 for slowing down certain events w/o the students needing to keep track
 of that add'l bit of info.
