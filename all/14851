 Maybe there is a missing call in either read-bytes or write-bytes that
 yields to other threads?
 
 (It doesn't appear to be the ports, since I don't see any IO and no
 GUI callbacks are being handled.)

 To Robby,
 
 Isn't this process fairly sequential though? Unless you're saying it's
 not yielding to the GUI of DrRacket. But, I thought GUI windows in
 Racket are threaded and yielding.

 I am saying there is probably a bug in the implementation of one of the
 primitives your program uses. And those primitives are implemented at a
 sufficiently low level that bugs in them can cause Very Bad behavior
 indeed.
 
 I guess it is a simple fix, tho, once
 Someone knowledgable (cough, Matthew, cough) has a chance to take a look. :)

 To Robby,
 
 I think my initial statement may be a bit misleading. If one decreases
 the size of bytes to read from 5MB to 5KB, the GUI doesn't hang.

 I understand. I believe that supports my theory.
 
 There may be multiple bugs tho.

 If I add
 
  (require racket/gui/base)
  (parameterize ([current-eventspace (make-eventspace)])
    (queue-callback (lambda ()
                      (define f (new frame [label "clock"]))
                      (define m (new message%
                                     [parent f]
                                     [stretchable-width #t]))
                      (send f show)
                      (let loop ()
                        (send m set-label (~a (current-milliseconds)))
                        (sleep 0.1)
                        (queue-callback loop #f)))))
 
 to the beginning of the program, then the clock keeps ticking and I can
 click the "Close" button (while DrRacket itself seems stuck), so I
 don't think it's a problem at the level of primitives.

 To Robby,
 
 I added a yielding thread to the code to see if it made any difference,
 cpu usage is now 100% and it is consuming memory (over 700 mb at this
 point). I managed to get output of the 5MB though. It seems somewhat
 slow at writing 5MB of bytes and consumes a lot of memory.

 (thread
    (lambda ()
       (sleep 0)
       (write-bytes (grab-header "/dev/urandom"))))

 Ah, thanks. The bug is in the port implementation. I see it now.

 Well, the fix I ended up pushing brings back interactivity to
 drracket, but the random-bytes case seems to be the worst one. It can
 get as bad as taking a few seconds to process one chunk of 1,000 bytes
 on my machine sometimes. When the bytes are all 'a's, then things are
 better and we seem to stay much closer to 50 or so msec per chunk so
 interactivity isn't horribly broken.

 To Robby,
 
 Is there a way for the GUI to just display the bytes without any
 processing? Why would it take a few seconds to display 1MB?

 Well, the IO implementation in DrRacket is complex partly to
 accommodate showing non-byte values (like images and fractions and
 plots and ... the list goes on) and partly because it is using an
 editor to show the results (which means that the place where they are
 displayed is very flexible and maintains data structures that are
 useful for editing even though the actual output will never be edited)
 and partly because we could work harder.
 
 The short version of the story is that I agree that this seems
 wasteful, but I believe all of the easy fixes have already been done
 and we're left currently with more difficult ones.
