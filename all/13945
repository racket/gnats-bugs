This is odd as find-seconds can create dates as low as 1901 (that is the lowest value i tested) 

This error occured on mac version 5.2.1 and 5.3.5 as well as my windows 8 laptop version 5.3.1. Both are the 64bit versions.

 Does that time actually exist (in your timezone)? Could it have been during
 a leap forward daylight savings hour?

 Apparently March 1st 1903 was when a standard time was adopted in south
 africa: perhaps they had to shave off a few minutes or hours or something
 to make things work, such that midnight on that day never officially
 existed?

 No no, not at all! That function is basically a binary search for the
 inverse function and it finds all kinds of craziness in local timezones. :)
 
 Thanks for using racket and getting in touch.

 IIRC, this is at least the second or third find-seconds error report 
 that has turned out to be a genuine gap in times. The error message 
 should probably be improved. I'll change it.

 Here's the output with my changes for a non-existent date:

 find-seconds: non-existent date
    inputs: (0 0 0 29 2 2001)

    above: 983422800 is (0 0 0 1 3 2001)
