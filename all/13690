>Description:
In BSL/BSL+/ISL (and possibly other student languages), when the implode function is passed a list in which one element is not a 1String, it produces an error message that the first element of the argument list, rather than the entire argument list.  This is misleading when the actual argument happens to be a list of lists.

Better would be to change the error message to "expected a list of 1-letter strings, but received: LS" where LS is the actual input list, or to say "...but encountered this item in the input list: X" where X is not a 1String.
>How-To-Repeat:
(implode (list (list "a" "b")
               (list "a" "b")
               (list "a" "b")))
>>>
implode: expected a list of 1-letter strings, but received: (list "a" "b")
