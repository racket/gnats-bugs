 Why do you expect it to?

 The behavior is pretty different in these cases from other
 identifiers.  For example, if you have this in the definitions window:
 
 #lang racket
 
 modulo
 lambda
 
 If you hit C-/ with the cursor at the end of `modulo', it displays a
 single-element completion list, with just `modulo'.
 
 If you hit C-/ with the cursor at the end of `lambda', it displays a
 very long completion list starting with `!' and `!!'.  If you chose
 one, you get a nonsense identifier like `lambda!!'.
 
 The same thing happens with `define' as with `lambda'.  If the
 identifier is not the prefix of any completion, it displays "no
 completions available".  However, with `defxyz', it displays all
 possible identifiers as completions.
