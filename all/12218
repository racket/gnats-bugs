>Description:
The documentation for add-curve and scene+curve says that add-curve does not crop the image if the added curve extends beyond the background's borders.  However, it appears to only expand the image if the curve's endpoint coordinates are outside of the background's borders, and it crops off any portion of the curve between the endpoints that extends beyond the background (or further out than the curve's endpoints, if they're beyond the background's boundaries).
>How-To-Repeat:
This expression should, according to the docs, produce an image in which the curve extends outside of the rectangle (and is not cropped off):
(add-curve (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "cyan")
           20 20 0 3
           180 180 0 3
           "blue")
Part of the curve is cropped off, and it does not seem to matter whether the background was created by rectangle or by empty-scene.

 The cropping is happening by the printing, I think.
 
 Try overlaying it on something big.

 Yes, this prevents the cropping:
 
      (require picturing-programs)
 
      (overlay (add-curve (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "cyan")
                   20 20 0 3
                   180 180 0 3
                   "blue")
               (rectangle 300 300 "solid" "gray"))
