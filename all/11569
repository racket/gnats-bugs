>Description:
Run this program and select A in the combo field's popup menu.  In the interactions window, "Selected: A" prints out.  Open the popup menu and select A again.  It won't print again.  I can't find anything in the documentation suggesting that multiple selections of the same item will ignore its callback, and I need some method of detecting what was selected even if it matches the previous selection.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define f
  (new frame%
    [label "The Frame"]))

(define p
  (new combo-field%
    [label #f]
    [parent f]
    [choices null]))

(for ([s (in-list '("A" "B" "C"))])
  (new menu-item%
    [label s]
    [parent (send p get-menu)]
    [callback
     (lambda (i e)
       (printf "Selected: ~a\n"
         (send i get-plain-label)))]))

(send f show #t)

 FWIW, this suggests that maybe you want a button% instead of a choice%
 (or maybe a combination of the two). I could be completely wrong, tho.
 But maybe if you wanted to describe the user interaction someone might
 be able to suggest something.
