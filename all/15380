 Hi Richard,
 
 I can reproduce this error only if I set DrRacket's language options to
 enable "Debugging and Profiling". As a workaround while we investigate,
 try setting the option instead to "Debugging". That should make the
 error go away.

 Hi Richard,
 
 I just pushed a fix, which should land in tomorrow's nightly builds, and
 be included in Racket 6.8 (planned for January).
 
 Thanks for the report!
