>Description:
Right now DrRacket depends on libjpeg62. libjpeg8 is available on newer systems, sometimes by default. DrRacket (or whichever component is responsible) should be able to use libjpeg8 as well.

Specifically the upcoming Precise ubuntu distro has libjpeg8 installed by default but not libjpeg62 (although it can be installed with the package manager).
