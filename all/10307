>Description:
Tried many versions of PLT Scheme, unable to get it to load. Perhaps it won't run on old G3 ibooks?

Icon bounces a few times in the dock, then quits.

Ran it from the CLI, no dice, get this:

Computer:~ user$ /Applications/PLT\ Scheme\ Full\ v4.2.0.4/DrScheme.app/Contents/MacOS/DrScheme 
dyld: incompatible cpu-subtype
Trace/BPT trap
>How-To-Repeat:
Just open up the terminal, find the DrScheme file, run it. No dice.

Reason>>> Please test with a recent DrRacket, as many aspects of the
GUI system have changed.
