>Description:
Dunno whether this is a bug in RackUnit or the docs, but there are a bunch of exported forms in the rackunit module that don't show up anywhere within the documentation: test-false, test-equal?, and so on.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following in an empty definitions window:

#lang racket

(require rackunit
         rackunit/text-ui)

(run-tests
 (test-suite "sample tests"
   (test-equal? "sample test 1" 3 4)
   (test-equal? "sample test 2" (cons 3 4) (cons 3 4))))

Hit Run.  The tests compile and run; you'll get a diagnostic indicating that the first test case fails but the second succeeds.

Now open the documentation and search for test-equal? -- no hits.  You'll also find that the string "test-equal?" doesn't appear in the Racket documentation at all.  Apparently, neither does any text indicating the existence of forms combining test-case with check-equal? et al.

Is this just a shortcoming in the documentation, or should I not be using these forms?

 Apparently test-equal? is a synonym to check-equal?. (I'm not sure the
 rationale behind the missing documentation.)

 They aren't synonyms; test-equal? wraps check-equal? in a test-case 
 expression. (See define-shortcut in rackunit/private/test.)
 
 I'll update the docs.
