>Description:
Not really a bug, rather a suggestion.

In PLoT: Graph Plotting, it is stated that the function `plot' (and others) returns a `snip%'.
It would be more precise and useful to state that it returns an `image-snip%' instead (so that it is easy to find that (send a-plot-snip get-bitmap) can be used for example).
I had to look at the module code to find it out.

Best regards.
