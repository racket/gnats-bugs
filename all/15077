>Description:
In the Iteration Performance section under Iterations and Comprehensions in The Racket Guide:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/for.html#%28part._for-performance%29

stop-before and stop-after are both listed under fast-indexed-seq and fast-parallel-seq. This suggests that stop-before and stop-after can produce a multi-value sequence. Experimentation and looking at their doc-pages seems to show that they only ever produce 1-value seqs.

Please fix this in docs!

(If I am wrong and they can produce multi-value seqs, clarify this in the docs!)
