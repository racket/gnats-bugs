Neil Toronto has his own version of for/vector: that should work.

 Vincent and I are going to push it soon, along with for*/vector:, 
 for/flvector:, and for*/flvector:. The failing example is flawed, 
 though; it should be
 
 #lang typed/racket
 (for/vector: : (Vectorof Natural) ([i : Natural (in-range 20)]) i)
