 If you paste that command into a shell window, what output do you get?

 the browser comes up - I've done it with chromium, google chrome and firefox
 
 I just took the pop up error message
 
 browser-run: process execute failed: '("/usr/bin/chromium-browser
 file:///home/sam/COMPILES/rkt6.3/doc/sxml/sxpath.html#(def._((lib._sxml%2Fmain..rkt)._sxpath))")
 
 and edited it down for the command line
 
 /usr/bin/chromium-browser
 'file:///home/sam/COMPILES/rkt6.3/doc/sxml/sxpath.html#(def._((lib._sxml%2Fmain..rkt)._sxpath))")'
 
 
 and the browser came up

 I can't reproduce this on my Linux system.
 
 Sanjeev: Did you add a space after "/usr/bin/chromium-browser"? If you
 don't, then the command and the argument won't be separated, which would
 trigger the error you saw.
