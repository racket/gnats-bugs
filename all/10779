>Description:
When arrow contracts have a defined name, functions wrapped in that contract inherit that name.  This is often misleading; a function is not a contract.

In the example program below, there is a contract named "a-contract-that-is-not-a-function", a function named "add1" (primitive), and the wrapped version named "a-function".  When "a-function" is printed, it shows up as "#<procedure:a-contract-that-is-not-a-function>".

I would prefer a name that describes the result as a function, possibly mentioning that it is wrapped by a contract, and possibly mentioning either the function or the contract or both by name, e.g.:

wrapped-function
add1/contracted
add1-protected-by-a-contract-that-is-not-a-function
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

(define a-contract-that-is-not-a-function
  (-> integer? integer?))

(define a-function
  (contract a-contract-that-is-not-a-function add1 'positive 'negative))

a-function
