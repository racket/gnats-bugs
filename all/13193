>Description:
The following test program fails to run when executed on a Macbook laptop whose wireless connections are disabled:

    #lang racket/base
    (require racket/tcp)
    (tcp-listen 8000 4 #t #f)

The error message received is:

    . . tcp-listen: listen failed
      port number: 8000
      system error: Address already in use; errno=48

I can confirm that I get this error message regardless of what port number I use.  The error message is wrong: that port has not been bound.

The error appears to relate to the use of the hostname parameter. If I change the program to:

    #lang racket/base
    (require racket/tcp)
    (tcp-listen 8000 4 #t "127.0.0.1")

then the tcp-listener port opens successfully.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a Macbook laptop, turn off the wireless network.  Then try executing the program:

    #lang racket/base
    (require racket/tcp)
    (tcp-listen 8000 4 #t #f)

You should see the reported error message.

 More investigation.  Something is happening with
 scheme_get_host_address when the network is not up.  I made a small
 change to network.c on my local installation to watch what happens:
 
 diff --git a/src/racket/src/network.c b/src/racket/src/network.c
 index b64d8ca..c10d2a0 100644

      return r;

 I then ran the following test program:
 
     #lang racket/base
     (require racket/tcp)
     (tcp-listen 8000 4 #t #f)
 
 When the wireless network is up, I see the following output:
 
     0 2 1 6
     #<tcp-listener>
 
 
 However, when the wireless network is down, I see a different value
 for the ai_family:
 
     0 30 1 6
     tcp-listen: listen failed
       port number: 8000
       system error: Address already in use; errno=48
       context...:
        /Users/dyoo/test-tcp.rkt: [running body]
 
 
 
 For some reason, it's choosing an entirely different family.  It's
 been years since I looked at the TCP api, so I'm failing to remember
 what's supposed to happen here.

 Can anyone confirm that this is not happening on their systems, even
 Ubuntu linux?  I just ran into a situation on my Ubuntu servers that
 appears to mimic these exact conditions.  I want to make sure I'm not
 chasing the same bug here.
