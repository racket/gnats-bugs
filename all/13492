>Description:
Currently #:kws use the same color and font property settings as parentheses in DrRacket.

This seems wrong to me. My specific issue is that I have set parens to *bold* and now the code looks a lot less readable with all the #:keywords also in *bold*. A better choice IMO is to make them share the settings of symbols.

 Matthew, it looks like you added keyword support back in 2009 and made a
 keyword map to a parenthesis (line 318 of scheme-lexer.rkt).
 
 Do you think adding another lexeme (category?) would break others' code or
 does it seem safe to make that change and then chagne drracket to have
 another configuration color?

 I think you'll need to change `scribble/private/manual-code' to map the
 new category to the current parenthesis/keyword color, but I can't
 think of anything else that is likely to go wrong --- or, at least,
 nothing that I'd be more likely to know about than you.

 I'm not sure, but I think it's probably ok.

 &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew, it looks like you added keyword support back in 200=
