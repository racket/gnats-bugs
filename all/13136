 This is not a bug, since the #lang shorthand only works at the beginning
 of a file as a module declaration. See:
 
   http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/hash-languages.html
 
 If you would like to start the REPL in a particular language, you can
 use something like the following:
 
   racket -I typed/racket
 
 And finally, if your intent was to declare a module at the REPL you can
 do so directly:
 
 -> (module foo racket
      (define x 3)
      (provide x))
 
 Cheers,
