>Description:
DrRacket beachballs very very often; almost every time I click "Run." Sometimes, it beachballs for no apparent reason.

Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. type some code in DrRacket
2. Click "Run"
3. Move mouse
4. Watch mouse turn into a beachball and take sometimes more than a minute to decide it wants to run normal again.

I have a 2010 MacBook, so it's a bit old, but DrRacket is by far the program that beachballs the most.
