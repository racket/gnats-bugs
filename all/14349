>Description:
The following program returns a pict that
draws an image with the following text:
 "application: procedure does not accept keyword arguments 
  procedure: list arguments...: 600 600 #f"

Manually calling creating a pict which uses (send dc draw-bitmap bm x y ...)
provokes the same error.

#lang racket 
(require pict)
(bitmap "foo.jpg")
(bitmap "bar.png")
