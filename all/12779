>Description:
Identified by Laurent on the racket-lang mailing list.  The current parser in scriblib/bibtex does not appear to work under the following case:

(define text (open-input-string "@article{hochreiter_long_1997, 
    author = {Hochreiter, S. and Schmidhuber, J.}, 
    title = {Long {Short-Term} Memory}, 
    volume = {9}, 
    number = {8}, 
    journal = {Neural Computation}, 
    year = {1997}, 
    pages = {1735--1780} 
} "))

(bibtex-parse text)


I think there's a missing call to slurp-whitespace after the use of read-value:


kui ~/local/racket/collects/scriblib $ git diff bibtex.rkt 
diff --git a/collects/scriblib/bibtex.rkt b/collects/scriblib/bibtex.rkt

 Ah!  The documentation in:
 
     http://artis.imag.fr/~Xavier.Decoret/resources/xdkbibtex/bibtex_summary.html
 
 offers an explanation of the file format.  Revisions to the bibtex
 parser should satisfy its examples.

 FWIW, Danny's patch worked for me.
 
 And while you're at patching the bibtex.rkt file (sorry to hijack the bug
 thread; Should I make a separate report?), it would be wonderful if the
 file could also export `path->bibdb' and `(struct-out bibdb)'.
 I need these because I don't use the scribble facility, but only the bibtex
 parser (for slideshow output).
