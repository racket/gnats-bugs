>Description:
If you delete a file that is being edited in DrRacket, bad things
happen when an autosave occurs: a "warning" is issued and the 
buffer goes blank, at which point DrRacket seems to be in some
bad state.  Pressing Save will actually save the contents of 
the file (despite the fact they are no longer visible), but 
that will have no effect on DrRacket: the save button remains,
the buffer is still blank, etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a buffer, Save As "try.rkt"
Externally delete try.rkt
Edit the try.rkt buffer
Wait for auto-save to occur:

Error autosaving "/Users/dvanhorn/try.rkt".
Autosaving is turned off
until the file is saved.

file-creator-and-type: could not access file (-43): #<path:/Users/dvanhorn/Desktop/today-client.rkt>

At which point the definitions window is wiped out.

 One problem with this is that the file-creator-and-type function is
 raising an exn:fail? when the code expects an exn:fail:filesystem?.
 
 > (with-handlers ((exn? values)) (file-creator-and-type "dne.rkt"))
 (exn:fail
  "file-creator-and-type: could not access file (-43): \"dne.rkt\""
  #<continuation-mark-set>)
 
 The docs don't say what the right exception is; I'd like to avoid
 catching errors like this one, if possible:
 
 > (with-handlers ((exn? values)) (file-creator-and-type #f))
 (exn:fail:contract
  "file-creator-and-type: expected argument of type <path string>; given #f"
  #<continuation-mark-set>)
 
 So I'm wondering whether or not the current behavior is intended?
