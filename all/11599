>Description:
The mouse leave event can be delayed until the mouse re-enters a canvas% object if a message-box is involved.

To see, run the program below, move into the blue square with the mouse, click, release, see the message box, move out of the blue square, dismiss the message box (I used the space bar), and then see no printf saying "got leave". 

Now move back into the canvas, and you see the leave event, as well as the enter event, right in a row.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define pref-save-canvas%
  (class canvas%
    (define/override (on-event evt)
      (unless (send evt moving?)
        (printf "got ~s\n" (send evt get-event-type)))
      (when (send evt button-up?)
        (let-values ([(cw ch) (get-client-size)])
          (when (and (<= 0 (send evt get-x) cw)
                     (<= 0 (send evt get-y) ch))
            (message-box "hi" "prefs stats")))))    

    (define/override (on-paint)
      (define-values (cw ch) (get-client-size))
      (define dc (get-dc))
      (send dc set-brush "blue" 'solid)
      (send dc set-pen "black" 1 'transparent)
      (send dc draw-rectangle 0 0 cw ch))

    (inherit get-dc flush get-client-size min-width min-height)
    (super-new [stretchable-width #f]
               [stretchable-height #f]
               [style '(transparent)])
    
    (min-width 20)
    (min-height 20)))

(define f (new frame% [label ""]))
(define c (new pref-save-canvas% [parent f]))
(send f show #t)
