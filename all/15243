>Description:
Hello, my interactions window seems to be disabled. At first a message popped up saying there's not enough memory, so I allowed it to increase memory, but that didn't help anything. Now nothing pops up, but a message pops up on the interactions window saying that the interactions window is disabled. I'm not sure if the problem is my computer or not. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I just wrote some definitions and tried to run them.
