 This looks like the correct error message to me. This program has the same one:
 
 #lang racket
 
 (define (average l0)
   (define-values (count sum)
     (for*/fold  ((c  0) (s  0))
       ((l  l0) (x  (in-value (string->number l))))
       #:when (and (real? x) (>= x 0))
       (values (+ c 1) (+ (cast x Real) s))))
   (if (= count 0) 0.0 (/ sum count)))
 
 
 The `#:when` needs to be inside the () for the sequences.

 I don't think #%datum is a good way to signal the error. But yes, it's not a type error but an error in the for/ expansion. 
 
 All of this came about because of a type error that was unacceptable, then a var.ty error (which someone else reported). Of course I cannot reconstruct the type error that originally bugged me. 
 
 [But thanks for making the occurrence typing for #:when work out just fine.]

 Racket sees this the same as this expression currently:
 
  (let () #:x 1)
 
 are you saying that 'for' should check the first part of its body to
 make sure it isn't a keyword? (seems overly specific).

 I think #%datum should not print itself in these situations. 
 
 This is what we get: 
 
 stdin::9: #%datum: keyword used as an expression
   in: #:x
   context...:
 
 This is what would be nice: 
 
 stdin::9: keyword used as an expression
   in: #:x
   context...:
 
 Indeed, I will generalize this claim: No #% should ever show up in an error message.
