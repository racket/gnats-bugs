>Description:
Save the file below as "foo.scrbl", then run "raco scribble foo.scrbl", and open foo.html in your favorite web browser; I tried Firefox 3.6.13 and Safari 5.0.3 and got the same results on both.  Notice that the lines in the output are reversed.

Both pretty-print and pretty-print-handler work correctly on this list at the DrRacket repl.
