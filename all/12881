>Description:
Joe Snikeris has the following feedback for the Continue tutorial:


- In section 4, "Rendering HTML" there is an exercise that involves
revising render-post to show the number of comments attached to a
post. At this point in the tutorial, the 'post' structure does not
have a comments field.

- In section 7, "Share and Share Alike" a 'blog' structure is
mentioned as if it were discussed previously.

- Also in section 7, substitute "posts" for "post" in "whose intended
side effect is to extend a blogâ€™s post."
