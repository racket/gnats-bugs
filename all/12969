>Description:
TR's optimizer confuses unsafe-vector-ref and unsafe-vector*-ref, and correspondingly the set! procedures.

I think this is because they got switched early after their introduction so as to not break any code using unsafe-vector-ref.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module a racket
  (define v (vector 1 'a))
  (provide v)) 

(module b typed/racket
  (require/typed 'a
        (v (Vectorof Symbol)))
  (: i Fixnum)
  (define i 0)
  (: x Symbol)
  (define x (vector-ref v i)) 
  (provide x))

(require 'b)
x



=>

TR opt: tmp.rkt 13:12 (vector-ref v i) -- vector partial bounds checking elimination
x4: broke its contract
  promised: Symbol, produced: '#(1 a)
  in: Symbol
  contract from: b
