>Description:
I saw an error like this a few days ago, but it was in a large project. 

"exception raised by error display handler: normalize-path: #<path:C:/var> (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist; original exception raised: module: duplicate definition for identifier"

This is the minimal example to reproduce the error.

I guest that the problem is that a .zo exist for an older version of a file that now doesn't compile. The error disappears if I delete all the .zo files.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Create two directories "\dir" and "\dir\subdir" with the files:
;--FILE: dir\def-one.rkt
#lang racket/base
(provide (all-defined-out))
(define (one) 1
#;(define (one) 1) ;duplicated

;--FILE: dir\subsir\one.rkt
#lang racket/base
(require "../def-one.rkt")
(one)

2) Add a "compile.ss" files to each directory
;--FILE: dir\compile.ss 
#lang racket/base
(require compiler/compiler)
(require setup/getinfo)
(compile-directory-zos (current-directory)
                       (get-info/full (current-directory)))

;--FILE: dir\subdir\compile.ss 
#lang racket/base
(require compiler/compiler)
(require setup/getinfo)
(compile-directory-zos (current-directory)
                       (get-info/full (current-directory)))

3) Run the "dir\compile.ss" to compile and create the .zo files

4) Edit the file "dir\def-one.rkt". Remove the #; so the definition of "one" is duplicated, and save the file.  

5) Run the other "dir\subdir\compile.ss" to compile and create the .zo files only in the subdir.

6) Get the ERROR: exception raised by error display handler: normalize-path: #<path:C:/var> (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist; original exception raised: module: duplicate definition for identifier

To repeat:

+7) Edit "dir\def-one.rkt" to make it a valid file. Add again the #; and save

+8) Run "dir\compile.ss" to compile everithing.

+9) Edit "dir\def-one.rkt" to make it a invalid. Remove the #; or add or remove a random ( or ).

+10) Run again "dir\subdir\compile.ss" to get the error.

 I believe that this bug was fixed a week or two ago.  Can you try this
 with a nightly build [1] and see if it still happens?
 
 Thanks!

 Thanks for the feedback, Gustavo.
 
 I'll close the bug.

 OK. I tested my example in plt-5.2.1.6-bin-i386-win32.exe (nightly,
 2012-02-23).
 
 With the incorrect program and I got the error:
 
 ERROR: . ..\def-one.rkt:7:9: module: duplicate definition for identifier in: one
 
 that is the expected error. :)
