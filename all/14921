>Description:
Under some circumstances, switching away from and then back to a maximized DrRacket window can cause a cycle of switching rapidly from one DrRacket window to the other and back.

This may actually be an OS X bug, but I haven't managed to reproduce it in a different app yet; e.g., Mail behaves fine under similar circumstances.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open two windows.
Maximize one.
Switch to another app (Cmd+Tab).
Switch back to DrRacket. The problem MAY occur at this step.
If not, use the "Windows" menu to switch to the maximized window.
