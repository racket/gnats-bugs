>Description:
I'm working with the racket handin server trying to figure out what I did to install it successfully.  I find myself with a package installed that I cannot get rid of.

raco pkg show   tells me there is no package

raco link -l    tells me there is no collection

raco setup -v -c -l tufts-comp50-2013f    reports deleting the collection

and yet, the directory is still sitting in my ~/.racket, and the extra icons, buttons, menu entries, and what have you are still in my DrRacket on launch.


Questions:

  - What is /home/nr/.racket/5.3.6/collects/tufts-comp50-2013f ?
  - What is the approved command-line method of discovering its existence?
  - What is the approved method of removing it?

And a question I wish were addressed explicitly in the documentation: if I install a package, collection, or plt file, and I subsequently regret my action, how can I restore the status quo ante?

 Just to follow up, after using the big hammer (rm -rf),
 I've learned that after
 
         raco link -i handin-tufts-comp50-2013f
 
         raco setup handin-tufts-comp50-2013f
 
 and 
 
     drracket
 
 I installed a broken tool, but after
 
         raco link -r  handin-tufts-comp50-2013f
 
         raco setup -v -c -l handin-tufts-comp50-2013f
 
 I *still* have a broken installation.  find(1) reports that the
 *tufts* files are gone, but launching drracket results in
 
     Error invoking tool
     #<path:/home/nr/cs/50/grades/handin50/handin-tufts-comp50-2013f>;"client-gui.rkt"
 
     collection-path: collection not found
       collection: "handin-client"
       in collection directories:
        /usr/local/lib/racket/pkgs/installed/handin
        /home/nr/.racket/5.3.6/collects
        /usr/local/lib/racket/collects
 
 So I am still looking for a way to restore the status quo ante after a
 botched installation.

 `raco setup -c` doesn't delete the collection. It just "cleans" by
 deleting compiled files in the collection.
 
 Did you create a ".plt" file, such as "tufts-comp50-2013f.plt", and
 then install that with "Install .plt File..." in DrRacket? That's the
 most likely way to end up with the directory that you report.
 
 In that case, there isn't a readily available uninstall operation or
 good reporting about the collection directory --- which are among the
 reasons that we're moving away from the ".plt" style of distribution
 and toward packages. But you should be able to just delete the
 directory

 You're making a good case that we should delete the non-package
 suggestions in the Handin docs. :)
 
 I'm having trouble making a good guess at your current state. It's
 possible that
 
  raco setup -n -D
 
 will improve things by fixing a mismatch, or maybe it will provide a
 helpful error.

 OK, thanks.

 Among many other activities, yes.

 I'd be delighted to use packages, but the 'Install Package...' entry
 on DrRacket's File menu seems not to provide for installing a package
 from the Web.  Hence my use of a .plt file.
 
 I've scrubbed the directory; thanks.

 If my students can install from an http: URL, I'm all for it!

 I flailed around and eventually got things fixed by blowing away a
 cache.rktd file and then re-running raco setup.

 The "install Package..." entry supports /any/ package source. The
 extensive list [1] includes URL pointing to a zip, tar, or plt file.

 Given the different behavior of 'install package' vs 'install plt',
 you might have a wee usability problem...

 We absolutely do. We're in a transition phase and all indications are that 'install by package' will be the future and a good one too.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Mon, 21 Oct 2013 10:06:24 -0400
Reason>>> .plt file installation is not intended to have an "uninstall" 
operation.
