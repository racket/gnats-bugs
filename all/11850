>Description:
I cannot get syntax-local-lift-require to bind the same names a #%require normally would.  I have provided a sample program below that uses syntax-local-lift-require fairly straightforwardly, and produces an unbound identifier error.

The only place in the collections that uses syntax-local-lift-require is local-require in racket/private/reqprov.rkt.  That macro forces the names to be bound appropriately by explicitly renaming each and every import to a fresh identifier constructed with gensym and syntax-local-get-shadower.  I hope every macro that uses syntax-local-lift-require doesn't have to do that.  (And if syntax-local-lift-require does get changed, local-require can probably be simplified.)

  (require

      racket/require-transform))

    (syntax-parser
      [(_ raw-spec e)
       (with-syntax ([e* (syntax-local-lift-require #'raw-spec #'e)])
         #'(#%expression e*))])))

(module exporter racket/base

 Use `syntax-local-introduce':
 
        (with-syntax ([e* (syntax-local-introduce
                           (syntax-local-lift-require 
                            #'raw-spec 
                            (syntax-local-introduce #'e)))])
           ....)
 
 Meanwhile, I'll figure out what the docs need to say.
