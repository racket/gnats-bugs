I wanted to include a spanish name in my current article written using Scribble. The name has a ñ (tilde n) character, and displays correctly with the HTML backend of Scribble. However, the PDF backend displays Ã± as if the character had been converted once too many from latin1 to utf8.

Use ñ in a Scribble document. Compile with PDF output.

 What document style are you using (as selected by the `scrrible'
 language variant, usually)? There was a problem with variants like
 `scribble/lncs' as of v5.3, and those have been fixed in v5.3.0.23, but
 maybe I've missed one.
 
 Is the "ñ̃" in your document source in composed form (i.e., represented
 as a single code unit) or decomposed form (i.e., two code units: a
 combining tilde plus plain "n")? The PDF back-end via Latex expects
 composed forms, and probably the renderer should normalize explicitly.
