>Description:
This came up with my IRC bot "rudybot" ... some evildoer had it eval some code that called place-channel-put a bunch of times.  I think the racket process ran out of memory.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ git clone git://github.com/offby1/rudybot.git
$ cd rudybot
$ git checkout repro
$ ./servers.rkt

I see 

2011-10-11T01:36:10Z Doing for n: eval ("(for" "([i" "(in-range" "999999999)])" "(place-channel-put" "b" "(list" "1" "2" "3" "4)))")
SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0x7272652f
/bin/bash: line 1: 18058 Aborted                 ./servers.rkt

... although I've tried it three times, and one of those times I merely saw a message about "out of time", which is fine.

 This is probably a duplicate of PR12273, which originates from the
 same evildoer...  (Also CCed.)
