>Description:
`raise-user-error' has a specific intention that racket respects, but drracket doesn't.
It would be nice if drracket did the same: avoid the stacktrace, keep the focus in the
interactions etc.  Maybe just leave the icons, but IMO even that's questionable.

(Some background: I'm writing some examples based on the PLAI introduction to
continuations, which uses `error' to simulate the fact that HTTP is stateless.  This
seemed like a good example for `raise-user-error', but in DrRacket there's no difference
between the two.)
