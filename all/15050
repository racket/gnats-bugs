 Thanks for the report. This is a documentation error that has been
 fixed for the next release.
 
 Here is what the updated docs will look like:

 Thanks!
 
 This was a bug report we filed during a codewalk today in my class,

 I had forgotten we'd fixed this already, but have now pointed them to
 the new docs.
