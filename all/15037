Re:  "An name or a variable is a sequence of characters not including a space or one of the following:"

  Should be (notice change of "An" to "A"):

  "A name or a variable is a sequence of characters not including a space or one of the following:"


Re:  "A boolean is one of: true, false, #t, #f, #true, or #false."

  Should be (notice addition of  "#T, #F, "):

    "A boolean is one of: true, false, #t, #f, #T, #F, #true, or #false."

  Also, consider putting  #true  and  #false  ahead of the abbreviations to emphasize them.


Re:  "A symbol is a quote character followed by a name. A symbol is a value, just like 0 or empty."

  The examples of "just like" are very special, and aren't type-set for "0" being a value and "empty" a variable.
  How about (with the three examples typeset as values):

    "A symbol is a quote character followed by a name. A symbol is a value, just like 123, #true, or "abcdef" are."


Re: "3.1 Pre-Defined Variables [...]"

  These variables are no longer the canonical printed representation so consider showing their values,
   e.g. the way  pi  is shown later in an interaction.


Re: "3.5 Pre-defined Functions"

  This being empty initially confused me. It's presumably a target for the earlier link "pre-defined functions".
  Consider sub-numbering the remaining sections (3.5.1, 3.5.2, etc), or putting in text such as:

    "The pre-defined functions are the ones described in the remaining sections 3.6--3.17."
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to the section  @secref["intermediate" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/htdp-langs/htdp-langs.scrbl")]  and find the text shown after each "Re:" in the Description part of this report.
