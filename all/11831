Computer Language: (("Initial language" "No language chosen") #(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug))
>Description:
On startup when no language is chosen, DrRacket produces the following error message in the interactions window right before the REPL prompt:

write-special: port does not support special values: #<output-port:pipe>

I will reply to this bug report with a screenshot.  If I hit "Run", the interactions window resets to show the appropriate message about the language menu in place of the error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrRacket with no language chosen.  This behavior is consistent on an Intel Mac running version 10.6.7 of Mac OS.
