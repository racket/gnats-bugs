>Description:
The following module will loop forever when run:

    #lang racket
    
    (module+ test
      (require racket/list)
      (define/contract x number? 5))

Removing the `require` line produces an unexpected result too:

    define/contract: not used in definition context in: (define/contract x number? 5)
