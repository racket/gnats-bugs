Hello,

  I have installed the PLT Scheme on my PC with Windows XP (SP3). There was no problem during installation but once I try to run the plt scheme software, its trying to ask me if I would like to debug the program with Microsoft Visual Studio.  I would like to know why usch problem occurs. This is serious for me as I am not able to even start the program after installation..

Please do mail me about any solution you have for this problem. 

Thanking you..
Manoj Kumar.
