>Description:
$ sudo  sh  racket-6.11-x86_64-linux.sh 
This program will extract and install Racket v6.11.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is 505M.

Do you want a Unix-style distribution?
  In this distribution mode files go into different directories according
  to Unix conventions.  A "racket-uninstall" script will be generated
  to be used when you want to remove the installation.  If you say 'no',
  the whole Racket directory is kept in a single installation directory
  (movable and erasable), possibly with external links into it -- this is
  often more convenient, especially if you want to install multiple
  versions or keep it in your home directory.
Enter yes/no (default: no) > yes

Where do you want to base your installation of Racket v6.11?
  (If you've done such an installation in the past, either
   enter the same directory, or run 'racket-uninstall' manually.)
  1 - /usr/... [default]
  2 - /usr/local/...
  3 - ~/... (/home/katz/...)
  4 - ./... (here)
  Or enter a different directory prefix to install in.
