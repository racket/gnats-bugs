>Description:
In my environment, following the STR causes some strange symptoms that I could not find good words for. Unfortunately, screen recording seems to be broken as well, so here is a phone camera recording: https://youtu.be/FcT5RZp0Blg

I suspect this isn't DrRacket's fault... but maybe it is! It only occurs in Wayland, not X.

GNOME version 3.24.2 running on an up-to-date Arch Linux.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run GNOME3 in Wayland mode (ie, the default in recent versions)
2. Open some racket file
3. Hover over some bound name
4. Try to right click the bound name
