 This is because TR has some hacks in it for when certain bindings are
 used directly in an application position. list is among these, and
 because of the hack the instantiation is ignored. I tried removing the
 hack and giving list a better type. This works for a lot of cases but
 it fails in enough that it wouldn't be viable. I filed a bug PR/13009
 with the root issue for the failures, and when that is solved, this
 should follow.
 
 If you really need this the instation to be followed use (#%expression
 list) or any other way of not having the function position be the
 identifier 'list'.

 Fortunately, this ought to be easier to fix than that; I think it's a one
 liner.

 I'm using `inst' on another argument I'm sending to the same function, 
 so I'm good for now. Thanks for the hack, though. :)
