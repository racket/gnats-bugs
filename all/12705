>Description:
Run "racket keel.rkt", where that file's contents come from the steps to reproduce.  When I do that, on OS X and Ubuntu Natty, I see a message about a seg fault.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require scheme/sandbox)

(define sandbox (make-evaluator 'typed/racket))

(sandbox "(define result ((inst call/cc Integer (-> Nothing)) (lambda (x) (lambda () (x 5)))))")
(sandbox "(if (procedure? result) (result) result)")
