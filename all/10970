>Description:
A quick look at url-unit.rkt suggests that chunked encoding is not handled. While the request is sent as HTTP/1.0 and well-behaved services should not send Transfer-Encoding: chunked in response to a regular HTTP/1.0 request, many services are not well-behaved.
>How-To-Repeat:
Get data from a URL served with Transfer-Encoding: chunked. The byte counts are included in get-pure-port, even though they are artifacts of HTTP rather than part of the content proper.
