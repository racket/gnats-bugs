>Description:
Running "raco setup" on an individual collection seems to require that all linked collections be available on the file system, even if some of those collections are not needed at all for the given setup command. Some of my personal collections are kept in an encrypted partition that I usually leave unmounted for security reasons, and it shouldn't be necessary to mount it just to build an unrelated collection. Raco setup should only require that the collections it needs for setup be available at setup time.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create and link some collection A.
2. Create and link some collection B, unrelated to A.
3. Remove A from the file system somehow: unmount its partition, delete the directory, whatever.
4. Run raco setup on B.

raco setup will complain that it can't find collection A.
>Fix:
