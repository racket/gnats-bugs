>Description:
This is most likely a bug with the error reporting on 2htdp/image radial-star. radial-start accepts an integer as its first attribute, if you enter 1 you get an error saying you must pass a value greater than 2. If you enter 2, it will draw an image with no error message. So either the radial-star function needs to be updated to error on number of points equal to 2, or the error message when entering 1 has to be changed to "integer greater than or equal to 2" or "integer greater than 1".
>How-To-Repeat:
(radial-star 1 10 50 "solid" "red")
returns the error "radial-star: expects an integer greater than 2 as first argument, given 1"

(radial-star 2 10 50 "solid" "red")
It draws a 2 pointed star (two triangles sharing an edge pointing away from each other.

The error message when passing a 1 point star says that it expects an integer greater than 2, but accepts 2. It should either error when 2 is entered and both errors for 1 or 2 should read "integer greater than 3" or the error message for a 1 point entry should state "integer greater than 1" or "integer greater than or equal to 2"
