>Description:
When trying to open a file in DrRacket in Linux, I'm getting the following error on the command line:

enum:int->_GtkResponse: expected a known #<ctype:fixint>, got: 4294967293

At this point, the dialog becomes unresponsive, and I have to kill DrRacket.

Changing directories in the dialog works fine; it's just when you try to open a file by double clicking, using the Open button, or typing it into the Location: buffer that it hangs.  I've tried with several different (Racket source) files, and they all seem to have the same result.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open up the open file dialog using GTK

 Based on bisection, this was introduced by 8b8dd77.  To be precise, I =
 know that da2e0e9 is good and b86349a is bad through testing clean =
 builds.  While 8b8dd77 fails to build due to missing the <stdint.h> fix =
 from b86349a, I'm pretty sure that's where the issue lies.

 The problem is that `_fixint' was documented (by my reading) to be like
 `_long', but it was implemented to be like `_int'. I didn't catch the
 difference, and in making other changes I changed `_fixint' to match
 (my reading of) the documentation.
 
 I'll switch the implementation of `_fixint' back to being like `_int'
 and clarify in the docs.
