>Description:
LaTeX macros are a poison of the mind. Unhappily, Scribble doesn't contain enough antidote. Ideally, Scribble should know about not inserting spurious linefeeds where (La)TeX treats them magically (or demonically).

Software is hard. Meanwhile they make soft, wearable, hardware.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file bug.scrbl as follows:
#lang scribble/sigplan @nocopyright
@title{
  Magic
  @;@(when #f "Not")
}
This is a test.

Compile it with scribble --pdf bug.scrbl. It works.
Now uncomment the @(when ...) line... it fails during pdflatex processing, while trying to extract a subtitle from the title.

When you look at the respective latex outputs from scribble --latex, you find that the relevant difference is a linefeed:

-\titleAndEmptyVersionAndEmptyAuthors{Magic}{}{}
+\titleAndEmptyVersionAndEmptyAuthors{Magic
+}{}{}
