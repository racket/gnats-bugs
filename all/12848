 You are using the wrong Programming Language. 
 
 Like many other programming environments (MS Visual Studio, Apple's Xcode) DrRacket works for many languages. One of them is Racket. Then there is a whole series of languages to use for the textbook How to Design Programs. You used one of them. 
 
 If you wish to program in Racket, please set the language via the Language MENU to 
 
   "Use the language declared in the source." 
 
 You should see 
 
  #lang racket 
 
 in the buffer. Then enter the above code. Everything will work fine.
