>Description:
DrRacket fails with the following error message when I try to ask for help if the file is in Text mode.

This happens for example when one opens an Algol60 example, DrRacket goes into Text mode, and the "trap" is set -- no F1 for help.

-- The error message --

backward-match: called on a color:text<%> whose colorer is stopped.
