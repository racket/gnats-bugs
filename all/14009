>Description:
Many students misinterpret the docs for stop-when, thinking that the second argument is the actual last-picture, rather than a function that computes the last picture.

Unfortunately, the error message tells them that the first arg is wrong, when the error is their second argument!
>How-To-Repeat:
;did this in advanced for brevity, but the message is also wrong in BSL
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

 (to-draw (λ (x) (circle x "solid" "blue")))
 (on-tick add1)
 (stop-when (λ (x) (> x 20)) ;first argument is a function!
            (circle 10 "solid" "red"))) ;second arg is wrong

;;gives the error 
;; stop-when: expected a function as first argument; given #<image>
