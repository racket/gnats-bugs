>Description:
The description of the paint-callback of the background-region in the Virtual Playing Cards Library should clarify that the callback is only called on demand and how you can make changes visible immediately.

I propose the following change in "cards.scrbl":

114c114,116
<  before returning.}
---
>  before returning. It is called only on demand. Use @xmethod[window<%>
>  refresh] with the containing @racket[table<%>] object to show changes
>  immediately.}
