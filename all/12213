I cannot get Dr Dracket v 5.1.3 to install on Ubuntu 11.04; i'm pretty new at Ubuntu so i might be doing something wrong but I could not get the default text editor to open the file and the commands

sh filename.sh and
sudo bash filename.sh 

would not open the file either
>How-To-Repeat:
I originally attempted to open the file with the default text editor but it could not even open the file.

So then i tried to enter the command sh filename.sh into the terminal and it gave me the error 

sh cannot open the filename.sh

So next i attempted to enter the command sudo bash filename.sh which gave me the error

sudo bash cannot open the filename.sh

 Hi: I think you will have better luck if you post on the mailing list
 asking about this. Try starting here:
 
   http://racket-lang.org/community.html
 
 and look for the "users" mailing list.
 
 If that doesn't make sense or doesn't work out, let us know here.
 
 Robby

 You need to replace 'filename.sh' with the name of the file you
 downloaded.  In you case, it's probably
 'racket-5.1.3-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu-jaunty.sh' (without the quote
 marks).

 Can you provide the exact command line you used, and the output it produced?

 In that case, you probably aren't in the directory that you downloaded
 the file into.  It might be in the Downloads directory, or in the
 Desktop directory (or somewhere else).

 You should do something like this:
 
 $ cd ~/Downloads
 $ sudo -s
 --- enter your password ---
 # sh racket-5.1.3-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu-jaunty.sh
 --- follow the instructions ---
 #  exit
 $
 
 Apparently you are a Northeastern CCIS student; if that's the case,
 you can come to the systems office and they may be able to help you
 with Ubuntu shell use.
