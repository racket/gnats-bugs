>Description:
Only part of the Racket UI is scaled according to the DPI of my screen. The menu is the ordinary size, but the Racket elements like the "Debug" and "Check Syntax" buttons are very, very small.

This is under GNOME 3.14 on the latest Ubuntu GNOME release. Other applications, such as Emacs and all the GNOME apps, are automatically scaled to fit the DPI.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start a fresh installation of Dr. Racket 6.2 on Linux on a system with a very high resolution. The issue is immediately apparent.
>Fix:
