>Description:
Once get-font-from-user has been executed in a DrRacket window, new fonts added to the system are not detected in subsequent executions of get-font-from-user until DrRacket restarts.

I found this behaviour unexpected: the same program run by Racket from a command prompt sees all defined fonts at the time of execution of get-font-from-user. The cost to rebuild the list is relatively small and the fonts shouldn't be cached.

 
>How-To-Repeat:
In a DrRacket window, execute:

#lang racket/gui

(define frame (new frame% 
                   [label "test font"] 
                   [width 400] 
                   [height 200]
                   ))

(define font (get-font-from-user))

(printf "font: id:~a face:~a family:~a size:~a style:~a weight:~a underline?:~a smoothing:~a size-in-pixels?:~a~n" 
  (send font get-font-id)
  (send font get-face)
  (send font get-family)	 	 	 	 
  (send font get-point-size)	 	 	 	 
  (send font get-style)	 	 	 	 
  (send font get-weight)	 	 	 	 
  (send font get-underlined)	 	 	 	 
  (send font get-smoothing)	 	 	 	 
  (send font get-size-in-pixels)
  )

Add a new font. Re-run the program. Observe new font is not displayed in font list. Restart DrRacket. Re-run program. Observe new font is displayed in font list.

 JFYI, the decision to cache the font list is made by the Pango library
 that `racket/draw' uses to handle text and fonts. Although we're not
 shy about fixing serious problems in Pango, a problem at that level is
 harder to fix, and this particular problem will likely get low
 priority.
