The new yellow popup is very nice, and I like the "x" icon to close it.
But being able to close it is not nearly as useful if it keeps popping up!
I'd expect it to have the same semantics as the old warning text: pop it up
only once if the option to warn only once is selected.  Without that, that
option has no use at all.

I'd further suggest getting rid of that option anyway, and have the
pop-up-once behavior be the default.  Since the popup require intentional
action to remove, you already are aware of the change and don't need
another reminder.

 BTW, another option to make this un-ignorable for situations like the
 student languages is to just not have the "x" icon.  Other than that,
 the current "x" icon is making very little sense (as in, "I way to
 temporarily get more space to see more lines").

 If the yellow were a part of the (I know it's overfilled) status bar,  
 I'd like it to pop up every time.
 
 Leave it as is. (Even though I had the same reaction as Eli I think  
 students need to see this more than once.)

 Just to be sure it's clear, my opinion is that having it pop up after
 you explicitly remove it *is* a bug.  Even with students I'd classify
 it as a bug, but a *much* better solution is to have no close icon for
 them.

 Here is my preferred behavior:
 
   RUN
   modify def area
   interact
   yellow
   x
   interact
     no yellow
   RUN
   modify def area
   interact
   yellow
