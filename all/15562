>Description:
It is easy to expect that the expression (quote    (1 2 3)) is same with (quote (1 2 3)).

However, it needs some time looking up references to understand that the expression '   (1 2 3) is same with '(1 2 3), from "When the reader encounters ', it recursively reads one datum and forms a new list containing the symbol 'quote and the following datum. This convention is mainly useful for reading Racket code, where 's can be used as a shorthand for (quote s)." (https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/reader.html#%28part._parse-quote%29)

Although it is not a bug, I would hope some more explanation included in the documentation about that.

Thanks for pretty Racket language.
