I am pretty sure the problem with 'listof' is the capitalization 
because it does have a (deftech "Listof") and I don't know how 
to grep for all possible permutations.

 I don't think it's capitalization, because `deftech' and `tech'
 case-fold the key. (I'll fix the docs, whcih don't mention
 case-folding.)

Reason>>> Matthew reminded me of the docs for deftech and tech and after re-reading it, I could fix my problems. 

After an hour or so of search-and-destroy, I was able to eliminate all broken techs by un-normalizing the strings and a few other guesses. 
That's for about a dozen or so problems. 

I wonder whether it is a good idea for deftech and tech to normalize their strings. So while I am closing the change request, I propose to keep 
in mind that errors should be reported in terms of surface syntax as much as possible.

Reason>>> matthias closed
