>Description:
When the online compilation shows an error in file x, which is caused by an required file y, and then you correct this error in the file x, it still appears in file y.

Running the file successful doesn't remove the error-message, only to click on the X or make an other error in the file removes the message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Two files:

file x:
(define x 3)

file y:
(require "x.rkt")
(+ x 1)

The online compilation shows y.rkt:5:3: x: unbound identifier in module in: x

Switch to file x, add the
(provide x)

Switch to file y. The online-compilation error still exists, while you can run x.rkt without any problems.

 Just to confirm: the error message goes away when you edit the first
 file, right?

 Oh... yes, indeed!
 But it doesn't go away if you only click in the editor, scroll or click on "Jump to error".

 Thanks.
 
 I know I need to fix that. Since you noticed, here's what I had in mind:
 
 When drracket is expanding your program, it tracks which files are
 open in drracket at the moment the compilation starts. Then, as files
 are require'd, it tracks which of them this program depends on. Then,
 when one of those files are edited, drracket notices that and, next
 time the original file gets the keyboard focus (by being clicked on,
 or made the active tab, etc.) the online compilation restarts right
 away, without waiting for an edit.
 
 That would certainly handle this specific use case, and it seems
 reasonably robust.

 It turns out that this program:
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (require framework)
 
 loads only 500 some files, so it is probably best to just track all of
 the files instead. That way if someone opens a file and edits it after
 the error comes back from online compilation, then it will still be
 noticed. I'll do the "tell other tab it needs to be recompiled" after
 each save, tho, instead of after each edit, tho, since it seems
 unnecessary to actually use the contents of other files that haven't
 been saved yet when doing online compilation (i.e., the latest version
 on the disk seems to be what people expect to "count", so lets stick
 with that).
 
 Anyways, lets give that a try and see how it pans out.
