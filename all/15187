>Description:
After upgrading to Racket v6.3, I noticed the DrRacket instance I keep running in the background was always in OS X's list of apps using significant energy, and that my Macbook Pro was heating up a bit. The OS X Activity Monitor says DrRacket v6.3 always has 'Yes' in the 'Requires High Perf GPU' column, and this seems to be the main energy profiling difference between 6.2.1 and 6.3. The difference in energy draw was noticeable for me; it might be even more noticeable for newer Macbooks that automatically switch from integrated to discreet graphics when applications like DrRacket request it.

Some additional hardware info in case this can't be reproduced:
Mid-2009 Macbook Pro
2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo
8GB RAM
NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics
NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT discreet graphics
No automatic GPU switching; I'm running DrRacket and the rest of my applications entirely off the integrated 9400M.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrRacket v6.3 on a computer running OS X. I use 10.11.1.
2. Do work (son) for an appreciable amount of time; write code in DrRacket, switch between DrRacket and other applications, and perform other relatively low-impact routine actions.
3. Check your Activity Monitor and list of apps using significant energy in the menu bar. DrRacket will have 'Yes' in its 'Requires High Perf GPU' column in Activity Monitor, and may show a higher than normal Average Energy Impact because of it.

 The difference relative to v6.2.1 might be a performance regression in
 the way v6.3 refreshes windows. The problem is specific to El Capitan,
 and we discovered and repaired the problem only in the last couple of
 days.
 
 Can you check whether a recent development snapshot behaves more like
 v6.3 or v6.2.1?

 I gave 6.3.0.7--2015-11-26(e9282d4/a) a try. Actual battery impact seems to be identical to v6.2, but because the DrRacket process always has Requires High Perf GPU selected, it’s still always listed as a process using significant energy and may cause unnecessary battery drain on Macbooks with automatic GPU switching (more or less anything newer than my model with two GPUs).
 
 I’m very impressed by DrRacket’s low battery impact otherwise though, given how much the IDE does even with background expansion disabled. It’s good to know energy efficiency is important for the Racket developers too.
 
 Hope you have a fantastic Thanksgiving!
