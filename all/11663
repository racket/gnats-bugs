 oh -- and no prompt, ie big-bang does not return.

 I know. I used to ensure the following test
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 (big-bang 0)
 
 to ensure this behavior. That is, if there is no handler and no =
 stop-when and no to-draw clause, big-bang should go into an infinite =
 loop. That's the natural 'limit' behavior of this specification.=20
 
 ;; ---=20
 
 What do you propose should happen w/o special-casing it?=20

 I dont think that an infinite loop is ever diserable behavior (in
 situations like this). How is that helping the student with their
 buggy program?
 
 I think your "without special casing it" caveat is not the right kid
 of thinking.
