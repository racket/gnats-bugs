>Description:
I was trying to get two independent windows from a World program, and got the following unhelpful error message:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.2.3 [3m].
Language: Intermediate Student with lambda; memory limit: 1024 megabytes.
instantiate: unused initialization arguments: (on-draw (list (lambda (a1) ...) 400 200)) for instantiated class: ...htdp/private/last.ss:8:2
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define (render1 n) (text (number->string n) 12 "red"))
(define (render2 n) (text (number->string n) 10 "blue"))

(big-bang 0
          (on-draw render1 200 400)
          (on-draw render2 400 200)
          (on-tick add1))
