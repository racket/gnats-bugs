 I'm not sure what the code is supposed to be doing, but if v = 197 and
 a = 111, then this (in bitmap.rkt):
 
   (unsafe-fxquotient (fx* v 255) a)
 
 produces 452.
 
 I would have thought the proper computation there would be:
 
   v/255 * (1 - a/255)
 
 which is also this:
 
   (v * (255 - a)) / 255
 
 but maybe I got a minus sign wrong and the above should really be this?
 
   (unsafe-fxquotient (fx* v a) 255)
 
 Or maybe it really should be this:
 
   (unsafe-fxquotient (fx* v (- 255 a)) 255)
 
 with the (- 255 a) lifted out, of course?

 Ah.  I didn't understand the representation. Perhaps, then, the font
 drawing code is not putting the right values in, then?

 The problem is that v = 197 and a = 111 makes no sense for
 pre-multiplied alpha ARGB. A should always be at least as large as R,
 G, and B in a pre-multiplied ARGB, right?

 I'm not getting the error. Do you get it when running with a fresh
 DrRacket or Racket?

 Racket. Perhaps only under windows?
