 There is no attached program. Please send it in or let us know whether either of the observations below fix it. 
 
 1. Your language choice suggests that you must have a
 
  (require 2htdp/universe)
 
 line in your program. Do you have one? 
 
 2. Your email suggests that you're a student and so perhaps you meant to be in a student language and select the teachpack. Did you accidentally choose the wrong language?
