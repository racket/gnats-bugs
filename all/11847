>Description:
I'm not sure, but I think that this is a bug:

#lang racket
(require setup/xref scribble/xref)
(define xref (load-collections-xref))
(xref-binding->definition-tag 
   xref 
   (list '(lib "contract.rkt" "racket") '->)
   #f)

=>

car: expects argument of type <pair>; given #<module-path-index>

If I use 'racket/contract, instead of the lib path above, I get the same error.
