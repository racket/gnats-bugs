>Description:
At http://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/metadata.html, some more discussion and examples would be helpful.

For instance, I had tried to do:

#lang setup/infotab
(define deps '(("markdown" "0.1.0")
               "rackjure"))

But pkg.racket-lang.org complained that's a bad deps spec, when I clicked Update Checksums on Manage Your Packages.

When I asked on IRC, Jay was able to figure out that "0.1.0" isn't a "canonical decimal representations", because it ends in ".0".

Also Jay asked me to file this PR. :)

 Matthew,
 
 The dependency well-formed-ness checker calls valid-version? from
 version/utils, which has no documentation and doesn't seem to match
 the intuition that Greg got from reading the metadata page.
 
 Would it be better to document valid-version? and quote it in the
 metadata section or would it better to reimplement the basic checker?
 
 Jay

 I think it would it be better to document `valid-version?' and quote it
 in the metadata section.

 I think we should also support the version spec Greg described.  It's
 certainly something people use a lot in practice in libraries.

 The version collection is dealing very specifically with Racket
 versions (which the docs say too), not with arbitrary versions, so it
 shouldn't be used with package versions.
