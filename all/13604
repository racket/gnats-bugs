I wan't to get Worksheet.Sheets("Sheet1"), but found no way.

There are some tries not work.

  2. > (com-get-property sheets "Item")

 Thank you very much for the report!
 
 We we reimplemented MysterX, `com-get-property' lost the handling of
 list arguments to access parameterized/itemized properties. We have
 restored that behavior for the next release.
 
 Meanwhile, you can use `com-get-property*' from `ffi/com', which takes
 a property name followed by arguments to access a parameterized
 property.

  | ffi/com: repairs, including `mysterx' compatibility
  | 
  | Restore MysterX-style handling of parameterzied properties in
  | `com-get-property'.  It turns out that the original `com-get-property'
  | handles parameterized properties by allowing a list in place of a
  | property-name string, and that handling got lost in the re-write.
  | 
  | Fix the name of `com-get-active-from-from-coclass'.
  | 
  | Fix arity checking for optional arguments.
