 In mathematics a number like 12.34 is the exact number 1234/100.
 However in applications some numbers are exact and others might be inexact
 (found by measurements).
 Scheme and Racket therefore tracks (in)exactness in computations.
 The function inexact->exact converts an inexact number 12.34 into an exact
 number 1234/100 which
 depending on context might be printed as 12.34.
 
 Now you don't say what you expected to be the output, but perhaps you need
 round or floor?

Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Mon, 13 Nov 2017 13:18:57 -0500
Reason>>> This is a misunderstanding of inexact numbers vs exact numbers. Please read docs 
or section 1 (On Numbers) of How to Design Programs (http.org). Exactness is 
unrelated to integerness.
