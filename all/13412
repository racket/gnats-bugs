(struct: (A) node ([value : A] [left : (Tree A)] [right : (Tree A)]) #:transparent)

(: tree-set (All (A) ((Tree A) A -> (Tree A))))

Type Checker: Polymorphic function make-node could not be applied to arguments:
Argument 1:
  Expected: A
  Given:    A2122898
Argument 2:
  Expected: (U (Listof A) (node A))
  Given:    (U (Listof A2122898) (node A2122898))
Argument 3:
  Expected: (U (Listof A) (node A))
  Given:    (U (Listof A2122898) (node A2122898))

Result type:     (node A)
Expected result: (U (Listof A2122898) (node A2122898))
 in: (node y (node-left t) (node-right t))

 I spent some time trying to figure out what the issue is, and it seems that
 it is a problem with subtype and polymorphic application.
 
 At some point (subtype (Listof A) (node A)) is called, which puts these two
 Types in the seen list. During the application of (node A) we end up with
 (struct:<syntax:node> ((U (Listof A) (node a)))), but because it is a union
 type, and union types cannot have overlaps we try to simplify this and
 since these types are on our seen list we instead end up with
 (struct:<syntax:node> ((node a))).
 
 I couldn't figure out any solution though.

 Actually spent some more time on it and have a solution,
