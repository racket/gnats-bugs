>Description:
I know that this has come up a few times, but I think that it's getting
worse:

DrRacket has Enter on the REPL bound to "sometimes evaluate the
expression and sometime insert a newline", which is a little confusing

  (Confusing since when I use pair-inserting of parens (= always) I end
  up not being at the EOL, so I very frequently hit enter, then S-Home
  and delete the newline, then End-Enter.)

The thing that makes it worse is REPLs in browsers, which make the usual
choice more popular: using Enter for sending the expression and S-Enter
for inserting a newline more popular.

There is obviously value in having Enter do the smart
complete-Sexpression thing.  So I think that it could be done with still
being less confusing with:

  * Enter sends the current line *unless* the line is an unterminated
    S-expression (the *whole* line (or lines), including text after the
    cursor).

  * S-Enter always inserts a newline where the cursor is.
