>Description:
Running the code below barfs that | +| is undefined.  Un-commenting the
`rename-out' shows that it's possible to get it bounf.  Also, changing
the space into something else like "\-" in both places makes it work --
so the issue seems to be with `prefix-out' and spaces.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load
(module foo racket
  (provide (prefix-out \  (all-from-out racket))
           ;; (rename-out [+ \ +])
           #%app #%module-begin #%datum #%top))
(require 'foo)
(displayln \ +)

 The second "argument" of prefix-out has the same problem:
 
 #lang racket/load
 (module foo racket
   (define | | 0)
   (provide (prefix-out | | +))
   (provide (prefix-out + | |))
 )
 (require 'foo)
 (displayln | +|)
 (displayln |+ |)
 
 The problem is in [plt]/racket/collects/racket/private/reqprov.rkt in
 the line 1074. It calls something like
     (string->symbol (format "~s~s" '\  '+)) ;==> '\|\ \|+
 but it should call
     (string->symbol (format "~a~a" '\  '+)) ;==> '| +|
 (note: prefix-in already uses "~a~a")
 
 I'm sending a PR to github.
 
 I looked for other similar patterns in the Racket repository:
 http://git.racket-lang.org//plt?a=search&h=b7d2722d7da3db3a664857f7e0854a08abb2f45f&st=grep&s=%7Es%7Es
 
 I think there are other 6 instances that should be fixed:
 [plt] pkgs/redex-pkgs/redex-lib/redex/private/compiler/match.rkt (3 instances)
 [plt] pkgs/redex-pkgs/redex-lib/redex/private/compiler/redextomatrix.rkt
  (3 instances)
 and a few places that should not change.
 
 But I don't know enough about redex to be sure that this is the correct fix.
