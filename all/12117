>Description:
The define-struct implementation in BSL seems to do something that extract-struct-info doesn't like.

In particular, this program:

#lang htdp/bsl
(require racket/match)
(define-struct a (b))
(match (make-a 1)
  [(struct a (b)) b]
  [#f 3])


produces this output:

extract-struct-info: struct-info procedure result not properly formed: '(#f #<syntax make-a> #<syntax a?> (#<syntax a-b>) (#f #f) #t)

These results look okay to me, tho, so I'm not sure what is going on.

(This also fails in BSL+ and ISL the same way)

 The fourth and fifth elements (field accessors and mutators) are
 supposed to have the same length.  I suspect the problem is that they
 don't.

 Oh, right. Duh. I guess the difference is the extra field for
 signatures and that this is just a simple bug.
