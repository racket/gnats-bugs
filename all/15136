Hi,

I don't have access to docs in the latest nightly, when I install it the way I usually do it (unix-style, default directories, uninstall previous version).

`raco docs` does open the web page, but then the search box does not work, so for example if I type "function" in the search box, it shows a page of empty results. Same result for F1 in DrRacket on a keyword.

Also, if I click on any link in the main doc page, I get a 404.
The main page address is:
file:///.../home/lorseau/.racket/snapshot/doc/index.html
And the "Getting started" page is at:
file:///usr/share/racket-6.1.1.8/doc/getting-started/index.html
which does not look consistent.

Thanks,
Laurent

 Did running `raco setup` fix this problem?
 
 Here's my guess:
 
  * You once installed a snapshot v6.1.1.8. Like all snapshots from Utah
    or Northwestern, it claimed the installation name "snapshot".
 
  * You installed a user-specific package with that snapshot --- or, you
    did something that caused a user-specific documentation point to be
    created for the installation name "snapshot".
 
  * You removed the v6.1.18 snapshot and installed a new one. The
    installation process for the new snapshot intentionally does nothing
    user-specific.
 
 At that point, there was an inconsistency. There is user-specific
 information attached to the "snapshot" installation, but the
 installation named "snapshot" is in a new location, and the
 user-specific information was not yet updated.
 
 Running `raco setup` should have fixed the problem (assuming that you
 ran as user "lorseau"), since should update the user-specific
 information for the "snapshot" installation.
