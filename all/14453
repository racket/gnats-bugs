>Description:
Trying to link two units and export renamed bindings, I get a nonsensical error that the rename form is not an identifier. I've provided code that performs as expected as well as a final form that does not.

Minor note: renaming in units is confusingly in the opposite order as require's and provide's rename-in/rename-out. What's up with that?
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(define-signature a^ (foo))
(define-signature b^ (bar))

(define-unit works@
  (import) (export a^) (define foo 'foo))
(define-values/invoke-unit/infer
  (export (rename a^ [qux foo]))
  works@)

(define-unit doesnt@
  (import) (export b^) (define bar 0))
(define-unit work@
  (import b^) (export a^) (define foo bar))
;; Works
(define-values/invoke-unit/infer
  (export a^)
  (link doesnt@ work@))
;; Doesn't
(define-values/invoke-unit/infer
  (export (rename a^ [baz foo]))
  (link doesnt@ work@))
