>Description:
In DrRacket there is a problem completely removing the horizontal scroll-bar from the Definitions window when moving from horizontal layout to vertical layout (i.e. moving from Definitions and Interactions side-by-side to Defintions on top).
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket, move to horizontal layout (ctrl-shft-L).

Navigate to the Definitions window, type a line long enough to require the horizontal scroll-bar to just appear.

Switch to vertical layout (ctrl-shft-L).

Observe partial horizontal scroll-bar in Definitons window. i.e. The space for the scroll-bar is reserved but nothing is painted in it. Further, the text-editor in the Definitions window does not know that the space is reserved, and will paint a line of text behind and be obscured by the horizontal scroll-bar.
