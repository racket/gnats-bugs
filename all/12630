 Actually, it looks like I did push after all. Do you still see this
 problem with commit 36aa2c42d or later?

 The bug report I submitted was running on head as of this morning 8:00am. 
 
 [[In the meantime, I have been trying to roll back to a version that doesn't
 have the bug. Sadly, I ran into another bug with the version I had picked,
 so now I am on my third attempt to get a working dr.]]

 I figured out my problem, and I can replicate the bug, now.
 
 As of last night, it turns out that there were two bugs with the same
 effect. I turned off "populate compiled directories" in DrRacket to fix
 the lower-level bug, but I forgot to try turning the DrRacket option
 back on afterward.

 The program that kills drracket at the moment is this:

 I can't reproduce the (define (f x) …) version that I had earlier. 
 
 But I did notice that the commit is different:
