>Description:
I've been through this way too many times now, so filing up a report, finally.
The problem is that every once in a while I demonstrate some infinite loop in
class, and forget that with debugging on there is a memory problem and very
soon things get stuck.  At some point, DrR will helpfully pop up a dialog asking
if I want to break or kill it (I don't remember what I ask it to do, because at
this point I'm trying to kill it and hit anything that might work).

The thing is that the dialog is supposed to be helpful, yet it's pretty
ineffective since it keeps running -- which results in me clicking the button
a few times, and then I wait a while to see if it responds before I start a
terminal and kill the process from the outside.  I think that it would be much
better to just kill it instead of asking me GUI-ly a question.  Maybe that should
even be the default when there's a memory limit set since for "real" uses it won't
be on?

Alternatively, and even better, it can help to suspend the evaluation thread while
asking the question, but that's probably too hard to do right...

 Do you try typing <menukey>-k instead of using the mouse? That ends up
 being a much more effective way to get input into drracket (fewer
 irrelevant events that have to be processed before the critical one).

 I think that I either use C-b or the button, then after a while the
 popup shows when it can't abort it normally fast enough, or something
 like that.  In any case, my point is that the dialog that suggests to
 kill instead of interrupt the interactions is something that happens
 (at least in my case) in a context where I can't respond to that
 normally, so it's pretty useless to even have that question since I'm
 in a mode of "do whatever it takes to stop it".

 No, it's on.  (And at the default minimum, IIRC, or maybe one step

 Then I think you need to set the memory limit lower. I don't think there is
 anything DrRacket can do to help you when the memory limit is set high
 enough to allow thrashing.

 1. Um, it's very low as is -- 256mb, and since I'm mostly in TR-like
    land, I can't go too low.
 
 2. I just tried it[*], and it didn't do that.  So it might be a result
    of having a few tabs open and/or having gone through a bunch of
    interactions.
 
 3. More: it now actually gets killed (just shows the "interactions
    disabled" thing) with no other notification about what happens.
    (That's a different problem though.)
 
 4. Finally, there is something that could be done when it does happen
    (regardless of the above): take a note of the time, and if the gui
    does not pop up after a while, then just kill the whole thing
    without asking the question.  I'd consider this impolite at times,
    but given that it's already done in some cases (#3) I don't see any
    additional harm in doing that.
 
 5. (As a side-note: even though I can't make it happen now, it is most
    definitely something that happens in class, and relatively
    frequently.)
 
 
 
 [*] FWIW, I tried a few things, and then even the exact same code I
 had in class:
 
   #lang pl broken
   (define (fact self)
     (let ([fact (self self)])
       (lambda (n)
         (if (<= n 1)
             1
             (* n (fact (sub1 n)))))))
   ((fact fact) 5)

 Maybe the memory limit for that one tab's running program plus the other
 tabs and whatnot just for DrRacket are too much memory for your machine or
 perhaps the memory accounting isn't working well enough.

 That's probably because you clicked "don't show me again" on the dialog at
 some point in the past.
 
 Overall, tho, I don't think that this is something that can be fixed at the
 GUI level.
 
 My only recommendation (until something happens better somewhere else) I
 will repeat since I don't feel like you understood it from me before: don't
 click the break button. type <menukey>-k when you want to kill the program.

 Wait, are you implying here that the dialog won't show up when (a) the
 keyboard is used (C-b or C-k), or (b) will it not show up because it's
 a direct "kill" instead of an abort?
 
 (The reason I'm confused is that you mentioned fewer events with the
 keyboard, but a popup is a much more significant jump than "fewer"
 implies.)
 
 In any case, if it's (a) the former, then I'd like an option to not
 have the popup.  But I hope that this is not the case.
 
 If it's (b), then an easy solution is to have an option to make the
 button do a kill.
 
 And I have managed to get to the dialog with:
 
   (parameterize-break #f (sleep 5))
 
 so I see that it's the second click that makes the popup happen.  Why
 not make the second click be a "kill" if it happens shortly after the
 first?  This is something that is done by shell scripts (at least
 bash, I think) where a C-c is usually sent to the running subprocess,
 but hitting it a few times fast kills the script itself.
 
 Something like that would avoid the need for a popup.  At least I
 can't imagine a situation where you would want such a popup if this
 happens.  (Maybe ask on the list?)
 
 (If that doesn't convince you, then I have two other bugs with that
 popup that I see now.  But I'd really much prefer the above behavior
 with no popup.)

 I can make menukey-b, if typed quickly multiple times, kill the program,
 sure. Any advice on actual numbers? If the second one is less than 200 msec
 after the first one?
 
 As for your question at the beginning: (b).

 I always have a memory limit.  It's now at 256mb, and I haven't changed
 it in a long time, but I'm not sure if it was the same back then.  (For
 a while, it had to be bigger to accomodate TR's needs.)
 
 In any case, if a second click is taken as a kill then that's very
 similar to what I wanted, and resolves that problem too.
