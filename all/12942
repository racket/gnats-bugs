 Ah, I never tested this on a Mac.
 
 I meant for the text to be selectable (and not editable) so users could 
 copy and paste the paper reference. On Ubuntu, giving the "Close" button 
 the 'border style also gives it keyboard focus, so it doesn't have the 
 blinking cursor problem.
 
 Question for Matthew: Is giving the "Close" button focus explicitly 
 something the about dialog should have to do, or should the 'border 
 style do that?

 Yes, you need to explicitly give the focus.
 
 As for the blinking caret, you probably want to use the hide-caret
 method or the text:hide-caret/selection-mixin.
 
 But why does the macro stepper have its own about box? (I cannot seem
 to find it.)

 Cool, thanks.

 I thought it would be nice if our tools had references, especially the 
 ones that were the product of someone's dissertation. It gives props and 
 shows users the deep work that goes into Racket.
 
 To see it, click the logo on the upper-right corner of the macro stepper 
 window.

 Ah, I see it now (and yes, text:hide-caret/selection-mixin is what you
 want if you want people to be able to copy and paste; otherwise just
 call hide-caret with #t). The macro stepper icon isn't button-like,
 tho. Maybe you can re-use the button stuff that the main DrRacket
 window's buttons use (switchable-button%)?
