If I Run a file in DrRacket, the Syntax source file information for definitions in that file and in required files is “unsavededitor123456”, even if the file has been saved.

Is this a feature or a bug?
>How-To-Repeat:
Read a file into DrRacket and then Run it.
In the REPL, enter #'foo, where foo is defined in the file.
You will see something like:
#'foo #| unsaved-editor124722:3.4 |#
This was only a problemn because I was testing some syntax processing functions on the very file I was using to develop them.

 The REPL is considered a different "file" than the definitions window.
 If you had put the #'foo in the definitions window and then printed it
 out at the REPL you'd see what you wanted, I think?
 
 Are you seeing that in contexts other than syntax objects that appear
 literally in the interactions window?

 Thank you for the quick response.
 
 That makes sense.  I was thinking of the REPL environment as the same as the definitions window environment, or an extension to it. When I type #’foo, I expected to get the syntax for the foo in the definitions window, but of course the syntax processor is operating on the text in the REPL, creating new syntax.

 (It cannot say the definitions window because the line numbers would overlap)

 Yes, the “unsaved file” text added to the confusion, but the confusion began with me.
