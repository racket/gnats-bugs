>Description:
On the page for the Racket reference on structures, [1] I believe there is a typo in the explanation of how many parameters are required for the constructor of a substructure.

In particular, if you search for the text "of the new fields are automatic", I believe this should simply read "of the new fields are non-automatic" instead.
