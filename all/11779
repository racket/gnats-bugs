>Description:
JPR requested a while back that teaching language primitives 
should be usable with map/fold and friends, which implies on 
empty or one-element lists as appropriate. 

I obliged with small changes to the primitives. 

It would be really neat if 2htdp/image could live up to the 
same expectation. 

I understand this possibly impossible. We don't parameterize
modules and I don't even know what the right parameter is. So
I am filing this as a change request. 
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket 
(require 2htdp/image)
(apply beside (list (circle 3 'solid 'red))) 

should work. It doesn't. It is feasible to work around like this: 

(define BLANK (circle 0 'solid 'red))
(foldl beside BLANK (list (circle 3 'solid 'red)))

 At the moment, 2htdp/image insists on minimal numbers of arguments in
 order to do better error checking in the case that parens are
 unbalanced. Do we not care about that?
 
 Also, you can use empty images in the list so maybe that tempers the
 desire here, at least for fancy users?

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "matthias" by robby at Mon, 28 Feb 2011 19:21:34 -0500
Reason>>> 
I think only Matthias understands this one.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Tue, 01 Mar 2011 09:45:57 -0500
Reason>>> Robby doesn't wish to deal with language design issues via bug reports.
