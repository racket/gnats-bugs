>Description:
Using Linux and Racket v5.3, this hangs after printing up to around 200:

#lang racket
(require racket/gui)

(let loop ([i 0])
    (printf "~a\n" i)
    (sleep 0.01)
    (loop (add1 i)))

This problem does not arise when running inside DrRacket.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ cat test.rkt
#lang racket
(require racket/gui)

(let loop ([i 0])
    (printf "~a\n" i)
    (sleep 0.01)
    (loop (add1 i)))

$ racket test.rkt
