 Hi Emma,
 
 You are correct, the `picturing-programs` package should already be installed.
 
 But you still need to require it in your programs, by using: `(require picturing-programs)`.
 
 Section 1.1.3 of the Picturing Programs textbook discusses this in more detail.
 
 Vincent

 The problem was in her program, not in Racket, as I (and the textbook) explained.
 
 Are you suggesting a change based on this report?
