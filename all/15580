>Description:
I work on a relatively small screen (14 inch 1920x1080), when I tried selecting a language with "Choose language..." I could access all choices, but I couldn't reach the very bottom row where one can select "Show Details...", "Cancel" and "Ok" this row was not visible. I know it is there still as when I move the language selection upwards a bit I can see it, but it jumps down immediately again. Nor can I reach the "Show details..." when using the Tab-key. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Have a 14inch laptop with a 1920x1080 resolution and try Choose Language, then try selecting "Show Details..." 
>Fix:
