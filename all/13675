>Description:
for/flvector, for*/flvector, for/fxvector and for*/fxvector 
are not checking the result-type of the body expression. They instead use unsafe operations to set the vector element to whatever is passed to them. This reults in unexpected or undefined behavior or segfaults. If this is the desired behavior they should be moved to the unsafe section.

Tested with current HEAD
