>Description:
TR special cases (letrec ((var expr)) var), but it is unsound.

The following lets a variable of the type (Pair 'bad 'worse) have the undefined value, and if the commented line is run it results in a segfault.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(require racket/fixnum racket/flonum)

(: f (Pair 'bad 'worse))
(define f
  (letrec ((y y)) y))

(displayln f)

;(car f)
