>Description:
The srfi/19 implementation included in Racket, has the leap seconds table
embedded in the source. This table has not been updated after 2006.

To bring the table up to date, the first lines should be:

(define tm:leap-second-table
  '((1341100800 . 35) ; 2012 JUL 1
    (1230768000 . 34) ; 2009 JAN 1
    (1136073600 . 33) ; 2006 JAN 1
    (915148800  . 32)
    (867715200  . 31)
    ...

What about a function that retrieves the table from usno.mil and
stores it somewhere in the filesystem.

Then the module will load the table from the filesystem, and bomb
if the file is more than 6 months old (leap seconds are announced 
6 months in advance), or automatically attempts to download the 
new file, or direct the user to do the update manually.

========

Also, in the docs for Racket time related function:

"14.6 Time
(current-seconds) → exact-integer?
Returns the current time in seconds since midnight UTC, January 1, 1970."

Actually it doesn't. It returns what it says less the leap seconds:

> (let ((tai (current-tai))
        (racket (current-seconds)))
    (values tai racket (- (truncate tai) racket)))
1356564179.199
1356564144
35.0

Where current-tai is defined as below.
I think this should be mentioned in the docs.

====
(require (prefix-in srfi/19: srfi/19))

(define (current-tai)
  (let ((t (srfi/19:date->time-tai (srfi/19:current-date))))
    (+ (srfi/19:time-second t)
       (* #i1/1000000000 (srfi/19:time-nanosecond t)))))

====

Also, the documentation for seconds->date says:
"Takes secs-n, a platform-specific time in seconds returned by current-seconds,"
which looks odd, since current-seconds documents what it returns in 
platform-independent terms.

 This seems like something DrDr could do by running a test.

 Drdr can ensure that the table is not too old at the moment of the
 release, but the check must be done also at runtime.
 
 Also I retract my suggestion, as it is too simple. It doesn't work for
 long running programs to check the table only at startup. More
 thinking is needed.

 Requiring a network connection at any runtime point can be problematic in
 restricted cases like sandboxed code or having no network, being sensitive
 to future format changes etc. The drdr solution is a good compromise IMO.

 We could also augment that with a mechanism to let people add new
 leap-seconds, perhaps via a parameter, and have an function that returns a
 value that would fit the parameter by making a network connection. That way
 people don't have to upgrade to easily get the latest leap second data.

 This would be good.
 
 At the very least we should get a function to check programmatically
 if the table is stale or good.
 
 A procedure for updating it easily, would be a welcome addition.
 
 And BTW I had missed the most astounding bug in this srfi: time-tai is
 not TAI time!
 It is seconds since 1970-01-01 (real TAI is seconds since 1958-01-01).
  And this is by design.  Sigh.

                                    UTC TIME STEP
                             on the 1st of July 2015
 
 
  A positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2015.
  The sequence of dates of the UTC second markers will be:
 
                           2015 June 30,     23h 59m 59s
                           2015 June 30,     23h 59m 60s
                           2015 July  1,      0h  0m  0s
 
  The difference between UTC and the International Atomic Time TAI is:
 
   from 2012 July 1,    0h UTC, to 2015 July 1  0h UTC  : UTC-TAI = - 35s
   from 2015 July 1,    0h UTC, until further notice    : UTC-TAI = - 36s

 I get 1435708800.  The difference is 5 hours.  Maybe you calculated
 the number for 00:00 in your local time instead of UTC?

 I'll do some reality checking tomorrow... :)

 Oh right I did! I am glad that I wasn't doing something completely wrong
 then. :)
 
 I will look forward to the results of your checking.
 
 Thank you!

 Sorry for the delay.  I think my previous number (1435708800) is
 correct, and here's the function I used, for reference:
 
 (require racket/date)
 
 ;; Computes the constant for the leap seconds table of SRFI-19.
 ;; Year and month are the ones to which the leap second is added.
 ;; January = 1. Example: for the leap second added to JUNE 2015
 ;; use (leap-table 2015 6).
 (define (leap-table year month)
   (define-values (adj-year next-month)
     (if (= month 12)
       (values (add1 year) 1)
       (values year (add1 month))))
   (define dd (date 0 0 0 1 next-month adj-year 0 0 #f 0))
   (date->seconds dd #f))
 
 Cheers
 P.
