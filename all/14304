>Description:
The documentation of make-reader-graph ( http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._make-reader-graph%29%29 ) says that it can create cyclic graphs with some kind of “objects”, but it fails to name prefab structs.

Files: [plt] / pkgs / racket-pkgs / racket-doc / scribblings / reference / pairs.scrbl

Lines 1216-1218

  Since the copied values can be immutable, and since the copy is also
  immutable, @racket[make-reader-graph] can create cycles involving only
- immutable pairs, vectors, boxes, and hash tables.
+ immutable pairs, vectors, boxes, hash tables and prefab structs.



Also, the previous paragraph of the of make-reader-graph docs says that “[...], and with placeholders created by make-hash-placeholder with an immutable hash table.” It doesn’t say anything about make-hasheq-placeholder and make-hasheqv-placeholder.

This is in lines 1211 and 1212, but the “new” redaction is not obvious and the sentence becomes too long.



The same problem is in the documentation of hash-placeholder? ( http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._hash-placeholder~3f%29%29 ). It says that [hash-placeholder?] “Returns #t if v is a placeholder created by make-hash-placeholder, #f otherwise.”, but it should include the other versions. This is in lines 1285 and 1286.
