>Description:
Racket readline package does not recognize my custom key bindings as defined in ~/.inputrc. Instead, only the default ones are present.

OS version info:

$ sw_vers
ProductName:	Mac OS X
ProductVersion:	10.10.1
BuildVersion:	14B25
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Have custom key bindings in ~/.inputrc. For instance:
       "\ei": previous-history # Meta-i
   will let you use M-i to cycle back in the history
2. Verify those bindings work in the shell
3. Run 'racket -il readline'
4. Custom key bindings do not work. In my case, M-i doesn't work any more and I have to use the default one (C-p).

 There's no special code for loading it, instead, it's readline doing its
 thing.

 I tried just that, and it worked fine.  (Including the comment, even...)

 That can be infested with a whole bunch of problems -- I don't remember
 any shell that uses readline.  (Though some shells might still try to
 parse it.)  That's at least the case for bash and zsh.

 (Not that I expect anything different, but FWIW, I use it via (require xrepl).)

 Ah -- doesn't OS X expect to use some ~/Library/whatever path instead of
 ~/.inputrc?  Also, IIRC macs can (or do?) have a setup that makes some
 differences between the command-line stuff and other things.
 
 (But that's just guessing.  It works fine on linux, so some mac thing is
 probably making things different.)

 I think OS X uses editline by default to emulate readline, so that might
 be the cause of this difference.

 Thanks for the suggestions to both of you. After a bit of searching online for the differences between libedit and deadline, I discovered that libedit uses ~/.editrc and that it has different command syntax ("man 5 editrc”). To test, add:
 
 	bind "^[i" ed-prev-history # Meta-i
 
 to ~/.editrc, and M-i should cycle back in history.
