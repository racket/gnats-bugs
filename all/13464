>Description:
TR's contract for Nonnegative-Flonum doesn't allow +nan.0.

It's possible to allow +nan.0 implicitly; for example:

#lang racket

(module defs racket
  (require racket/contract)
  
  (define (nonnegative-flonum? x)
    (and (flonum? x) (not (< x 0.0))))
  
  (provide (contract-out [nan nonnegative-flonum?]))
  
  (define nan +nan.0))

(require 'defs)
nan
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(module defs typed/racket
  (provide nan)
  
  (: nan Nonnegative-Flonum)
  (define nan +nan.0))

(require 'defs)
nan

plt/collects/racket/contract/private/blame.rkt:89:0: nan2: broke its contract
 promised: Nonnegative-Float
 produced: +nan.0
