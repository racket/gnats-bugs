>Description:
http server hangs using read-line to read header lines until the line is completely read.  Green threads do not rotate.  Sighup ignored,  thread-kill ignored, custodial shutdown ignored. If running in drracket, that hangs too, ignoring all button pushes, and stops painting the window (Debian 7, recent drracket).  Possibly related to another potential bug where one http session causes the server not to service connections from other sesssions.  Can it be that other basic calls like this have the same behavior?

 So it is normal behavior for some standard library functions to hang the
 REPL?  to hang drracket?  and to cause the process to ignore signals?  This
 is surprising.
 
 Can you list other library functions that this is normal for?  That do not
 work with threads .. this is not a little thing.  I don't see anything in
 the docs about this.
 
 I looked up "primitive port"  in the documentation and nothing relevant
 shows, can you provide a pointer to this?

 No, hanging the REPL is not normal. It was a serious bug, which is why
 I repaired it right away and requested that the repai be included in
 the upcoming v6.1.1 release.
 
 By "primitive port", I just mean a kind of port whose implementation is
 built into the run-time system. The bug that you found could only
 happen with something like "/dev/zero" or a large file; other kinds of
 ports end up with stopping points for various reasons.
 
 Thanks for the report!
