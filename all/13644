>Description:
When I run `raco pkg install pfds`, it just hangs and even after waiting
several minutes, it doesn't finish installing. I set the logging level to
debug and looked at the output:

I checked /var/tmp/ and the tgz file was downloaded and even appeared to be unpacked
into another temporary folder, but it still didn't proceed past that.
