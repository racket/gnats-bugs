I edit a small file (~70 LOC). When inserting "" everything is snappy at first. I can see in the contour how the buffer is quickly turned red, then normal again after the second " is read. After some editing this unpredictably turns into multi-second pauses where DrRacket isn't usable. Mean time is roughly 10 seconds.

Unfortunately I can't be more specific, there doesn't seem to be a specific trigger. Restarting helps for a time, but this is definitly something weird that happens in the background that leads to this peak load when syntax checking.

Hopefully this is reproducable. I'm on a modern, fast macbook. Maybe inserting the two "" 'atomically', without rereading the complete file is an easy fix?

I have seen this behaviour from DrRacket since I got back to Racket about two months ago. I don't think I ever had this problem last year.

 Does the problem go away when you hide the contour window?

 Okay, thanks.
 
 It is definitely the case that the contour window contributes to bad
 responsiveness in DrRacket, so when you feel like you're noticing bad
 behavior, be sure to disable it, as it will just confound the search
 for the other problem you're seeing. (We are working on a better
 implementation of the contour window so hopefully that'll be fixed
 before too long.)
 
 Meanwhile, as to the other problem, there is some very useful
 debugging feedback you can provide when you next get DrRacket into the
 bad state.
 
 First, in preparation, go to the "File" menu and select "Install
 package" and type "drracket-test" in the dialog you see. After that
 installs you've got some extra performance debugging code installed.
 
 Then, next time you get DrRacket into the bad state, hold down the
 "alt" key and click on the number just before "MB" that you see in the
 bottom right of the DrRacket window. You should see a new window with
 some buttons in it appear. Click the button labelled "Start Following
 Log" and then do whatever normal editing commands you do that feel
 very slow. Repeat things a few times to make sure we get good data.
 Then, go back to that new window and click "Stop & Dump". You should
 get a window with a lot of stuff in it. Copy and paste that stuff into
 an email here and maybe that'll give us some clue what's going wrong.
 
 Thanks for all your help, btw!

However, it's not just the contour, the whole buffer beyond the first " is turned red slowly, then back slowly after the string literal is valid code. I noticed the cursor stops blinking and doesn't start again by itself until new input is typed, which appears delayed but then Dr. gets back to normal. Except I dread typing strings :-)
