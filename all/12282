select getting started
Then select How to Design Programs

My browser tells me that there is no such link.
This happens both in the downloaded full tree and in http://docs.racket-lang.org/

 Thanks,
 Mozilla firefox does find the link.
 Internet explorer does not find it.
 IE shows the following link with a slash too much: http:///www.htdp.org/.
 Mozilla shows the corect link: http://www.htdp.org/.
 The extra slash of IE occurs both in downloaded docs and on the
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/ site.
 No need to re-open, I think. Surely a problem of IE.
 Jos

 thanks.
