>Description:
create a module to be used as teachpack 
try to add it to the list of teachpacks
this is the error message I get

Users/matthias/Library/PLT Scheme/4.0/collects/installed-teachpacks/valrose.ss:1:0: compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: (module valrose scheme (provide printf))
>How-To-Repeat:
I placed this module into ~/Trash/valrose.ss

(module valrose mzscheme (provide printf))

I started drscheme and chose Beginning Student. 
Then try to add the above as teachpack. 
(Problem persists when you change the file to 
#lang scheme
(provide printf)
