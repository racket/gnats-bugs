>Description:
After working on a file that had been working perfectly for many hours, an error appeared saying "open-input-file: cannot open input file: "V:\C_PLT_Racket_52\collects\htdp\error.rkt" (The system cannot find the file specified.; errno=2)" without any identified reference to any file..... Closing and opening the program caused the error to disappear. Deleting the most recently added code did not help...there was no visible source to this error.

 This sounds like a failure in softgrid, which is where you get the V:
 drive from (IIRC).

 Since this is likely a bug in the Northeastern system, and not in
 Racket, I'm closing this.
