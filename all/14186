>Description:
I was able to reproduce a seg fault in my racket branch. OS X/10.8.5

Branch https://github.com/shekari/racket/tree/segfault
>How-To-Repeat:
Steps to reproduce:
Compile racket normally with typed-racket-test and typed-racket libraries.

raco make tests/typed-racket/unit-tests/typecheck-tests.rkt
This will fail with an issue about not being able to write procedures in to the compiled form.

racket tests/typed-racket/unit-tests/typecheck-tests.rkt
This will segfault.
