>Description:
The function get-module-code is documented to accept a module path as its required argument, contracted to accept either a path or a module path, and calls raise-type-error unless it gets a path or string.  I don't know which of these three specifications is the intended one, but they should be reconciled somehow.  Also, if it accepts both paths and module paths, it should be clarified how strings are interpreted.

 FWIW, paths and module-paths don't overlap, I don't think
 (path-strings overlap with module-paths), and there are several places
 where those are the arguments.
