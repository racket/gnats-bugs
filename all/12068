>Description:
Buttons for language-specific tools start off to the left of the tool buttons, but opening a new tab cause them to move to the right.

I've observed this both with the stepper in the student languages and with performance report in TR.
>How-To-Repeat:
- Start DrRacket.
- Change the #lang line to htdp/bsl
- The `step' button is the left-most tool button.
- Open a new tab.
- Go back to the first tab.
- The `step' button has now moved to the right of the `check-syntax' button.
