>Description:
When calling floor with certain floating point numbers (6793 being one specific example, though there may be others) as argument will return a non-integer value if there are any decimal digits present. The exact value of the decimal digits does not seem to affect the result, although I've only done limited testing on that.

For instance, (floor 6793.0) will return 6793.0 instead of 6793.
>How-To-Repeat:
Call floor with 6793 (appending any number of decimals) as an argument. There are other integers where this occurs, but I am unable to recall which ones it happened to me for.

 I believe this is the right answer. 6793.0 is an integer according to
 the definition of the integer? predicate. (Typed Racket type system
 uses Integer to mean something different than the integer? predicate.
 Perhaps that's the confusion? But in any case, the type of floor in
 typed racket shows that it doesn't return Integer.)

 I've just done some more testing and I can't really put my finger on what
 exactly is going wrong here. The return value is an integer as per the
 integer? predicate, however, when flooring a certain combination of
 decimals and dividing the result by 100 afterwards, I ended up getting an
 error in a call of modulo. This is probably just general floating point
 weirdness.

 Well, let us know if you run into more trouble.  You might find the
 mailing list to be a better place to post these things.
 
 I'll close this bug report. Feel free to re-open or open another one
 (or a github issue) if you find something more concrete.

 Okay, I've just done some more testing on this and while the predicate 
 integer? evaluates to true, dividing by 100 afterwards resulted in 
 errors when calling modulo on some occasions. So, this is probably just 
 general floating point weirdness that I didn't think about because I 
 shouldn't be doing work this late.

 You may want to use `exact-floor`.
