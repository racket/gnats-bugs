>Description:
When using scribble --html, two @note's that are too close to each other will be displayed on top of each other on the side of the screen, making them unreadable.

My workaround is to check that I'm not writing footnotes too close to each other. But when converting existing documents to scribble, I don't get to choose where the footnotes are and how long the text will be.

Also, you don't seem to support a @note inside a @note very well.

The desired result would be that footnotes should be made not to overlap, possibly by some javascript code, that sorts all notes and makes sure relevant ones are being displayed close to where they should, yet pushing around those that would overlap. Google Documents does something like that with side comments.

@abstract{
  I remember mentioning this bug to Eli and/or other people on #racket,
  but I see no trace of a formal bug report, so here it is.
}

Imagine you write a note@note{
  Like this note, here.
  Let's make it somewhat long so it wraps around and take some space.
}.
And another note@note{
  Like @emph{this} note, there.
  Making it long enough to make sure you get the point.
}.
Now use the scribble html backend.
Displayed on either chrome or firefox, the two notes overlap in the most ugly way.

Even worse, you don't seem to support a note inside a note:@note{
  Consider @note{this note} that note that is going to be moved to the right.
}
in the html the recursive note appears to the right of the note it annotates (if there's space)
and in the pdf it doesn't appear at all!
