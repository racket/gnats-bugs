After dismissing the dialog, the bug-submit page just sits there, until I hit the 'abort' button.  I *am* able to view the synthesized-info without a problem.

 Hi Ian: would you mind giving this a try with a release candidate, if it
 isn't too much trouble?
 
 http://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/release-snapshots/
 
 You want the "Racket plus Tests" section....

 Okay, it works fine in the release candidate; sorry for the false-positive!
  (I saw Matthias show a screenshot that said 6.0.0.1, and got all excited
 and found that download !-)
 
 You can close all three bug reports: 14275, 14276, 14277.
 (I double-checked the issue in those as well.)

 Oh, and the others may be bugs that were introduced after the release

 Reported by Ian Barland for release: 6.0.0.1<br>
 <br>
 *** Description:<br>
 When I try submitting a bug report from DrRacket&#39;s Help &gt; Submit Bug=
  Report..., a dialog pops up with:<br>
 <br>
 string-trim: contract violation<br>
 =C2=A0 expected: string?<br>
 =C2=A0 given: #&lt;eof&gt;<br>
 =C2=A0 context...:<br>
 =C2=A0 =C2=A0/Applications/Racket v6.0.0.1/collects/racket/string.rkt:76:0:=
  string-trim22<br>
 =C2=A0 =C2=A0/Applications/Racket v6.0.0.1/collects/net/http-client.rkt:174=
 :4: loop<br>
 =C2=A0 =C2=A0/Applications/Racket v6.0.0.1/collects/net/http-client.rkt:197=
 :3<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 After dismissing the dialog, the bug-submit page just sits there, until I h=
 it the &#39;abort&#39; button. =C2=A0I *am* able to view the synthesized-in=
 fo without a problem.<br>
