>Description:
The following does not work in v6.0.1.4, probably due to
recent undefined-related commits:

-> (class object% (super-new) (define-values () (values)))
; readline-input:6:27: let-values: empty body not allowed
;   in: (let-values ((() (values))))
; [,bt for context]

It works in 6.0.1.1 and earlier:

> (class object% (super-new) (define-values () (values)))
#<class:unsaved-editor451:3:2>

This affects TR (and explains why the TR tests fail on HEAD) since
its type annotation forms expand into `define-values` forms like
these. It can probably be worked around if this change to
`define-values` handling is necessary.
