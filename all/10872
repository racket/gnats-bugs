>Description:
Get rid of your preference file and start DrRacket:

 1. The "get guidance" link in the interactions
    window gives you a "Module" option that doesn't work.

 2. The "Choose Language" dialog starts with both radio
    buttons selected.

 3. The default module language is "scheme", but it should
    change to "racket"

 I had already fixed this one, actually, but I did it by changing the
 language default settings to "#lang racket". That has the effect that
 if you change languages and change back, you'll get "#lang racket" but
 if you already had "#lang scheme" in your preferences file, nothing
 chnages.
 
 I could take the more drastic step of, whenever I see "#lang scheme"
 in the preferences file, I change it to "#lang racket" (or even with
 some suffix).
 
 Do you have an opinion?

 Yes, that's all I was asking for.

 The way it works now seems fine.
