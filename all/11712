>Description:
This is the next frtime-inspired bug. The code below, when run in DrRacket, prints out a single period (or two) and then seems to be frozen. Dragging the slider around doesn't cause it to move.

When you run it in Racket, you see dots for a while, but if you grab and drag the slider back and forth then you stop seeing dots until you move the focus to some other app and then back to the racket window. The slider still actually moves back and forth during this time, tho.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define f (new frame% [label ""]))
(define sl (new (class slider%
                  (define/override (on-subwindow-event r e)
                    (printf ".") (flush-output)
                    (super on-subwindow-event r e))
                  (super-new [parent f]
                             [label ""]

 I don't know if it helps to provide a different angle of attack, but
 the slider you get by running this program also still doesn't work:

 This doesn't appear to be completely fixed. Running the file from
 racket in the commandline seems to work now, but running the program
 in drracket doesn't yet work.
 
 I'm not sure what drracket is doing to make this a different bug, tho.
 Obvious things like creating a new eventspace and using a
 text:ports<%> object for the output port aren't it.

 Looks like the drracket symptom with the slider problem also happens
 under windows, so its not some kind of strange cocoa behavior
 apparently.

 There was a scheduling bug in Racket that caused the `(flush-output)'
 in the example program to hang the GUI's eventspace thread. That's not
 fixed.
 
 The example still doesn't completely work within DrRacket: the slider
 doesn't respond to mouse events, although "." prints out for each mouse
 movement. The reason is that `(flush-output)' triggers a
 synchronization with DrRacket's thread, and so `on-subwindow-evet' gets
 stcuk, and so the event never reaches the control. I see no solution to
 that problem, but this limitation of `on-subwindow-evet' is now
 documented.

 I'm not completely following this. What is it about syncronization
 with drracket's thread that causes on-subwindow-event to get stuck?
 
 FrTime seems to use on-subwindow-char to catch mouse events in
 controls -- maybe it should be using the control-specific callback
 instead? Would that avoid this issue (assuming that this issue is
 event the problem with frtime)?
