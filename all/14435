 Is this really a wording issue? The mistake is that ..._c shows up on =
 the RHS. If ..._c can never show up on the RHS, then I would raise an =
 error that says "indexed ... cannot appear on the RHS" or something like =
 that. If they can, I am actually stumped.=20

 Yes, it is a wording issue. You are getting the generic "I saw a bad
 underscore" error which happens to apply to ellipses here.
 
 But the suggested wording is problematic, since there isn't always an
 "RHS". For example:
 
    (term (x ..._c))
 
 is also problematic, on its own.
 
 And in a define-judgment-form "rhs" should be "output position" or similar
 thing.
 
 I could just say "this ellipsis cannot have an underscore" or something
 like that?

 1. A general error message would be "An indexed ellipsis is not allowed =
 in this (kind of) term context." This would work well if you could =
 highlight the specific ellipsis that is in error.=20
 
 2. Can you grab enough of the context to make the error message more =
 specific? In that case, you could specialize the error message w/o =
 spending energy on highlighting the specific ellipsis.=20

 I think that was already happening. Are you sure you didn't see that?

 Highlighting the ellipsis is the easy part. :)

 I think you're saying you don't recall if you got the highlighting?
 That's fine! I found this to be a very clear bug report.
 
 When I run the example, I got highlighting of the ellipsis and I
 didn't see anything wrong with that part of the code. I did improve a
 few other things related to ellipses highlighting that maybe you got
 in the larger program so hopefully everything is okay now.
 
 If not, we can revisit.

 Strange. I wanted to say I did not see the ellipsis high-lighting, which is why I spent so much time on it.

 Did you get the error via online check syntax and not type cmd-period, perhaps?
