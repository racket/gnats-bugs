>Description:
The code below causes the following internal error:

internal error: ended with unbox or depth

The code is pretty convoluted, but the slight changes mentioned in the comments cause the error to disappear.

This error occurs in collects/tests/racket/benchmarks/shootout/nbody-vec.rkt

I can't reproduce it on x86.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base

(require racket/flonum)

(let loop-o ([o (list (flvector 0.0))]) ; if I use a regular vector, it works
  (when (pair? o)
    (let* ([o1  (car o)]
           [dx  (- (flvector-ref o1 0) (flvector-ref o1 0))]) ; if I remove this dead variable, or replace one of the flvector-ref, it works
      (flvector-set! o1 0 (fl+ (flvector-ref o1 0) 0.0))) ; if I replace fl+ with + or unsafe-fl+, it works
    (loop-o (cdr o)))) ; if I get rid of the loop, it works
