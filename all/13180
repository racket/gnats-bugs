>Description:
DrRacket has some problems with modal dialogs on Windows. A modal dialog is not always brought to the front when any one of the sub-modal windows is given the focus.

Open a DrRacket window. 
Pull up a search in files dialog (multi-file search).
Without dismissing the search dialog navigate to the DrRacket window (e.g. using Windows toolbar). 
Observe DrRacket window is now on top of multi-file search dialog but no mouse/keyboard events get sent to DrRacket.
Only after the multi-file search dialog is brought to the front (e.g. using Windows toolbar) and dismissed will DrRacket again receive events.

An open modal dialog should always be brought to the front and given focus if an attempt is made to activate any other DrRacket window.

In the case of the multi-file seach dialog though, I diagree that it should be modal in the first place.
