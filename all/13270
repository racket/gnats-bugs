>Description:
This is in reference to my email to users@racket-lang.org (http://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2012-November/054954.html) regarding two problems:

1) The documentation for the handin-server/checker library suggests using #lang handin-server/checker, but doing so provokes this error:

standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found
collection: "handin-server/checker/lang"

2) Any checker.rkt file that creates an evaluator causes this error:

Error in your code -- namespace-attach-module: a different module with the same name is already in the destination namespace module name: "/usr/local/racket/collects/scheme/base.rkt"

I am now reasonably certain that the two errors I referenced in that message are bugs: neither behavior occurs under Racket 5.2, but both do under 5.3 and 5.3.1.
>How-To-Repeat:
Bug #1: Write this checker file in an active assignment directory in the handin-server's working directory tree, and attempt to hand in to that assignment:
;; ---
#lang handin-server/checker
(provide checker)
(define (checker users submission) "anything.rkt")
;; ---

Bug #2: Write this checker file in an active assignment directory in the handin-server's working directory tree, and attempt to hand in to that assignment:
;; --
#lang racket
(require racket/sandbox)
(provide checker)

(define (checker users submission)
  (define e (make-evaluator '(special intermediate)))
  "anything.rkt")
;; --
