>Description:
Thanks to the wonderful distinction you guys have created between the "transformer environment" and the "runtime environment", where you deliberately and arbitrarily hide things that should be made accessible, there is no way to define macros that can be used within syntax-transformer lambdas.

You guys created the kludgey "define-for-syntax" to create functions that can be seen in the "transformer environment," (instead of just allowing functions created with "define" to be visible) but neglected to create "define-syntax-for-syntax" to make macros available there. But you were thoughtful enough to notify me in the resulting error message that the problem is related to the transformer/runtime veil. Now I have to create a separate file in which to define the macro like some Java savage.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(define-syntax foobar
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ foo) (doesnt-matter foo))))

(define-for-syntax (doesnt-work blah)
  (foobar blah)) ;; Nope! Not allowed! "Undefined identifier in 
                 ;; module" because foobar macro isn't visible!
                 ;; Will the next version require Eclipse?

 You want
 
 (begin-for-syntax
  (define-syntax ....))
 
 I see "define-for-syntax" as an old compatibility thing and ALWAYS use
 begin-for-syntax.
