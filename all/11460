>Description:
In the current release version of Racket (5.0.2), the get-gl-config and
set-gl-config methods for bitmap% in racket/draw are present and documented.

The class in git is missing both methods but they are both still
listed in the documentation for bitmap%.
>How-To-Repeat:
Output from the REPL:

. . send: no such method: set-gl-config for class: bitmap%

Same thing in 5.0.2:

 The load-file method is also missing.

 I think the resolution of this bug will be to remove the methods from
 the documentation and add to the list of incompatibilities in the
 release notes.
 
 The reason is that bitmaps created with `(new bitmap% ...)' do not
 support OpenGL drawing in v5.0.99.x. Only bitmaps created with
 `make-gl-bitmap' support OpenGL drawing, and `make-gl-bitmap' is set up
 to take the OpenGL configuration at creation time.

 Right --- there's a `load-bitmap' method that should be `load-file',
 and I'll fix that.
 
 Thanks for the report!
