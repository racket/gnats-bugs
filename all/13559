>Description:
Say you have this program and you wish to rename x to loi because it is a better name: 

#lang racket

(module a racket
  (provide
   (contract-out
    (f (->i ((x (listof integer?)))
            (result (x) (and/c (>/c (apply max x))))))))
  
  (define (f l)
    (- (apply max l) 1)))

(module b racket
  (require (submod ".." a))
  
  (displayln (f '(1 2 3))))

(require (submod "." b))

The binding structure of ->i does not bind x at the arg contract but in the dependency list for result. 
While you can rename x there, the x in the arg position remains and must be renamed manually. 

It would be great if ->i would establish the binding structure so that Dr's rename would work properly

  | change expansion of ->i to make renaming work better in check syntax
  | 
  | Specifically, when expanding in the body of a dependent argument, put
  | the original variable for the dependened on field into that code, but
  | changing the expansion so that the binder becomes the original field's
  | x, not the x in the dependent declaration list.
  | 
  | This means that, for example, in this program:
  | 
  | (->i ([x any/c]
  |       [y (x) (begin x any/c)]
  |       [z (x) (begin x any/c)]) any)
  | 
  | the first x will be the binder and the other four now count as
  | bound occurrences.
  | 
  | Also, rip off Casey's redex check syntax tests to add tests
  | 
  | closes PR 13559
