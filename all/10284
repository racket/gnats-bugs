>Description:
Section 12.9.1 of the PLT Scheme Reference explains Readtables and 12.9.2 explains the Reader-Extension Procedures used to construct new readtables.  These procedures may take 2 or 6 arguments.  Neither section clarifies the 4 optional arguments sufficiently for a programmer to make use of them.

Section 12.9.1 says this about the arguments:

"The first two arguments are always the character that triggered the reader macro and the input port for reading. When the reader macro is triggered by read-syntax (or read-syntax/recursive), the procedure is passed four additional arguments that represent a source location. When the reader macro is triggered by read (or read/recursive), the procedure is passed only two arguments if it accepts two arguments, otherwise it is passed six arguments where the last four are all #f. See Reader-Extension Procedures for information on the procedureâ€™s results."

Section 12.9.2 says:

"When a reader-extension procedure is called in syntax-reading mode (via read-syntax, etc.), it should generally return a syntax object that has no lexical context (e.g., a syntax object created using datum->syntax with #f as the first argument and with the given location information as the third argument)."

Presumably this refers to the list form of datum->syntax's third argument; however, the list must have four, not five, arguments.  Neither paragraph describes how these four optional arguments correspond to a source location's five elements.

The meaning of these arguments could be clarified by any or all of: a contract for the reader extension procedure, prose describing its arguments, or illustrative example code.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 15:37:24 -0500
Reason>>> there's now a big example


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:35:54 -0500
Reason>>> samth closed
