 Hi,
 
 Were you running the 32-bit version of Racket or the 64-bit version?
 
 If you were running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit variant of Windows,
 then installing the 64-bit variant of v6.1 may solve the problem.
 
 If you need the 32-bit version, or if the 64-bit version of v6.1 still
 crashes, you could try the latest snapshot, which is available here:
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/
 
 We have fixed a problem that particularly affects the 32-bit version of
 Racket on Windows, but we're still trying to assess whether the repair
 addresses all recently reported crashes. Any feedback that you can
 provide would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks!
 Matthew
