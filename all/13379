 I can reproduce this behavior and someone else on IRC had the same issue
 earlier today. It seems to go away when you open a new tab, so I'm
 guessing it's related to PR 13311 (odd, since I recall checking that the
 bug was gone after Robby's fix).
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Just start up drracket and then open the contour and that's all you need to
 do? Or do you start it up with the pref already set? Or something else?

 I tried both (1. start up DrRacket, open a big file, turn on contour 2.
 start up DrRacket with contour already on, open a big file) and nothing
 shows up either way unless I open a new tab.
