>Description:
It looks like generate-term is broken for metafunctions that contain no clauses at all.  I'm guessing the fix is simply to return #f when the given metafunction contains no clauses.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program:

#lang racket

(require redex)

(define-language Blub
  (a variable-not-otherwise-mentioned))

(define-metafunction
  Blub
  bogo : a -> a)

(generate-term #:source bogo 5)
