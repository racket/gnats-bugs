>Description:
Using M-g to go to a specific line in Dr Racket produces silly error messages if your cursor is in the find/replace text boxes.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open Dr Racket

2) paste in the following:
#lang racket

(display "this file has several lines in it!")

(display "it sure does!")

3) Press the keyboard shortcut for "Find" (Cmd-F on a Mac).

4) Click the mouse in the text box used to enter text to find so the cursor/focus is there

5) Press M-g to open the go to line dialog box

6) enter a number that should be a valid line number in this file, such as 3, and press 'OK'

7) see funny error message (below) and wish it had just gone to line 3 in the document instead

"3 is not a valid line number. It must be an integer between 1 and 1"
