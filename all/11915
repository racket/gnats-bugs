>Description:
The examples for the sgl library in the collects error when we try to run them.
We don't know if its an issue with openGL or the examples. The example always fail on the line 88 of gl-frame.rkt.
We have replicated this on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.10. Also any documentation for the sgl library, beyond what is presently in the docs, would be great.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open collects/sgl/examples/gl-frame.rkt. 
Click run.
In the interactions window:
> (gl-run)
send: target is not an object: #f for method: ok?

the other examples, alpha and gears, also fail due to this error.
