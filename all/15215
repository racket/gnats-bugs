>Description:
The only thing that "readline-lib.rkt" does is provide a hook for
specifying a library.  The thing is that the hook is searched in only
two places:

1. (find-user-share-dir) => which requires installing a package, a
   process that needs to be repeated after every update.  (And
   personally, there's about 0.5% that I'll remember to do that at the
   end of the semester.)

2. (find-share-dir), which AFAICT, is useless since it'll never be there
   assuming that I don't want to hack my installation tree.

It should be very easy to make it try some environment variable that
will have a name for a library to load, which I can then set in my
.racketrc or wherever, and not have to worry about it again.

(BTW, this is because my machine does not have the expected libeditline
version, so it barfs.)
