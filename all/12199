>Description:
The rendering of the triangle/ass function (part of the 2htdp/image module) is flawed. The rendered image doesn't match with the angle-a property of the triangle. If I set angle-a to be 90 degrees, the resulting picture is not a right triangle. In similar functions (triangle/sas, triangle/ssa), it renders correctly, but using triangle/ass, the image it outputs is wrong. By the way, it is also rendered wrong in your documentation.
>How-To-Repeat:
1: (require 2htdp/image)
2: (triangle/ass 90 100 100 "solid" "black")
3: The image it returns is NOT a right triangle
4: (triangle/sas 100 90 100 "solid" "black")
5: The image it returns IS a right triangle
6: (triangle/ssa 100 100 90 "solid" "black")
7: This one is also a correct right triangle
