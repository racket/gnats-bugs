>Description:
Running 'raco demod filter-rep.rkt' in 'typed-scheme/rep' works, and produces 'filter-rep_rkt_merged_zo'.  

Running that file fails: 
[samth@punge:~/sw/plt/collects/typed-scheme/rep (master) plt] r filter-rep_rkt_merged.zo 
internal error: defined name inaccessible

Running the plain file succeeds:

[samth@punge:~/sw/plt/collects/typed-scheme/rep (master) plt] r filter-rep.rkt
[samth@punge:~/sw/plt/collects/typed-scheme/rep (master) plt]

 I should probably make the cross-module-inline support less picky ---
 especially since there isn't going to be a module crossing in this
 case.
