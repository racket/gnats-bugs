>Description:
readfromfile doesnt recognize own datastructures from files when used directly in the code window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Have a file on hdd with an own data structure saved via writetofile. (i used a struct).
Now write in the program code the (main) or the readfromfile expression, so it gets executed when pressing start/run.
This way the readfromfile wont recognize the datastructure from the file.
If you call readfromfile/main from the console/interpreter then it works.

Reason>>> We need more details on what went wrong to address this issue.

What exact program did you run, and what error message did
it produce?

 Unfortunately, this isn't enough for us to figure out the problem.  Do
 you have more information about what happened, what program you ran,
 and what error message you got?
