 That's Edit -> Preferences -> Colors -> Check Syntax -> 'set!'d
 variables, right? If so, did you click "Check Syntax"?
 
 With just the online check syntax, it doesn't color variables, but you
 can see if a variable is set!'d by mousing over it and looking at the
 tooltip.

 Yes. No.

 OK. This explains my confusion. I thought the online check was
 equivalent in all respects to the manually started one.
 
 It would be nice if the online check did the colors too.  I transform
 my bug report to a wish.
 
 Thanks

 The only difference is in text colors. The online one just ignore the
 text coloring.

 :)
 
 There are two reasons why I don' tdo that: I think the flashing as the
 coloring comes and goes would be distracting (as the online check
 syntax results are more transient than seems good) and that the normal
 colorer would fight with the check syntax colorings (the latter is
 more of a technical code structuring problem, but it is one that would
 require some careful thought).
