>Description:
raco works fine when uses only one job. When I use two jobs, raco crashes with this message:

$ raco pkg install -j 2 --auto racket-test

raco pkg install: packages installed, although setup reported errors
>How-To-Repeat:
- Install a snapshot of racket minimal from utah.edu on OpenBSD amd64 with places and futures disabled.
- Run this command: raco pkg install -j 2 --auto racket-test
