 I think what you are trying to say is that the examples in section 2.2.5
 
     http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/syntax-overview.html#(part._.Conditionals_with_if__and__or__and_cond)
 
 are troublesome because they are using the substring function, which
 fails if the inputted string is shorter than substring expects.  Am I
 interpreting your comment correctly?
 
 
 
 I think it is acceptable for these particular examples to be partially
 defined because of the context.  The focus is on showing how
 conditionals work, rather than on writing total functions.
 
 In the surrounding context, the Guide has just introduced basic
 function calls, so there's minimal knowledge here. Expanding the
 examples so that they are total functions would probably clutter the
 exposition, with little aid to understanding.

 Danny: Yes, you are interpreting it correctly.
 I also was feeling a bit like you, but to be sure I came to #racket
 (IRC) to be sure: should or shouldn't situations like this one be
 reported(I don't know exactly). These examples don't bother me at all.

 ( don't interpret my phrase "even if this is "just bad documentation",
 "  too literally, please. )

 I don't think the text should be changed, so I'll close this bug
 unless there's something else to do here.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by dyoo at Sat, 23 Feb 2013 16:32:17 -0500
Reason>>> Won't change; the text is as intended.
