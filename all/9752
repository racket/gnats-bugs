>Description:
I'm using a reversed (light text on dark background) custom color scheme with DrScheme.  When I use the draw.ss teachpack and create a canvas, as soon as the canvas appears my light-colored text changes to black.  It stays that way until I save the text, at which point it reverts to the original color.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Edit the preferences to choose a white-on-black color scheme.
2) Use "intermediate student with lambda" language levels.
3) Enter this code:

; Light-colored text on a dark background:
(define (double x) (* x 2))
(start 300 300)

4) Hit the "run" button.

The text will turn black, and will remain so until the definitions window is saved.

 (Just to be clear, the white that you're seeing is the test coverage
 coloring that would look right in black-on-white mode.)
 
 Althogh I couldn't make the problem happen more than once (in a dozen
 or so tries) I found a possible race-condition in the code that
 initializes the test coverage colors, and I fixed that, so maybe it
 won't happen in the future.
 
 In the meantime, I suspect that restarting drscheme will make
 everything work fine.

Reason>>> I couldn't reproduce this, and Robby's comment suggests that
it may be fixed.  Please open a new bug if this reappears.
