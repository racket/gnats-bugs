 Can you send a screenshot? (I'm seeing a minor difference but it is one
 attributable to inexact arithmetic I believe.)

 This may be more informative: try
 (require picturing-programs)
 (define (bitmapize pic)
   (map-image (lambda (x y c) c) pic))
 (scale 4 (bitmapize (right-triangle 40 20 'outline 'blue)))
 (scale 4 (bitmapize (flip-horizontal (right-triangle 40 20 'outline 'blue))))
 
 I notice that the bitmapized original triangle has no bottom edge at all -- presumably an interaction between map-image and the "outline" phenomenon of drawing outside the bounding box, which should perhaps be thought of as a bug in map-image.  However, the bitmapized flipped triangle DOES have a bottom edge.  Huh?  Even weirder, the vertical and horizontal legs of the bitmapized flipped triangle seem to have an alpha gradient on them, so they're almost transparent at one end and opaque at the other.  Huh?

 That's the way lines that are just slightly off from horizontal/vertical are
 drawn (as these would be thanks to the imprecision introduced by
 flip-horizontal calling rotate).

 OK, that makes sense.

 Huh?  Why does flip-horizontal call rotate?
 
 Oh, I remember: you actually wrote flip-vertical, and flip-horizontal is a conjugate of it.  But calling rotate on exactly 90 degrees shouldn't introduce any imprecision.  If it does, then I think it's worth adding a special case optimized for exact multiples of 90 degrees (which are actually fairly common).

 Yeah, that's probably the best solution here. Thanks for the idea.

 In case it helps simplify the implementation, I note that dc<%> now
 supports flipping by negative scaling.

 That turns out not to help much because the library still has to actually
 compute rotations to find new bounding boxes. I could keep a notion of a
 flipped-but-not-rotated image and draw that specially but that doesn't seem
 worth the effort.
 
 Instead, special-casing rotation so that it doesn't go via radians in the
 0/90/180/270 case turned out to be really easy (and now I'm really happy
 that we used degrees and not radians!).

 That turns out not to help much because the library still has to actually c=
 ompute rotations to find new bounding boxes. I could keep a notion of a fli=
 pped-but-not-rotated image and draw that specially but that doesn&#39;t see=
 m worth the effort. <br>
 <br>Instead, special-casing rotation so that it doesn&#39;t go via radians =
 in the 0/90/180/270 case turned out to be really easy (and now I&#39;m real=
 ly happy that we used degrees and not radians!).<br><br>Robby<br><br>On Wed=

 &gt;&gt; &gt; Oh, I remember: you actually wrote flip-vertical, and flip-ho=
