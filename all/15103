>Description:
Once people get the cmd box with an error from DrR, they see that
it's kept around after quitting.  This can lead to a ctrl-c habit
to dismiss it next time you see it -- not realizing that this will
kill DrR.  In general this is probably not too bad, but in the case
of DrR (and on Windows only, of course) I think that it would be
good to spit out some text at the top explaining that this is a
console window that shows an internal error and that you'll close
it when you quit, or you can try ctrl-c to kill it if it's
unresponsive.  Or somethingâ„¢.
