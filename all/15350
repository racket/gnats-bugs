 I think you need to contact your local course staff, not us.

 We have more diagnosis and the bug looks like ours. 
 
 These two Chinese kids are happy button clickers. 
 Every time they see a button they click. The PLT file
 installer — which we are forced to use over the package 
 server because racket/raco has a bug in this Windows 
 env — comes with Abort button. So they click. Once 
 the abort button is clicked, you can no longer 
 install the .plt file on that Windows machine. 
 The error we see is the one below, which I now 
 conjecture is related to the one that prevents us
 from using the package server. 
 
 If I find out more, I let you know. 
 
 The distribution channel we use is AppV, and 
 it uses some mysterious non-existent V drive 
 that apps can’t write to. 
 
 
 [[ So far they have messed up 3 machines. ]]
