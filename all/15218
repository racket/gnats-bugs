>Description:
When I select "Choose Language" from the menu, the dialog pops up, as expected. But if I select the "Legacy Languages", the dialog gets bigger, past the bottom of the screen. I can't access the "Show Details" button any longer at that point -- there doesn't appear to be a key accelerator, and tabbing to that button doesn't seem to work.

I've tried using my Window Manager's "Move" command (Linux Mint w/ Cinnamon). With that, I can only move the dialog flush with the top of the screen, the bottom still extends beyond the bottom of the screen.
