>Description:
When a racket program is longer than one screen, a user
can scroll down. When you do, The #lang line at the 
top is shown at the top of the screen in what I'm going
to call the "language bar". When a syntax error is 
detected by check-syntax, a red highlight along the RHS
of the screen is shown. If you scroll in such a way
that the line with the error is "on top of" the language
bar, the red highlight is still shown, making it look
like the error is in the #lang line.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a fresh buffer. Underneath #lang racket, type
()
2. See a red mark on the RHS of this line, indicating
a syntax error.
3. Now, keep hitting return until the () scrolls up by one
line. The offending '()' is hidden by the #lang line, but
the error highlight is still shown, making it look like
the #lang line has a syntax error.
