When I downloaded the version of racket that is compatible with my computer system and opened the software, a black command screen popped up. I closed the program and reopeoned it and restarted the computer, however, the program still refused to open. Is the program simply incompatible with Windows 8.1 or is there some other issue that i am unaware of? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

 I think the issue here is that you probably want to start up “DrRacket”, the interactive development environment. Racket is the “engine” that drives racket programs, but it doesn’t come equipped with a user interface. This is a lot like compilers for other languages, such as C or Java.

 Can you describe exactly what steps you took in detail? It is difficult
 to diagnose the issue from the description you have given so far.
 
 In particular, did you run the "racket.exe" executable or "DrRacket.exe"
 or something else?
 
 Which version of Racket did you install?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
