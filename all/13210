>Description:
In Chapter 11 (Decorating With Style!) the css is added to the source with:
"'(html (head (title "Testing"))
 (link ((rel "stylesheet")
 (href "/test-static.css")
 (type "text/css"))) ... )

Most of the Web-browsers accept that, but its no valid html, because the link-tag must be a child of the head-tag.

In Chapter 16 (Using Formlets), when explaining the formlet-syntax, the snipped 
(formlet-dispay new-post-formlet) should be
(formlet-display new-post-formlet).
