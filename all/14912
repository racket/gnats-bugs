>Description:
[I don't remember whether the big batch of windows symlink-related
commits were after or before 6.1.1, so I'm reporting it in case this is
still relevant.]

I have a symlink that looks like:

    C:\eli\pl\collects\utils -> ..\utils

and when I do this in Racket:

    (directory-exists? "C:/eli/pl/collects/utils")

the process crashes, with the Windows obscure "application has stopped
working" message, and an event saying:

    Faulting application name: racket.exe, version: 6.1.1.0, time stamp: 0x5457cad1
    Faulting module name: libracket3m_9xtjc8.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5457cad1
    Exception code: 0xc0000005
    Fault offset: 0x0007a44f
    Faulting process id: 0xa730
    Faulting application start time: 0x01d0255600eb7987
    Faulting application path: C:\eli\plt\win32\racket.exe
    Faulting module path: C:\eli\plt\win32\lib\libracket3m_9xtjc8.dll
    Report Id: 3f7aa9d2-9149-11e4-8270-60571814dede
    Faulting package full name: 
    Faulting package-relative application ID:

Using `directory-list' works fine though.


This is running on a Windows 8 machine, 32-bit Racket on a 64-bit OS.
It's whatever MS calls the version that is not "professional" -- I think
it's the "home" edition, but not sure.  This might be relevant since on
this setup I cannot create symlinks unless the process that does them is
running with administrator rights.  I create the symlinks on a cygwin
window or in Emacs, but I start it with a "Run as administrator", and
then I do things as usual -- specifically, Racket is usually running
normally, but actually the error happens when running racket in a cmd
running as administrator too.  (If in cygwin, I use a setting that makes
it create windows symlinks, so the special cygwin symlink files are not
the issue.)

 The most recent symlink fixes were included in v6.1.1, and I don't
 think the known problems included a crash, so this must be a
 new/remaining bug.
 
 Is the symlink a "soft link" or a "junction"? (The "dir" command will
 report when a link is a junction, if I remember correctly.)

 It's a symlink.
 
 (IIRC, junction points have some weird semantics that make it
 questionable to treat them as symlinks -- something about not being able
 to point to anything outside of the same disk...  In any case, I don't
 use them.)

  | Windows: fix problems with junctions and symlinks
  | 
  | Racket wasn't reparsing correctly; the strategy worked ok
  | for links created by `mklink`, but not with other tools that
  | leave the "printed name" field blank.
  | 
  | A consequence of various fixes is that reparse points like
  | "My Documents" (in a typical configuration) correctly resolve
  | to actual paths like "Documents".
  | 
  | Finally, `directory-exists?` didn't handle root directories like
  | "C:/" correctly. The query would actually report properties of
  | the OS-level current working directory, and when junctions are
  | involved, the current directory can be a link instead of a directory.
  | 
  | Relevant to PR 14950 and PR 14912

 Does the latest fix the problem? (A snapshot is available at http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/ .)
 
 Thanks!
