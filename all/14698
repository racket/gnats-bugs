 Hi,
 
 We recently fixed a problem in the 32-bit version of v6.1 that sounds
 related to your report. A current development snapshot is available
 here:
 
    http://pre.racket-lang.org/
 
 If you have a chance to check whether the snapshot fixes the problem
 you're seeing, we'd very much appreciate it.
 
 Thanks!
 Matthew
