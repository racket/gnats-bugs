>Description:
When a module requires another module using a relative path, both the Macro Stepper and Performance Report fail with an error.

I'm reporting these together because they seem too related to not be caused by the same thing.
>How-To-Repeat:
File "provider.rkt":

#lang racket


File "requirer.rkt":

#lang racket

(require "provider.rkt")


Click the Macro Stepper button. Error:

default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/home/neil/plt/bin/provider.rkt" (No such file or directory; errno=2)


The files are not saved in "/home/neil/plt/bin", but in "/home/neil/Desktop/junk".

In "requirer.rkt", change the line "#lang racket" to "#lang typed/racket" and click Performance Report. Error:

Type Checker: Internal Typed Racket Error : #(struct:exn:fail file-or-directory-modify-seconds: `read' access denied for /home/neil/plt/bin/provider.rkt #<continuation-mark-set>) in: here in: here

 on modules that require using relative paths

 Module path resolution depends on the setting of current-directory.
 Online Check Syntax had a bug like this because it was moving some
 work that the documentation infrastructure did to a different thread
 and thus losing the current-directory setting (since it is a
 parameter) which caused modules to get resolved incorrectly, just like
 the below.
 
 So, if there are multiple threads below (or an eventspace and a thread
 or something), that could be the issue here.
