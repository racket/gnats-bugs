>Description:
The example for `protect-out` in the docs does not appear to evaluate correctly in recent versions.

For example, the 5.0.2 docs shows an error on the last line of the example:
  compile: access from an uncertified context to protected
  variable from module: 'nest in: num-chicks

which is what I'd expect. In my recent build, the last line evaluates to 3.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v5.3.0.2.
-> (module nest racket
       (provide num-eggs (protect-out num-chicks))
       (define num-eggs 2)
       (define num-chicks 3))
-> (define weak-inspector (make-inspector (current-code-inspector)))
-> (define (weak-eval x)
       (parameterize ([current-code-inspector weak-inspector])
         (eval x)))
-> (require 'nest)
-> (list num-eggs num-chicks)
'(2 3)
-> (weak-eval 'num-eggs)
2
-> (weak-eval 'num-chicks)
3
