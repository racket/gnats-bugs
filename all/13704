>Description:
I was working earlier and opened some files through the open recent menu item. I then quit DrRacket and am now back to work some more, but hovering over or clicking the open recent item does nothing.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have no idea. This happens maybe 10-20 percent of the time I open DrRacket, but I usually work on my home computer from the source that I update periodically, so I've never thought to submit it. If there is anything I can do to gather more information when it happens, I'd be glad to.
