I download the package, but cannot install Racket because I do not have administrator privileges on my machine.  Can I install it just for my own use in my directory?

How do I do this?  Is there a switch/parameter I can feed to the installer?

 The installer is built with NSIS. I don't find information about a
 NSIS-supported flag that will install without admin permissions, so
 probably there isn't one. (If you discover a flag that works with NSIS
 installers, though, it should work for the Racket installer.)
 
 
 Meanwhile, the "More Variants" download page at
 
  https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/6.6/
 
 includes a Minimal Racket distribution as a ".tgz" file:
 
 https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/6.6/installers/racket-minimal-6.6-x86_64-win32.tgz
 
 You can unpack that anywhere, and in the unpacked directory run
 
    raco pkg install -i main-distribution
 
 to get a full installation in the directory
