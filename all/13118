>Description:
When racket/unit is used as a module's language, it uses the bindings from scheme/base (not racket/base). But scheme/base and racket/base have diverged slightly; for example, scheme/base does not provide the 'hasheq' function.

The documentation for racket/unit (as language) in "6.10 Single-Unit Modules" does not actually say what the initial bindings are, but I expect that for racket/unit they should be racket/base plus racket/unit.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following program raises the error "hasheq: unbound identifier in module in: hasheq".

#lang racket/unit
(import)
(export)
(displayln (hasheq 'a 1 'b 2))
