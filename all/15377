I thought this might be a Racket/Sierra problem, but I went back to Racket 6.6, and record-sound works fine in Sierra.  Hence, the finger points to Racket 6.7.

 Hmm… I just downloaded a fresh 6.7, used the package manager to add rsound, and then ran your program, and saw no error.
 
 What is your default input device?

 Well, you’re right; you should check what version of portaudio you have. Perhaps the easiest thing to do is to open the Package Manager, click on the ‘currently installed’ tab, and start typing ‘portaudio.’ It looks like 3703edd is the latest version.
 
 If your version of portaudio is up-to-date, try running this program:
 
 
 #lang racket
 
 (require portaudio)
 
 (display-device-table)
 
 For me, this produces this output:
 
 device index 0: api = paCoreAudio, device name = "Built-in Microph", 2 input channels, 0 output channels
 device index 1: api = paCoreAudio, device name = "Built-in Output", 0 input channels, 2 output channels

 Sorry, should have written:
 
 #lang racket
 
 (require portaudio)
 (pa-initialize)
 (display-device-table)
