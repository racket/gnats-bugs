 The newly documented behavior seems to not follow the actual behavior.

 I'm pretty sure this is a bug (probably one of those usual "I'm using #f to
 indicate nothing's here but accidentally it went somewhere where it got
 treated as a contract" type things).
 
 Stevie, can you confirm that this is a bug? (I'll fix it.)

 Thanks. Looks like I may have introduced it, too. Sorry about that.
 
 While I was there, I noticed that this program produces 2, when it should
 really produce 1 (there is some code duplication going on).
 
 (let ([x 0])
   (class/c (init-field [x (begin (set! x (+ x 1)) any/c)]))
   x)
 
 That requires less localized changes to fix, so I think I'll just fix it on
 my branch that has some other class/c-related changes pending unless anyone
 could use this fix.
