>Description:
I have students complaining that they cannot
step their solutions to homework assignments.  
The issue boils down to any use of big-bang 
in a program prevents the stepper from working, 
giving the following awful error message:

annotate/inner: this region of code is still under construction

This is the case in 5.0.1 and moderately recent
builds from git (8/25/2010).
>How-To-Repeat:
Step this program in BSL (notice big-bang is 
never evaluated, but it doesn't matter):

(require 2htdp/universe)
(define (go _)
  (big-bang 0))
