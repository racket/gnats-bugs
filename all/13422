 We need more information for this bug report.
 
 
 What book are you referring to?
 
 
 Do you mean: How to Design Programs, 1st edition:
 
     http://htdp.org/
 
 or: Picturing Programs:
 
     http://picturingprograms.com/
 
 
 or some other book?  There are enough books that it is unclear which
 what you are talking about.

 Ok, thank you for the disambiguation.
 
 
 So you are looking at the Hangul equivalent of:
 
     http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-8.html#node_thm_5.1.5
 
 However, given that it is correct in the English edition, this is
 specifically a Korean translation issue of the book.  I believe this
 is out of our jurisdiction.
 
 
 You may want to report this to the authors directly; their email address is:
 
     authors@htdp.org
 
 and they should be able to forward the correction to whoever is
 responsible for the translation.
 
 
 Otherwise, I think we can close this bug report.  Thanks again!

Reason>>> Confirmed that the report is on the Korean translation of 
HTDP, on the problem described in http://htdp.org/2003-09-
26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-8.html#node_thm_5.1.5  It's correct 
in the English edition.  I sent a recommendation to the OP 
to send a bug report to HTDP authors.

 Unfortunately, I'm at pre-school level in terms of my Korean.
 
 미안!  (Sorry!)
