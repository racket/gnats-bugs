 Can you say more about what the problems are? I've got a pretty big
 monitor (not sure if it is 30") and haven't noticed anything, but
 maybe I'm just not doing something you're doing?

 Best if I just let Eli come play with my setup.
 
 But here is how I manifest it on my linux system:
 - fire up Dr Scheme and rack up the font size to 24; go full screen.
 - shut it down and restart it, say on a .ss file.
 - observe lossage.
 
 I had this problem a year ago, and I believe Eli had it narrowed down then.

 I found the previous bug report:
 
   http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=8978
 
 (I don't think that I had much more information than that, it just
 seemed like a low-level mred drawing bug.)

 Thanks.
 
 I'm not seeing that on mac os x, further confirming Eli's conjecture.
 
 Probably Matthew should take over for now, but the next obvious things
 to ask: does your system have xft and cairo? (you can see that from
 the configure log when you built) and can you send a screenshot of the
 lossage?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
