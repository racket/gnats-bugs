>Description:
This message is displayed when closing the window opened by the futures visualizer:

    Are you sure you want to quit?

To the left is a big racket logo, so at first sight one believes that one is about to quit DrRacket.

A better message: "Do you want to close the futures visualizer window?"

 Probably best if this message didn't appear at all.
 
 James: this has to do with the frame% class that you're using. I think
 you can just avoid using the group-based frame mixin (I'm forgetting
 the name now). But you probably also want to revisit all of the frame
 mixins that you're using and see if you need them. (They can be used
 independently, mostly.)
