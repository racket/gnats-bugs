>Release:        5.9.3
>Environment:
windows-7-64
>Description:
The print/display procedure before read/read-line cannot be executed until read/read-line procedure be executed.
>How-To-Repeat:
my codes:
#lang racket

(module+ main
  (begin
    (display "--> ")
    (let ([in (read-line)])
      (display in))))

it works in Window cmd and DrRacket, but when I run it from Cygwin, it will be:
# racket test.rkt
(typed) foo
# --> foo

instead of
# --> (typed) foo
# foo
>Fix:
