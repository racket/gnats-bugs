>Description:
When procedure-arity-includes? is given a number instead of a procedure, the Racket process sometimes segfaults, when it should only throw a contract violation.

I've only seen this happen when procedure-arity-includes? is called inside a procedure given to map, filter, or fold. Just running

> (procedure-arity-includes? 2 0)

at the top-level or repl throws the contract violation, as expected. But any of these

> (map (lambda (_) (procedure-arity-includes? 2 0)) '(blah))
> (filter (lambda (_) (procedure-arity-includes? 2 0)) '(blah))
> (fold (lambda (_ __) (procedure-arity-includes? 2 0)) '(blah))

segfaults instead.
>How-To-Repeat:
run this:

#lang racket
(map (lambda (_)
       (procedure-arity-includes? 2 0))
     (list 'blah))

get this error:

SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0x5
