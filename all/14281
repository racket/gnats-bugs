Iâ€™m trying to build the current (HEAD) version of Racket with Visual Studio Express 2008 (a.k.a. version 9.0). 

I get this error:

Probably the problem is that I have the â€œincludeâ€ environment variable misconfigured. 
After running:
set include="c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include" 
I get the following error:

But there is no â€œwinsock2.hâ€ file in V.E. Express. (There is a â€œwinsock2.hâ€ file in V.E. â€œNoExpressâ€.)

 How did you configure your environment for MSVC? For example, did you
 run "vcvarsall.bat"?
 
 It's been a while since I last used the Express variant of Visual
 Studio, so I don't remember if there are issues with "winsock2.h"
 specifically. It's possible that you'll have to install a newer SDK, as
 suggested in

 Yes, I run "vcvarsall.bat" (each time I forget to run it, I get even
 more errors :)).
 
 The SDK suggested in SO solved my problem. After installing it, I have to
 
 1) Add the SDK’s Include directory to the include environment variable
 2) Run the vcvarsall.bat (this *adds* more directories to the include variable)
 3) Run build.bat in worksp to build racket.exe
 4) Run racket -l- setup to build raco (this step was not obvious)
 
 5?) I run raco -d ../pkgs to add the packages to the collections (I’m
 sure this is the correct thing to do.)
 6?) I’m runig raco setup, but it get’s a lot of errors.
 
 I’ll try to read a little more and try to understand the correct steps
 “5”, and “6”.
 
 I also get an error runing make, but the path variable is a mess and
 I’m runing the make from the gfortran compiler. I think I will try to
 run all of this from a clear virtual machine, and obtain a clear error
 report.
 
 Thanks

 It sounds like you make be using `make` instead of
 
  nmake win32-in-place
 
 (i.e., with an "n" on the front). Does `nmake` not work?
 
 
 You're right that step 4 is not obvious, and step 5 is a good guess but
 not right. For step 5, it should be
 
  racket\racket racket/src/link-all.rkt ++dir pkgs ++dir native-pkgs
 
 The step 6 will work. But all of those steps are performed by `nmake
 win32-in-place`, unless `nmake` is unavailable in VS Express or doesn't
 work for some other reason.

 Thanks. It (almost) worked! Screenshot of DrRacket 6:
 http://imgur.com/QpVhaIt :)
 
 I tried “make” and “nmake”. I tried many combinations. Perhaps I tried
 to use “nmake win32-in-place”, but I’m not sure.
 
 The problem was that “nmake win32-in-place” still raised an error,
 because plt\racket\src\worksp\build.bat tries to create mzcom.exe, but
 the express version can’t do it. So I added
     if defined VCEXP goto NoMzCom
 and
     :NoMzCom
 in lines 37 and 52 respectively.
 
 The next problem was that I didn’t have the native-pkgs, but the error
 is very clear and foolproof (something like: run 'git submodule init'
 and 'git submodule update').
 
 I sill get an error while rendering the documentation
 
 > raco setup: 0 rendering: <pkgs>/unstable-doc/scribblings/unstable.scrbl
 > NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'racket\racket.EXE' : return code '0xc0000005'

 > NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'racket\racket.EXE' : return code '0xc0000005
 > Stop
 
 I runed it 3 or 4 times, it last a few hours, but it stops with an
 error, each time in a different file. I suspect it's not a problem
 with the installer.

 Just another question. Is it posible to run the nmake without
 compiling the documentation? I tried with
 
 set PLT_SETUP_OPTIONS = -D
 
 but it sitll builds the documentation.
 
 I want to recompile everithing faster, and the documentation takes a
 lot of time, and I don't need it now. (I still get an error in some of
 the .scrbl files.)
