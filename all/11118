>Description:
I would expect the following to fail: 

(define-struct bx (a b))
(define Doll (signature (mixed Number (bx-of Symbol Doll))))
(define bx1 (make-bx 'a 10))

;; so far so good 

(: bx3 Doll)
(define bx3 (make-bx bx1 bx1))

;; these last two lines should somehow trigger a failure
;; bx3 does NOT satisfy the definition of Doll

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sperber" by sperber at Mon, 23 Aug 2010 04:12:35 -0400
Reason>>> I did it.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sperber at Mon, 23 Aug 2010 04:12:35 -0400
Reason>>> This is due to lazy contract checking: Signatures for 
struct 
fields are only checked when a selector is called.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by sperber at Mon, 01 Nov 2010 10:49:51 -0400
Reason>>> That's been fixed for a while, by the combination of eager 
signature checking and propagation of mixed signatures into 
parametric struct signatures.
