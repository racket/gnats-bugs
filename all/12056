>Description:
When I create a pen and pass it a color made with make-color, the call runs fine, but when I try to print an image made with the pen out, I get the error "pen-list% in find-or-create-pen: bad argument combination: (make-color 128 128 255 255) 5 'solid 'round 'round"

After some research, it appears that the find-or-create-pen method of pen-list% in racket/draw/private/pen.rkt expects either a color name as a string or a color%, but is recieving the color struct that I created with make-color and passed to make-pen.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require 2htdp/image)

(define l
  (line 10 10
        (make-pen (make-color 128 128 255)
                  5
                  "solid"
                  "round"

 I believe this has been fixed in the nightly build (and upcoming
 release); if you have the interest to give it a spin, do let us know
 if you find any other problems.
