>Description:
Running this program at the command line fails with the following error:
+: expects type <number> as 1st argument, given: '(2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4...; other arguments were: 2.4
Running from DrRacket works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(let loop ((line 0))
  ;; anything less than 20004 and no error
  (let* ((numlist (build-list 20004 (lambda (x) 2.4)))
         (n (length numlist))) ; can't use 20004 directly
    ;; also fails with quotient, fxquotient and unsafe-fxquotient
    (let* ((mid (/ n 2))
           (n1 (car numlist))
           (n2 (car (list-tail numlist mid))))
