>Description:
Ctrl-+ can be used to get the font to a size bigger than ~71,
and once that's done, opening the preference dialog throws an
error.  To get this, start a fresh DrR, use ctrl-+ until the
font is huge-ish, then (try to) open the preference dialog.

Alternatively, start a fresh DrR (with a smaller than 71 size),
open the preference dialog and dismiss it.  Now using ctrl-+
enough times will throw an error, and the font won't grow.

 Do you have the stack trace of the error?
 
 Thanks,
