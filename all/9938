>Description:
get-font% from mred's control<%> does not appear to work properly for the majority of the control<%> implementations; the following error shows up:


    procedure get-font method in basic-control%: expects 1 argument, given 0


I tried to fix this by doing the following patch:

dyoo@mithril:~/local/plt$ git diff
diff --git a/collects/mred/private/mritem.ss b/collects/mred/private/mritem.ss
index 226d144..9da3534 100644

       (private-field
        [wx #f])
       (sequence


After this, the error message is better, but things are still broken:

    send: no such method: get-font for class: .../private/wxwindow.ss:129:4

I'm not sure how to fix this properly.


Possibly related: message% is the only documented control<%> that seems to supports get-font.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang scheme/gui
(send (new button% [label ""] [parent (new frame% [label ""])]) 
      get-font)
