 You don't need to configure a browser -- the "Help Desk" menu entry
 (in the Help menu) pops up an internal browser.  You get the same when
 you hit F1.
 
 
 > The 'browser' set up dialog is quite 'opaque'.
 
 Why is it opaque -- it has items for common browsers, with the command
 line for other browsers you might have.  (I see that FireFox is not
 there, which is probably a probelm since it's very popular now.)
 
 > Why does indiana.edu keep poping in there?
 
 Where does it pop up?  The only thing I can see is the EoPL book site,
 which is hosted at indiana.edu.

 Just to make things clear -- that's not the documentation that you're
 having problems with.  When you want to see external websites you get
 a choice of using the internal browser or your own browser.  (The
 internal browser is used for browsing the documentation, but it's too
 limited for generic web content.)

 It looks like a bug -- the system did not manage to find any browser
 executable (because it doesn't know about firefox) so it tried
 "running" the URL.

 (The process failed -- no network problems.)

 Right above that input box it says what it expects.

 Yes, you need to put a space after "firefox", as the explanation text
 says.  I think that it should put a space in such obvious situations
 too.  I'll see if I can fix that.

 Right, this is the command line format.

 Because for some browsers you often need to have a command line with
 the URL and no spaces.

 I think that it would be better to have a string with a character that
 will get substituted by the URL.  Something like --
 
 * If the string has `*', then it will be substituted by the URL
 
   "foo -open(*)"
     -> "foo -open(http://blah.com)"
 
 * Otherwise the URL will be concatenated after a space and quoted.
 
   "foo"
     -> "foo \"http://blah.com\""

 The same command line is also used with netscape.  I don't have access
 to a machine with that installed, but I wouldn't be surprised if it
 wasn't as forgiving.
