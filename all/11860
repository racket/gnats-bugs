 This program exhibits the same behavior (and is what TR is doing under
 the hood):
 
 #lang racket
 (define x 1)
 (quote-syntax x)
 
 So I think this is a problem with Check Syntax, but it might be
 intentional on Robby's part.

 Sam,
 
 (quote-syntax x) may or may not be intended as a reference to x.
 However, (: x Integer) is definitely used as a reference to x by Typed
 Racket, via free-identifier=? or some similar mechanism.  Typed Racket
 needs to inform Check Syntax that that is how it uses the name, even
 though it is not expanded into a reference.

 Ok, if the plan isn't for that to be treated as reference, I'll add
 the property.
 
 Also, didn't there use to be arrows (added by Ryan) for references
 inside `quote-syntax'?

 (Also it should not be hard to fix; just put a disappeared-use syntax
 property in there.)
