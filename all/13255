>Description:
it appears that the db library does not
handle "CHAR" datatypes associated with 
MySQL tables. Specifically, a query on a 
table with a field whose type is 'CHAR(9)'
produces the error message about an unknown
typeid 'string'. And indeed, the docs don't
list 'string' as a known typeid. However,
they also suggest in the text that CHAR
will be treated as 'var-string'; it looks 
like this might be an easy bugfix. I'd be
happy to provide more detailed steps-to-
reproduce if necessary.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a database with a table like this:

CREATE TABLE instructors (id VARCHAR(128), name VARCHAR(128), soc CHAR(9), PRIMARY KEY (id));

Use this racket program to access the 
elements of the table:

#lang racket

(require db)

(define conn
  (mysql-connect #:user "clements"
                 #:database "fad"
                 #:password "aoeuidht"))

(query conn "select * from instructors")

(disconnect conn)

... see error about typeid 'string'
