>Description:
In section 7 "Lexical Scope" of the Quick introduction there is this typo:

"For example, in the following rgb-series function the uses of mk in each lambda form to refer to the argument..."

There is an extra word "to" in there. It should be

"For example, in the following rgb-series function the uses of mk in each lambda form refer to the argument..."

Thanks for an awesome environment and a great intro tutorial.
