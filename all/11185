>Description:
Two bugs:

1) ->i has an error in parsing dependent rest contracts:

> (->i ([x real?])
       #:rest [rest (x) (listof (>/c x))]
       [_ real?])
syntax-e: expects argument of type <syntax>; given '(#<syntax:4:21 x>)

2) ->i replaces '_' with 'id' in contract error messages:

> (define/contract (g x)
      (->i ([x real?]) [_ (x) (>/c x)])
    (add1 x))
> (g 'apple)
unsaved-editor506:8.20: 'anonymous-module broke the contract 
  (->i ((x real?)) (id (x) ...))
 on g; expected <real?>, given: 'apple
