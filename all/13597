>Description:
The following program produces an internal error in the MacroSteper, in WinXP. (I tested it in Win7 and it works fine?!) (I have the macro hiding disabled.)

;-------------
#lang racket/base
(require setup/getinfo)
(get-info/full (current-directory))
;-------------

The error is printed to a (black) console window and to a DrRacket internal error window.

I think that the problem comes from a lifted expression in get-info/full, but I'm not sure.

1) Get an WinXP box (I tested thin in Win7, but no error appears.)

2) Put this program in DrRacket

#lang racket/base
(require setup/getinfo)

3) Press the MacroSteper

 The Win7/WinXP distinction was false. I had the machines with a
 slightly different configuration.
 
 The real problem was the "One term at a time" option in the Macro Stepper.
 
 New reliabiliable steps to reproduce this:
 
 1) Go to the Macro Stepper
 2) Disable the "Macro Hiding" (at the bottom)
 3) Enable the "One term at a time" option (in the "Extra Options" menu)
 4) Return to the main DrRacket screen and type this code (same code as before)
 ;------
 #lang racket/base
 (require setup/getinfo)
 (get-info/full (current-directory))
 ;------
 5) Run the Macro Stepper with this program
 6) Error!

 This is a simpler program with the same problem:
 ;------
 #lang racket
 (define-syntax (lifted stx)
   (syntax-case stx ()
     [(lifted val)
      (syntax-local-lift-expression #'val)]))
 (lifted 5)
 ;------
 (The macro is a light version of begin-lifted.)
 
 The bug is in the file [plt] / collects / macro-debugger / view /
 term-record.rkt , in the function  reduce:one-by-one , because it
 doesn't handle remarkstep's. I think that it can be solved adding
 three lines, between lines 193 and 194:
 
     ;; reduce:one-by-one : (list-of step) -> (list-of step)
     (define/private (reduce:one-by-one rs)
       (let loop ([rs rs])
         (match rs
           [(cons (struct step (type s1 s2)) rs)
            (list* (make prestep type s1)
                   (make poststep type s2)
                   (loop rs))]
           [(cons (struct misstep (type s1 exn)) rs)
            (list* (make misstep type s1 exn)
                   (loop rs))]
 +          [(cons (struct remarkstep (type s1 contents)) rs)
 +           (list* (make remarkstep type s1 contents)
 +                  (loop rs))]
           ['()
            null])))
 
 In the automated test collections, in [plt] / collects / tests /
 macro-debugger / tests / regression.rkt , there is a test case that
 almost should have caught this bug: "lift in module" (line 45). But it
 doesn't have the expand-one-by-one option enabled.
