>Description:
If the render function provided to big-bang in its to-draw clause returns an image that is too big, it returns the error message

min-client-width in canvas<%>: expected argument of type <exact integer in [0, 10000]>; given 200039

which isn't very helpful to the beginner, because it doesn't even mention big-bang, much less the rendering function.  The "given" number is also confusing, because it is larger than the actual image width by a small but non-constant (not even monotonic) amount.  The above message responded to a rendering of width 200000.  A rendered width of 10000 yields an error message 

min-client-width in canvas<%>: expected argument of type <exact integer in [0, 10000]>; given 10011

Similarly, an image of width 9990 gets the complaint "given 10001", 9989 gets "given 10002", 9988 gets "given 10001", and finally 9987 succeeds.  (Well, for some definition of "succeeds"; the computer then totally hangs for several minutes while the system sets up a rendering of a 100-million-pixel blank window.)

Ideally, the error message would be something like

big-bang: requires demographic-render to return an image with maximum dimensions of (9987, 9987); given an image of dimensions (20000, 19000)

with the name of the user's to-draw function substituted appropriately, but the message should at least be

big-bang: requires a to-draw function to return images with maximum dimensions of (9987, 9987); image too large.


This error appears to apply to all recent versions of DrRacket; tested in 5.0.2 on Windows and 5.0.2, 5.1, 5.1.1 on Mac.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following in a definitions pane:

(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define (foo-render img)
    img)

(define (foo-main img)
  (big-bang img
            [to-draw foo-render]))
(foo-main (rectangle 10000 10000 "outline" "black"))



and click Run.
