>Description:
Hi,

i tried to register a finalizer for a malloced cpointer (see code). The version with will-register works without problems and i always get the appropriate message. The version with will-register instead never prints anything.

Checking the register-finalizer implementation in ffi/unsafe.rkt, i noticed that the killer thread thunk is never executed. If i replace the thread-cells parameter 'no-cell' with #f it suddenly works. 

Tested with 5.3.0.24 on 32bit Linux.

 Use `log-error' instead of `printf'.
 
 The `printf' function isn't generally safe from a finalizer context.
 And, as you've noticed, the finalizer-running thread is configured in a
 way that essentially defeats printing.
