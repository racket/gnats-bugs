>Description:
In section 9.4 racket reference for call-with-continuation-prompt it gives:
(call-with-continuation-prompt proc       	 	 	 	 
[prompt-tag	 	 	 	 handler]	 	 	 	 
arg ...)

shouldn't that be:
(call-with-continuation-prompt
proc
[prompt-tag
handler
arg ...])

I.e. as far as I can see in my testing if you have args without a prompt-tag and handler it blows up on a contract violation.

 The first one is correct actually. If you included the "arg ..." in the
 optional arguments, it would have to have a default value. The issue is
 that with positional arguments, it's just not possible to provide the
 args without the tag and handler.
 
 Ideally, this would use keyword arguments instead, but that's not
 possible because it is a primitive.

Class changed from "doc-bug" to "not-a-bug" by asumu at Thu, 13 Sep 2012 17:10:52 -0400
Reason>>> The contract is correct as is, though it is confusing due to 
the lack of keywords.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Thu, 13 Sep 2012 17:10:52 -0400
Reason>>> Not a bug.


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "asumu" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:10:12 -0500
Reason>>> asumu closed
