>Description:
In DrRacket, it is really nice that comments started with a semi-colon (e.g. '; (for-each ...)' ) are shown differently from other code.

It would be nice to also show a difference between the s-expr associated with the sequence '#;' and other code.

 Maybe DrRacket could automatically lighten (darken in white-on-black
 mode) all the colors?
