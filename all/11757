>Description:
The documentation says: "You can force DrRacket to evaluate the expression by typing Alt-Return or Command-Return (depending on your platform)."
Unfortunately, it doesn't under 5.1 with Windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type (+ 2 3) in the interaction window, place cursor somewhere in the middle of the expression and try to force evaluation. Neither ctrl-return nor alt-return does.

 Judging from this code, it looks like the key-code is the symbol
 return instead of the character return in some situations, and that's
 what's causing drracket not to like it.
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 100] [height 100]))
 (define t (new (class text%
                  (define/override (on-local-char k)
                    (printf "key ~s control ~s alt ~s\n"
                            (send k get-key-code)
                            (send k get-control-down)
                            (send k get-alt-down)))
                  (super-new))))
 (define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
 (send ec focus)
 (send f show #t)

 One idea for a workaround: you might try hitting the numberpad enter
 key. I can't seem to make my VM type that key but it might not be
 affected by the bug
 
 If it is, we'd like to know! Indeed, if you were to run the program I
 sent a moment ago and type the number-pad key (assuming that it
 doesn't actually work) then the output is probably useful for fixing
 the bug.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I've changed get-alt-down to get-meta-down to get the results for the alt-key under windows.
 The result is below, but there are no differences between return and return(numpad).
 
 strg+return / strg+return(numpad)
 key return control #t alt #f
 key release control #t alt #f
 key release control #f alt #f
 
 alt+return / alt+return(numpad)
 key menu control #f alt #t
 key #\return control #f alt #t
 key release control #f alt #f
