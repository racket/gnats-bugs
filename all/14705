 I conjecture that this issue is now fixed (no thanks to me�) in a pre-release nightly build. Can you try one of the pre-release builds, for instance at 
 
 http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/
 
 � and see whether the problem persists?
 
 Many thanks,
 
 John
 
 p.s. if I don�t hear from you in two weeks, I�ll assume that the bug is fixed. Thanks!
