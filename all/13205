>Description:
The first time you try to submit a bug report from DrRacket without a network 
connection will result in an internal error (a contract violation for 
channel-put):

tcp-connect: connection failed
  detail: host not found
  address: bugs.racket-lang.org
  port number: 80
  step: 1
  system error: nodename nor servname provided, or not known; errno=8
  context...:
   /Users/dvanhorn/Documents/git/racket/collects/net/url.rkt:198:0: getpost-pure-port
   /Users/dvanhorn/Documents/git/racket/collects/help/bug-report.rkt:208:9
channel-put: contract violation
  expected: channel?
  given: #f
  context...:
   /Users/dvanhorn/Documents/git/racket/collects/racket/private/misc.rkt:168:2: channel-put

After this, further bug submissions will not result in the internal error
for this instance of DrRacket.
>How-To-Repeat:
Disable network connection.

Create new bug report.

Submit.
