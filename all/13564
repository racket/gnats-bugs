>Description:
A strange situation where I have a couple of tabs open in DrRacket, oneof which is untitled and unsaved. When I close both tabs, one by one, and say that I don't want to save the unsaved tab, then when I reopen a file, the untitled/unsaved file appears in a tab! 
>How-To-Repeat:
Run DrRacket. (Make sure tabs are enabled)
In the blank, untitled, unsaved editor buffer/tab that appears type some stuff.
Double-click on a .rkt file somewhere in the Finder.
(DrRacket opens up that file in a second tab.)
Now, close the tabs in the reverse order. When prompted, do not save the untitled tab.
Now double-click on that .rkt file again to open it. 
(The DrRacket window opens up with two tabs again - the first one being the unsaved stuff that was abandoned/not saved.)

  | don't try to re-use the active frame when it isn't shown
  | 
  | This is a bit suspicious, since it isn't clear why a frame
  | whose show method has been called with #f should be considered
  | an active frame. Since changing that is a much more dangerous
  | change then, for now: closes PR 13564
