>Description:
The following program gives the error:

-struct/dc: expected an identifier that names a field
  at: heap-v
  in: (-struct/dc heap-node (heap-v number?))

>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module a racket
 (provide heap heap-v heap-node)
 
 (struct heap (v))
 (struct heap-node heap ()))

(module b racket
 (require 'a)
 (require racket/contract)
 (struct/c heap-node number?))

(require 'b)
