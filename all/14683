>Description:
I *think* that the "buhgz*89" captcha has been there for a very long
time now.  In the past it would be rendered at random on every web page
re-build.  I suspect that the rendering of the captcha materials (the
image, the text, and the bit in the script that checks for it) is
misplaced -- possibly like the old header.

And when it is generated it would be good to set up a nightly build
for the web pages to push changes out frequently and refresh it too.
(Since it's unrelated to the prebuilds now.)  But probably not too
important since a once-every-few months is probably enough to keep the
captcha effective.
