>Description:
1. Open two tabs in DrR, both with "#lang typed/racket".
2. In the first, add (map rest '((1))) as a second line.
3. Run both.
4. In the interactions window of the second, enter the same
   expression on the REPL.

Now compare the two type errors: the one with the expression
in the file has "Types" with output type specified and an
"Expected result".  The REPL one has just "Domains" (no output
types) and no "Expected result".
