F1 key does not work on my drracket, searching menu does not bounce up anymore. I am pretty sure my keyboard works good since the f1 key is working in another programs. Maybe I pressed some key and changed setting unconsciously. I searched 'f1 does not work Dr.racket' on google, but there were no solutions. Please help me, thank you!

 I am not seeing this problem in my windows machine. Can you supply a
 little more information, please? In particular, are you using the US
 keyboard, or some other one? Did this change recently, or was version
 6.1 always like this for you?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
