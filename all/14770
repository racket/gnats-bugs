>Description:
Because of limited screen area I need to swap between K-meleon browser to read how to program book and between DrRacket, but I experience crash after I click DrRacket.

I'm not experiencing crash when moving DrRacket window.

Necessarily is not related to specific browser. I had to compress contents of my hard drive, but that should not affect as active / inactive works in RAM, afaik. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Open how to program web page in K-meleon, open DrRacket, click K-meleon browser active, click DrRacket window active (either from task bar or clicking the window itself).

 We think that this bug is fixed for the next release. Could you try a
 snapshot build from one of the sites at
 
  http://pre.racket-lang.org/
 
 to check on your machine?
 
 (I see that the most recent Utah build failed on 32-bit Windows due to
 flakiness in the VM setup, but you could follow the "last success" link
 or use the Northwestern snapshot.)
 
 Thanks!
