 The problem appears to be a new path randomization security feature
 of Sierra.
 
 If you drag just the "DrRacket.app" file out of the "Racket v6.6"
 folder, then drag it back in, DrRacket should work. (Yes, really.)
 
 Note that if you have put "Racket v6.6" in your "Applications" folder,
 you'll have to hold down Command while dragging the application to make
 it move instead of create an alias.

 We've now updated the ".dmg" for the distribution so that it's signed
 (in addition to signing the executables in the distribution), and that
 should fix the problem for installation on Sierra.
