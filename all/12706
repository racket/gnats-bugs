>Description:
The wrongly typed program in "Steps to Reproduce" type checks because TR thinks the `else' branch is unreachable.

Apparently, this error also causes the optimizer to erroneously prune the `else' branch.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(: foo (Nonnegative-Float -> Nonnegative-Float))
(define (foo x)
  (cond [(> x 0.0)  1.0]
        [else  (ann x asdfjkl)]))  ; any type name passes, valid or not
