>Description:
Several items from the "General" preferences window are missing in the actual DrRacket program, but are documented in the manual:

Map delete to backspace
Wrap words in editor buffers
Use separate dialog for searching
Reuse existing frames when opening new files
Enable keybindings in menus
Color syntax interactively

Making the matter worse, the ability to turn off "Enable keybindings in menus" is required in order to get EMACS-like key bindings in DrRacket. If this option existed in a previous version, please put it back!

The program provides the following undocumented option:

Automatically switch to the module language when opening a module.

Download the precompiled version of Racket 5.0.2, on Windows.

 Sorry -- those options have moved to Editing|General in the
 preferences dialog. (I'll be sure to update the docs.)
