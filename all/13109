>Description:
In Windows) When a file is dragged and dropped on the titlebar of DrRacket a black console window appears with an error message and the program hangs

(No error appears if the file is dropped on the main "definitions" windows.)

Error:
"DragQueryPoint: call failed (0)
context:
[...]\mred\private\wx\win32\windoew.rkt:439:handle-drop-files in windows%
[...]"
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open DrRacket
2) Drag any file and drop it in the titlebar
3) Error message appears.
