>Description:
In the Racket Guide at :
7.6 "Abstract Contracts using #:exists and #:∃"
(http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/contracts-exists.html)

In the last code example:
(provide
 (contract-out
  #:∃ queue
  [empty queue]
  [enq (-> integer? queue queue)]
  [next (-> queue integer?)]
  [deq (-> queue (listof integer?))]
  [empty? (-> queue boolean?)]))

The contract for "deq" should instead be:
(-> queue queue)

So the whole thing would look like:
(provide
 (contract-out
  #:∃ queue
  [empty queue]
  [enq (-> integer? queue queue)]
  [next (-> queue integer?)]
  [deq (-> queue queue)]
  [empty? (-> queue boolean?)]))

I found this through an error that occurred when testing how this abstract contract definitions behaves.
