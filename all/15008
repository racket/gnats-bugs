When I install drracket with raco, it always shows the same error:

DrRacket works fine but the error is annoying.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build racket minimal on OpenBSD with these options: --enable-libffi --enable-gracket --enable-foreign --enable-lt=/usr/bin/libtool --disable-backtrace --disable-docs --disable-places --disable-futures --enable-extflonum --enable-jit.

Install drracket with raco.

 The problem with writing "/usr/local/bin/mzscheme" is a bug in the
 "mzscheme" package. I'll fix that.
 
 But the attempt to write to "/home/juanfra/.racket/snapshot/bin" or
 "/home/juanfra/.racket/6.1.90.900/bin" is as intended. Do those fail
 because that directory is not writable?

 ... or is it that the "mred" files exists (from a previous run of `raco
 setup`) but the file is not writable?

 Sorry --- I think I see the problem, now. The executable is created by
 copying "racket" or "gracket". If those files in /usr/local are not
 writable (which is sensible), then the copies are not writable, and so
 an attempt to update the copy fails.
