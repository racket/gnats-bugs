>Description:
It would be nice if when autoclose parentheses is on, when the cursor is between 2 parentheses (cursor), and you press delete, it deletes both parentheses.  This would help when you decide to type a parentheses and then decide you dont need the expression you were about to type so you press delete and it deletes both.
