>Description:
The new codeblock form doesn't seem to resolve references to
identifiers that are not in head postion.

Compare these two examples, which should produce similar output,
but when using codeblock the definition of x and foo are 
unresolved, the references to true, x, and add1 are unresolved,
while the application of add1 correctly links to the add1 docs.

#lang scribble/manual
@(require (for-label racket))

@codeblock|{
#lang racket
(define x (+ 1 2))
(struct foo (x y))
(if true x add1)
(add1 6)
}|

@(racketmod
  racket  
  (define x (+ 1 2))
  (struct foo (x y))
  (if true x add1)
  (add1 6))
