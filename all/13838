>Description:
In the program below, after copying ht1 to ht2, removing an element from ht1 also removes it from ht2; the two sets are clearly aliased.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(current-print pretty-print-handler)
(define symbols '(one two three))
(define strings '("one" "two" "three"))
(define ht1 (make-weak-hash (map cons symbols strings)))
(define ht2 (hash-copy ht1))
ht1
ht2
(hash-remove! ht1 'one)
ht1
ht2
