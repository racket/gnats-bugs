 Hi Jos: for issues with the website, please open an issue here:
 
   https://github.com/racket/racket-lang-org
 
 I would just open it myself, but this works for me, so I think that
 more information is needed, perhaps the OS and browser you're using,
 perhaps exactly what you clicked.

 Hi Robby,
 
 Thanks.
 I just added an issue to https://github.com/racket/racket-lang-org.
 
 Title:
 'click for more' doesn't work.
 
 Text:
 Opening http://racket-lang.org/ under Windows 7 with internet explorer
 shows a nice page, but boxes are not expanded when clicking them.
 
 Using Google Chrome does work,
 although its font is a little bit distorted (but well readable)
 
 Thanks again, Jos

 Thanks, Jos! And I'm sorry about our baroque system for getting
 feedback. We're not especially happy with it and grateful for your
 patience and willingness to move stuff around.

 Hi Robby,
 Please, don't be sorry.
 I am very gratefull having Racket at my disposal.
 It is the best system for
 
 programming
 language-building
 documentation
 etc
 
 I have ever seen.
 The support of PLT is great and rapid.
 Thanks to you and all others of PLT and all other contributors.
 Jos
