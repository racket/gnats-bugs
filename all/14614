Consider this program:

(struct mgreenberg (ron))

(mgreenberg-ron (mgreenberg 10))

(mgreenberg? 5)

(require plai/datatype)

(define-type F (x (f number?)))
F?
x-f
x?

Binding arrows and renaming the `struct` form works correctly (woo!) but no binding or renaming is available for the `define-type` form.

 The plai/datatype macro has to give Check Syntax some hints to make
 this work. The hint protocol is documented here:
