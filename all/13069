>Description:
The program below produces a pict where about 1/2 of the labels along the x axis are cut off.

That is, I see "United S" and "Unted Ki" and "Kor" instead of the full labels.

(parameterize ([plot-x-tick-label-angle 90])
    (plot
     (discrete-histogram
      (list (vector "United States" 1)
            (vector "United Kingdom" 2)
            (vector "Korea" 3)))))

Not that you can tell from the docs. :)

 The 3D plots, though they don't use the `plot-x-tick-label-angle' 
 parameter, change their label anchor points based on the view angle. It 
 seems the 2D plots should do something similar. Let's leave this open.

 You could have the default label anchor mean "pick something smart
 form one of the other choices based on the angle"? That sounds nice.
 
 (But it was also hard to find that parameter.)

 I could lie and say that's exactly what I meant, but I totally forgot 
 that parameter even existed. :D
