>Description:
Capturing delimited continuations in a loop will cause a segfault.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v5.3.0.1.
-> (require racket/control)
-> (define (loop) (shift s (loop)))
-> (define (go) (reset (loop)))
-> (go)
SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0xffffffee2ab6c300
Aborted

This works too:

$ racket
Welcome to Racket v5.3.0.1.
-> (require racket/control)
-> (define (loop) (control k (loop)))
-> (define (go) (prompt (loop)))
-> (go)
SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0xffffffc7f77e32d0
Aborted
