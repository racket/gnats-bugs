>Environment:
Debian GNU/Linux 7.1 amd64
>Description:
When bitwise-arithmetic-shift-right from R6RS is called with a (ridiculously) large shift amount it does not return the correct value.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program with plt-r6rs:
(import (rnrs))
(display (bitwise-arithmetic-shift-right 42 (+ 1 (greatest-fixnum))))
(newline)
It should print 0, but it prints 42.

  | fix `arithmetic-shift' with shifts close to `(- (expt 2 31))' on 64-bit
  | 
  | The bug was caused by an accidental cast of a 64-bit integer to a
  | 32-bit integer.
