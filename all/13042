>Description:
Hi,

Maybe you want double check the file names in the example codes
in Section 17.3.6 of The Racket Guide:

1. At the end of the section 17.3.6:

   Finally, the "literal/runtime-config.rkt" module must...

I believe it should be

   Finally, the "literal/show.rkt" module must ...

The attached patch will fix this problem.

Best regards,
lee
