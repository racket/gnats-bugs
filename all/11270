>Description:
I attempt to save the Racket file that I am working on for the first time, and specifically set the filepath to be C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket
but DrRacket saves the file to C:\Users\Josh\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Racket\filename.rkt
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a new file in DrRacket, select the save icon.
Set the filepath to C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket.
Close the file.
Now there are two ways to cause the bug to reveal itself.
1: search for the name of the file in the search bar in the start menu.  Both opening the file and attempting to open the file location propmt Windows to explain that there is a missing shortcut and that Windows is now searching for it.  Soon thereafter, a popup window will explain that

"The item 'filename.rkt' that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly.

Nearest match based on size, date, and type: 'C:\Users\Josh\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Racket\filename.rkt'

Do you want to fix this shortcut to point to this target or do you want to delete it?"

Fixing the shortcut will show that the file was actually saved in that location rather than C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket.

2.  The other way to cause windows to bring up the same error, is to attmept to open the file via the recent files option for commonly used applications on the start menu.

 Windows is doing this, not DrRacket.  That is: DrRacket says "please =
 store the file here". Windows then stores the file somewhere else.
 
 For more on this, google for "local virtualstore".  Here's a hit I got =
 that explains some of this.

 Please let me know if you don't want me to close this bug report.
 
 Thanks!
