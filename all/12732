>Description:
Run this program in drracket:

#lang racket/gui
(define frame (new frame% 
                   [label "Example"]
                   [width 800]
                   [height 600]
                   [alignment '(left top)]))
(send frame show #t)
(define test (new canvas%
                  [parent frame]
                  [paint-callback
                   (lambda (canvas dc)
                     (let* ((brush (send dc get-brush))
                            (color (send brush get-color)))
                       (send brush set-color 0 0 150)
                       (send brush set-style 'solid))
                     (send dc draw-rounded-rectangle 5 5 600 25))]))

Then close the window.  Note that there's a big blue bar in the interactions window.  Then mouse over the definitions window, and it turns blue as well.

 The program should have failed with an error about changing an
 immutable brush. I'll push a repair.
