 I took that button as a canceling operation, not an ok'ing operation.
 It is certainly easy to change, but this seems like something that one
 would find rules for in, say, mac os x's human interface guidelines.
 
 I don't suppose anyone on this list knows them to know what it says?

 I agree with Jon, that clicking the button should have an immediate
 affect. I couldn't find anything directly related to pressing the X
 button in a dialog window but I did find this text:
 
 http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conc=
 eptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGUserInput/XHIGUserInput.html#//apple_ref/doc=
 /uid/TP30000361-TP9
 
   "The effect of a click should be immediate and obvious. If the
 function of the click is to cause an action (such as clicking a button),
 the selection is made when the button is pressed, and the action takes
 place when the button is released."
 
 Which leads me to believe that changes should be propagated immediately,
 and not just when the 'ok' button is selected. (Even worse, a number of
 preferences in DrRacket force you to re-open the entire program to take
 effect. I think some of them could be changed to work immediately.)

 Yes, that already happens (well, it does for the font size dialog and
 I generally try to do that). Then, when you click the close button,
 that also immeidately has the same effect as clicking cancel, ie
 reverting your changes....

 An example to follow might be the Network control panel. It has a close
 button o the frame plus "Revert" and "Apply" buttons. If you make
 changes and then close the frame, a dialog asks whether you want to
 Revert or Apply the changes.

 Asking is probably the best thing, yeah. But revert/apply seems wrong
 since most of the pref changes apply as you click on things.

 The font size (in particular) /does/ have an immediate effect, which is,
 I think, part of why people are so confused when X-ing out the preference
 dialog box appears to undo the change.

 Both the OS X and Gnome HIGs suggest so-called "instant-apply"
 preference dialogs.  That is, changing the font in the dialog should
 change the font in the document, and then closing the dialog window is
 just closing a window - it has no effect.

 I think that this is indeed the source of the confusion -- my memory
 of most Mac (and other Apple product) interactions is that changes
 apply immediately, which has been propagated to gnome too.  The
 switch, at least as I observed it on the gnome/gtk side, is from:
 
   * Changes happen when the preferences are applied
   * "OK" applies the changes and closes the dialog
   * "Cancel" closes the dialog and ignores all changes
   * Closing the dialog is equivalent to a "Cancel" (=> does nothing)
 
 to:
 
   * Changes happen immediately,
   * "OK" just closes the dialog -- leaving the new changes in place
     (so it's similar to the old "Cancel")
   * There is a "Revert" button instead of "Cancel", which restores the
     settings at the time that the dialog was opened
   * Closing the window is equivalent to an "OK" (=> does nothing,
     leaving new prefs in place)
 
 As for DrRacket, I think that the real confusion is in the font size,
 since it applies immediately which makes people assume that it follows
 the second behavior when the window is closed.
 
 IMO, a warning is fine, but tedious to get out of.  Overall I like the
 second thing more, so I'd prefer it over the warning.  [Another option
 is to "fix" things and go with the older UI behavior, which is
 probably easy (avoid the immediate font update), but I find it useful
 to play with the font size dynamically.]

 Okay, I'm convinced. Sounds like this is what we want:
 
   escape key => revert
   click on cancel => revert
   click on okay => do nothing (just hide the window)
   click the close box => do nothing (just hide the window)
 
 Those are the only ways to make the window go away, I believe.

 I think this should be like closing the window, which is what Esc
 means for most dialogs I'm used to.

 In this case, the button should change name to "Revert".  And then it
 probably shouldn't close the window.

 At the moment, we have a "revert to defaults" button also in the
 dialog. Adding "revert" would seem to be confusing.
 
 Otherwise, I like the idea.

 How about "set defaults" or even just "defaults" for that=3F

 What about "Undo" or "Undo Changes" or "Undo Current Changes"?
 
 In general, I think the trend in HCI-inspired UI design is for longer
 phrases with fewer technical words.  So maybe "Revert to Defaults"
 could be "Go Back to Default Settings".
