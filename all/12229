>Description:
In the "Parallelism with Places" section is the sentence
"The consequence of this second feature is that place should appear immediately in a module or in a function that is called in a moduleâ€™s top level; otherwise, invoking the module will invoke the same module in a new place, and so on, triggering a cascade of place creations that will soon exhaust memory."
There are then two examples of doing just that, each labeled with "Don't do this!".  I assume the word "not" was intended before "appear".
