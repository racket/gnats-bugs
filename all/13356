>Description:
I noticed a few glitches during Racket installation on Mac OS X. I can't say it was difficult to install for me, but various details should be improved (a StackOverflow user was similarly confused http://stackoverflow.com/q/9047257/53974). After some discussion in the #racket IRC channel , here are my comments.
0) Racket should either have an installer, or better documentation, or a DMG with a slightly better layout. But all installers I've seen on Mac OS X require admin privileges, so that might be problematic (I don't develop native Mac OS X programs, so I have no expertise on these topics).

1) Usually you can move freely applications around - with DrRacket, you can't.
2) So I'm not supposed to do just anything, I should be a good boy. But how? In a DMG, I've come to expect:
*) either an icon to drag within Applications, and a link to Applications (often with an arrow from the icon toward Application what to do, but maybe that's asking too much).
*) or the icon of an installer to run.
Instead, I find a folder containing subfolders such as bin, doc and so on. To me, this clearly spells "this doesn't belong in /Applications"!
3) The README does not explain how to perform the installation, but suggests I can run "raco docs":

Racket comes with extensive documentation: use DrRacket's `Help' menu,
or run `raco docs'.

I'm able to edit my PATH, but a README would surely tell me to do that - now I'm even more convinced that I must have missed the icon to click to do the installation.
4) The website is not extremely accurate either:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html
"On Mac OS, double click on the DrRacket icon. It may be in your Applications folder, or in the .dmg that you downloaded."
But the DrRacket is supposed to be not directly in /Applications, but in a subfolder with all the rest. If you try to follow those instructions during installation.

5) In the end, after some googling on external sites, I solved the issues by:
(a) copying the Racket folder in /Applications
(b) adding the bin folder to the PATH manually
(c) hiding subfolders such as bin from the GUI with:
$ chflags hidden /Applications/Racket\ v5.3.1/[a-z]*
(following the example of /usr, /bin and so on).
(d) renaming README to README.txt to have the right icon (the extension should probably be hidden in an ideal world).
Steps (c) and (d) could be pre-done in the DMG. Hiding files is a bit controversial - as a prerequisite for that, one should add the link to /Applications in the DMG, to reduce the likelihood that users drag individual icons into /Applications.

 Thanks very much for your detailed comments and suggestions!
 
 Although I didn't try to change the "README" file suffix to ".txt" or
 add an "Applications" folder alias to the ".dmg", I made many small
 improvements along the lines that you suggest.
 
 (I'm leaving the PR open until we can see how the changes look in the
 next nightly build.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 04 Jan 2013 11:02:53 -0500
Reason>>> Nightly build looks as intended --- better, at least, though it would be nice to 
script the build process to add a decoration to the folder as well as the usual 
drag-to-"Applications" link and layout.
