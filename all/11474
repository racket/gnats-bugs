>Description:
The set-event-type method is missing from mouse-event% in the
latest git version. It is present in the latest release (5.0.2)
before gr2.
>How-To-Repeat:
At the REPL, the following is the expected output (pasted from 5.0.2):

> (require racket/gui)
> (define m-e (new mouse-event% [event-type 'enter]))
> (send m-e set-event-type 'left-up)
> (send m-e get-event-type)
'left-up

From git:

> (require racket/gui)
> (define m-e (new mouse-event% [event-type 'enter]))
> (send m-e set-event-type 'left-up)
. . send: no such method: set-event-type for class: mouse-event%
