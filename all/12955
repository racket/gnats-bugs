 The first argument to `read-syntax' is a name to use for source
 locations. The input port is a second argument.
 
 The argument order was a bad choice, and it trips me up often, too.

 I think the issue here is that `read-syntax` actually takes two optional
 arguments (tripped me up too). Try this instead:
 
   (read-syntax 'foo (open-input-string "3"))

 You're right. I should have read the docs more carefully.
 
 Sorry for the noise. I'll close the bug.
