>Description:
Hi— I've tried both 32 and 64-bit installs. If I launch DrRacket and try to run, say, the sierpienski triangle, DrR crashes, and it always crashes immediately upon every restart unless I delete the Prefs file and Save Application State from User/Library. Slideshow also crashes immediately no matter what.

All I did to install Racket was to drag the folder to Applications.

Also (unrelated), is there any advantage in installing via Homebrew? Seems like I would lose the GUI apps? Yet, how would I use emacs to work on racket and work with "live" output/grpahics, etc.… can I pipe emacs output to DrRacket? (no response necessary, don't want to bug anybody… I haven't even tried to look this up for myself yet) Thank you, cheers
>How-To-Repeat:
Running anything at all, including setting lang pref; all subsequent launches.

 That sounds like a problem that happens with Yosemite, and the
 "Environment" information in your report also suggests Yosemite.
 
 If that's right, please try the release candidate for the upcoming
 v6.1.1 release, which should fix the problem:
