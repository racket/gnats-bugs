>Description:
I got a crash + core dump on linux, with the error message below.
It turns out that I had drr running on a different screen (two
separate vnc sessions) with -singleInstance.  Quitting the other one
made the error go away.  I'm not sure where this error can come from
but one thing that is always a mess is setting up security, and in my
case it's probably broken in a way that might get in the way of one
process trying to talk to another on a different screen.  (But note
that I am able to run in one session a command with a -display and
get it to open on the other.)

======

Gdk: The program 'drracket' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 130 error_code 3 request_code 20 (core protocol) minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment
   variable to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
