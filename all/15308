 I'm not completely sure I'm following the comments, but the problem
 appears to be that the installation was not completed. Hopefully,
 running "raco setup" from the command line will eliminate the issue.

 That is a problem with the SICP pkg (one of many packages that you may
 have installed that aren't part of the main racket distribution) and I
 do not think will affect the HtDP languages.
 
 After that completed, did (+ 1 2) become somewhat more normal speed in
 DrRacket (you have to restart DrRacket after raco setup completes).

 (Of course I wouldn't leave DrRacket running while running `raco setup`)
 
 Anyway, yeah, it's still leaking memory the same way.
 
 NB: I only bothered to test it using the normal `#lang racket` this time.
 
 It's apparently nothing to do with the HtDP languages.
 
 It's apparently a much more basic problem.
 
 Have you run my test yourself?
 (Run (+ 1 1) in DrRacket over and over again
 while looking at the output of a loop that does `free -h` every second.)
 
 Can you see the memory usage keep going up? Or does it not do that for you?
 
 My boyfriend just tried it on his system, and says he gets the same result
 (it adds an average of maybe 20 megs of usage every time he runs it.)
 He's using a very similar system in terms of software
 (not hardware)
 because I originally got my gentoo from copying his,
 but yeah.
 
 Actually, he just accidentally did the test using an empty file
 rather than even just `(+ 1 1)`,
 and got the same result!

 A few things:
 
 The stackoverflow link suggests a different problem than the one that
 we now seem to be talking about.
 
 Evaluating the expression (+ 1 1) does not allocate any memory.
 
 Clicking the "Run" button in DrRacket can allocate non-trivial amounts
 of memory because it is initializing a new environment for running the
 user's program.
 
 In the past we have indeed had leaks that were manifest by repeatedly
 clicking the "Run" button.
 
 I am not seeing such a link now, at least not under Mac OS X. It is
 possible that this is platform-specific, however.
 
 To do a careful test of a leak, you need to actively involve the
 garbage collector, or else it takes a long time to quiesce. Put
 another way, the specific steps you seem to be following are not, by
 themselves, enough evidence that there is a leak (although it could be
 good evidence that the GC needs tuning, I'm not sure).
 
 I suggest you follow these steps:
 
 1) restart DrRacket
 
 2) click the "XXX.YY MB" letters in the bottom right of the screen
 until they stop changing (or change only very little). Each time you
 click, you are trigging a major garbage collection.
 
 3) click Run a number of times.
 
 4) go back to step 2, but see if the number is now larger than it was
 when you were last there.
 
 5) repeat the steps 2, 3, and 4 a few times until you're sure that
 you're seeing growth.
 
 If those steps result in what appears to be a leak, then it definitely
 is a leak.
 
 Thank you for your interest in improving DrRacket.
 
 Robby
