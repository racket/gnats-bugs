>Description:
I cannot switch keyboard input language in DrRacket started in WinXP SP3 by hotkeys ("ALT-SHIFT" or "CTRL-SHIFT").
A frame% created with editor% with text% inside demonstrates the same problem, even if started separately, without DrRacket. 
Switching by a language panel with active window of DrRacket works fine.  
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrRacket.exe
2. Try "ALT-SHIFT" or "CTRL-SHIFT" to switch keyboard language. In my case nothing happens: icon "EN" will not change to "RU" and input letters is still english. 
3. Try to switch language manually: click at language panel in right-bottom corner of screen and choose another language of input. Then try to input in DrRacket or in frame created by yours. In my case, when icon switching to "RU", russian letters successfully appears in definition or evaluation windows.
