>Release:        6.1.1
>Environment:
windows-7-64
>Description:
DRRacket 6.1.1 installs on Windows 7 Enterprise (SP1) but freezes halfway into launch.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise (SP1).
I downloaded and executed racket-6.1.1-x86_64-win32.exe. 
Next, I ran DrRacket.exe. 

A window with the title "DRRacket 6.1.1" and the DRRacket logo and a progress meter pops up. 

The progress meter fills up to about halfway and then a console window with the title "taskeng.exe" pops up with the following:  

bytes->path: path string is empty
  context...:
   loop

x-browsers->exes
   C:\Program Files\Racket\collects\racket\promise.rkt:70:15...


[Exited. Close box or Ctrl-C closes the console.]


The DRRacket window then becomes unresponsive and the only way to close it is to close the console window.

  | fix handling of empty paths in PATH on Windows
  | 
  | Check for an empty path after dropping `"`s, instead of before.
  | Otherwise, a bad PATH setting interferes with functions like
  | `find-executable-path`, which in turn can prevent DrRacket from
  | starting up.
  | 
  | Closes PR 14930
