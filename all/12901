>Description:
If I start DrRacket by clicking on a *.rkt file in Finder:
1) DrRacket opens
2) The file I clicked on is not displayed, instead I get an empty editor with a title bar containng the string "Untitled - DrRacket".
3) If  I close that window and double click on the *.rkt file again it will open that file in DrRacket.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make sure DrRacket is not already open. Attempt to open a *.rkt file in DrRacket by double clicking on its icon in a Finder window.

 I've been experiencing this problem for years, and I'm sure I've bug-reported it before (although I don't see that bug-report at the moment).  It may be related to 9310.

 Just curious:
 
 Is there a difference between clicking when DrRacket is not running already
 and when an instance is already running?

 Yes.
 
 Once Dr. Racket is up and running the same action, i.e., clicking on the icon in Finder will open the file in Dr. Racket.

 Exactly.  Even if there are no DrRacket windows open at all, if the app is already running, double-clicking a .rkt file will open it.
