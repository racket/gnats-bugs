>Description:
Apologies if this is already found/fixed (I'm looking at 5.2.1 docs):

In Doc for Timer%, in the second sentence of the Doc, replace the 3rd 'to' from:

A timer% object encapsulates an event-based alarm. To use a timer, either instantiate it with a timer-callback thunk to perform the alarm-based action, to derive a new class ...

with 'or' as in:

..., or derive a new class ...
