 The description of
      (send a-ps-setup get-paper-name) → string?
 in the Draw manual, part 21 ps-setup%
 also has this extra \n (twice !!!)

 Aha --- that helps explain how the "\n" got in the implementation,
 since I reimplemented `ps-setup%' based on the docs (though apparently
 I caught one out of two "\n"s, and didn't catch on to the source of the
 problem).
 
 Thanks!
