>Description:
Encountered by Emmanuel Schanzer during a hackathon.

If a student downloads the 32-bit Ubuntu package on a 64-bit Ubuntu installation, the install apparently runs, but the user is left with binaries that they can not execute.  Even worse, the system will report "no such file or directory", as seen in:

    http://askubuntu.com/questions/133389/no-such-file-or-directory-but-the-file-exists

Rather, the installer should check whether the system can run 32-bit executables, and stop installation with an appropriate error.

 Probably better is to make 'libc6-i386' an explicit package package
 dependency, just to ensure that things Just Work.
