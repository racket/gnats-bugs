>Description:
While writing a macro to generate test cases the check failure report showed the correct source location but the wrong file (check.rkt from rackunit). With debugging disabled in DrRacket only this is shown and is the destination of the stack-trace window.

Maybe this can be improved by using the file at the bottom of the context output as seen when run on cmdline racket.

#lang racket ; debugging disabled in lang dialog

 Hi Lorenz,
 
 
 Problem analyzed and patch written.
 
 
 The exception thrown in Rackunit doesn't currently use
 prop:exn:srcloc, which would allow it to cooperate better with
 DrRacket.  I've written a patch to correct this problem:
 
     https://github.com/dyoo/racket/commit/f5e85a650314e24852e03edde4297ad355f984ab
 
 and am currently running tests to make sure I haven't broken anything
 before pushing upstream.  This will allow Rackunit to properly
 highlight the error even in the case where the language does not have
 the debugging settings enabled.
 
 
 
 Thank you for the bug report!

 If I understand this fix correctly, I am *massively* grateful.
 
 Thanks!
