 The particular hack that the FrTime language level uses to get
 updating doesn't work without extending DrRacket's environment.
 DrRacket currently shows active things if they are pict objects but
 the FrTime signals that get returned aren't picts. It is non-trivial
 to reimplement this to make them picts, I've tried before and it's
 never been reliable.

 What are they when you use the FrTime language in the language dialog?
 (this works there)

 The object used in DrRacket is defined here:
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/collects/frtime/frp-snip.rkt
 
 The tool:
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/collects/frtime/tool/frtime-tool.rkt
 
 pulls out the 'watch' function from that with the user's namespace and
 sets them up to communicate and then changes DrRacket's render-value
 to pass them to the watcher and get the snips from the underlying
 signal objects.

 Oh, of course: it uses a snip. Sorry.
 
 I don't really see how drracket can give the right amount of trust
 here to let a snip in, without also letting bad behaving programs in.
 
 Maybe there's some way to set up snip proxies and exploit record-dc%s, tho...

 It would be nice to be able to add a new kind of argument to
 read-language that DrR knew about to all something, but I'm not sure
 what that interface would be.
 
 I find the whole frtime situation to be really disappointing because
 it is so cool, but so jarring to not be able to use the #lang
