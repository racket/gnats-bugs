 Does it make sense to change make-posn to add this check (so it only
 gets real numbers)? Or should I add the check into the 2htdp/image
 prims?

 Changing Posns is fine with me though I need a warning if you do. =
 HtDP/2e says that (make-posn "hello" true) work.=20

 I just decided to make the check more strict in the 2htdp library.
