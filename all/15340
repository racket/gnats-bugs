>Description:
On each new start drracket's toolbar is reset to show only run and stop buttons

These are also the only buttons when I choose 
file->new
 or
file ->new tab

To see the remainder of the buttons I must choose to move the toolbar to another location from the menus.  

or choose to hide then unhide the toolbar

Editing the #lang line does nothing.

My install is an in-place one, with these options

raco pkg config --set default-scope installation 
raco pkg config --set name  stable-safe-6.6

I also just now wiped the install re recompiled from source + built packages

 If you run DrRacket with GTK+ 2 via
 
   env PLT_GTK2=y drracket
 
 does it avoid the problem?
 
 If so, can you let us know which version of GTK+ 3 you have installed?
 
 Thanks!
