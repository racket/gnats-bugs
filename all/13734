>Description:
The docs for `struct/dc` mentions a #:chaperone keyword, but it
does not appear to be included either in the documented grammar
nor does it work in code:

#lang racket
(struct foo (x y) #:mutable)
(struct/dc foo 
           [x () #:chaperone integer?]
           [y () #:chaperone integer?])

Since #:impersonator isn't mentioned in the description, maybe
#:impersonator <-> #:chaperone? Or should both keywords be
supported?

 #:chaperone is what you get if you don't put a keyword. FWIW.

 I think this kind of design, where there's a default that can't be
 explicitly specified, is a mistake.  It makes it much harder to
 abstract over the form, and harder to be explicit in the code.
