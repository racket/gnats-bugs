>Description:
Hi, The raco make on my mac OS has really bad performance. It may be my laptop is not a great one, but...continue to read.

1. to compile a large project from the very start, it is really, and abnormally, time consuming. I used one pentium 4 dual core processor, 2G memory laptop installed Linux to compile a project, it only took 1 minutes and 20 seconds to finish; but on my mac os, which has i5 dual core processor, 4G memory, it took 11 minutes to finish the compiling. see the steps to reproduce
2. I also suspect that the raco make or the racket has the problem of memory leakage. The compiling process of my project will eat 2G memory on my mac(abnormal?), and after the compiling my mac becomes too slow that I have to restart the computer to continue my work.

PS: on Linux(ubuntu), everything works great
>How-To-Repeat:
you can reproduce it on all the versions(5.3.1, and the nightly 5.3.2, 32bit or 64bit)

since the compilation of the project needs plai-typed language, you need to download it and install it from: http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2012/lang/

then
1. git clone https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py.git
2. raco make python-main.rkt

Oh, OK, wait 9-11 minutes, you will get the result.(on my linux, it will take 1m20s)

Then comment something, recompile:
raco make python-main.rkt

wait 7-8 minutes to compile all the changed file(on my linux, it will take 30s)

 This sounds like timestamps on bytecode files might be out of sync, so
 that `raco make' ends up trying to rebuild the Racket libraries.
 Does running `raco setup' help?

 No, I used raco setup, and it didn't help.
 
 If it is rebuilding the racket libraries, will it rebuild them every time when I compile something?
 
 Today I cleaned all files about racket and reinstalled the 5.3.2.2, race setup it and it didn't help.(the compiling time increases to almost 30 minutes, I can't believe this...)
 
 If you need more details like run-time information generated from my computer, please just let me know.

 Hi Junsong,
 
 Unfortunately, I can't replicate the problem here; it also takes about
 a minute on my end to build your project.
 
 
 Please try:
 
     $ raco setup -v
 
 and copy-and-paste the output of that and send it to us.  It may tell
 us if any of the packages you've installed are mis-compiling and
 causing performance issues.
 
 
 
 Also, can you run the following command?
 
     $ raco make -v python-main.rkt
 
 Also copy-and-paste the complete contents of the output and send it
 over to us.  It may help us diagnose where the time is going in
 compiling, what files the compilation manager is considering, etc.
 
 
 
 
 For comparison's sake, here's a transcript of how long it takes me to
 build the python-main in the base subdirectory;
