I have installed Racket through the PPA (https://launchpad.net/~plt/+archive/ubuntu/racket) on Ubuntu 16.04. When running `raco docs` it opens `file:///usr/share/doc/racket/index.html` in a web browser, which does not exist on my system.

$ raco docs

FYI, the contents of /usr/share/doc/racket:

 Did you also install the `racket-doc` package?
 
 This is not a great error message, though. Would it be possible to have
 the `raco docs` command only be part of the `racket-doc` package?

 I only requested to install racket, not sure if racket-doc got included.
 Unfortunately I'm away on a conference and can't check until Sunday or
 Monday. I'll reinstall and send the complete transcript ASAP.
 
 Even if I'm not even close to knowing about the implementation of 'raco
 doc', it does sound like a good idea to have the command and its
 dependencies (HTML) installed as a cohesive package. That may not be
 technically feasible depending on the current implementation though.
 
 Perhaps a bit hacky, but the 'racket-doc' installer could place some marker
 file that 'raco doc' checks, if it can open a browser or if should consider
 itself uninstalled. May be tricky to do cross-platform in a clean way.
 
 Anyway, I'm just thinking out loud. :)

 I don't know about on Ubuntu, but on Debian the racket package
 recommends racket-doc; that means it's installed by default, unless
 people explicitely turn off auto-installing recommends (and then they're
 somewhat expected to know what they are doing).
 
 That doesn't mean some nicer handling of the error wouldn't be possible.
 I don't know enough about the implimentation of raco to know if
 splitting off one tool is feasible. It might be possible to manage that
 index.html page with the Debian alternatives system, so that unless
 racket-doc was installed, it displayed a stub page saying doc is not
 installed.
 
 As a further complication, let me mention that on this Debian machine,
 "raco docs" works fine (at least to the initial page), using an index
 page in ~/.racket/6.6. I suspect this is because I have installed one or
 two packages using raco pkg. Of course all the links fail since I
 uninstalled racket-doc. I don't know if that's because when the index
 page was built, I did have racket-doc installed. In any case, it
 suggests that managing one index page might not be enough, but putting
 all top level index files under the alternatives system sounds too
 fragile and labour intensive to me.
 
 TL;DR: I don't really know what to do concretely, but I'm open to ideas.

 That sounds like a good solution to me.

 Since I imagine the only way to get into this situation is to uninstall
 racket-doc (as you did), and I doubt that's a common occurrence, I'm not
 too worried.
