 It looks like you forgot
 
    (require (for-syntax racket/syntax))
 
 If you add that, does the error go away?

 Hi, Ryan.

 Ah. Yes.
 
 1. I had overlooked that with-syntax* is provided only via racket/syntax.
 
 2. Because the resulting error message wasn't something like, "Hey,
 what is this `with-syntax*' you're using?", I didn't realize that I'd
 made a mistake, and that the mistake was 1.
 
 I don't know how easy/safe it would be to provide a more-helpful error
 message. But you're right, it's definitely due to my error.
 
 Thanks,
 Greg
