>Description:
(I have no idea if this is something new or not, it's been a long time since I ran from a bare windows machine
without my usual prefs file that disables compiled directories.)

Running my course language seems to have a big time overhead on a first run, even after the installation
completed.  I discovered that it creates "drracket" compiled directories, and disabling debugging removes them.

Wasn't it supposed to avoid doing that with files from one of the collections that include ~/.racket/NNN/collects?
(Which is where my plugin gets installed since it's a simple .plt file.)

If it is supposed to do that now, is there any way to avoid it for some collection?  (Eg, I'm tempted to see what
happens if I create "drracket" files in an attempt to avoid creating the directories...)
