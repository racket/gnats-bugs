>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
I copy an image from a Web browser (I've tried this with Firefox, Safari, and IE) and paste it into DrScheme.  If into the Definitions pane, the whole pane turns black.  If into the Interactions pane, the whole pane turns black, AND I get the error message "The evaluation thread is no longer running, so no evaluation can take place until the next execution.  The program ran out of memory."

 The problem doesn't occur on Windows, as far as I've tested it, and I  
 can insert images using the "Insert" menu.

Reason>>> Just tried this with latest versions of Safari, Firefox, and DrRacket (from git), 
worked fine.  Reopen if you can repeat.
