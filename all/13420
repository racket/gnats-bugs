>Description:
Section 13.4 Interfaces
of the Racket Guide reads:
....
....
The is-a? predicate accepts either a class or interface as its first argument and an object as its second argument. 
....
....

Shouldn't that read:
The is-a? predicate accepts an object as its first argument and a class or interface as its second argument. 
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(define fish% (class object%
                (super-new) 
                (init size)                ; initialization argument
                (define current-size size) ; field
                (define/public (get-size)
                  current-size)
                
                (define/public (grow amt)
                  (set! current-size (+ amt current-size)))
                
                (define/public (eat other-fish)
                  (grow (send other-fish get-size)))))


(define minnow1 (new fish% [size 10]))
