>Description:
Please see the repro steps
>How-To-Repeat:
To repro:

1. Open a new document in DrRacket, and paste in the following code:

(define-struct/contract foo
  ((name symbol?))
  #:transparent)

(define-syntax extend-with-value
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ derived base)
     (define-struct/contract (derived base)
       ((value boolean?))
       #:transparent)]))

#;(extend-with-value foo-val foo)

(define-struct/contract (foo-val foo)
       ((value boolean?))
  #:transparent)

2. Observe that the code compiles and runs. From the Interactions window:

> (foo-val 'a true)
(foo-val 'a #t)

3.  Now make the code look like this:

#lang racket

(define-struct/contract foo
  ((name symbol?))
  #:transparent)

(define-syntax extend-with-value
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ derived base)
     (define-struct/contract (derived base)
       ((value boolean?))
       #:transparent)]))

(extend-with-value foo-val foo)

#;(define-struct/contract (foo-val foo)
       ((value boolean?))
  #:transparent)

i.e., comment out [what I believe is] the expansion of the extend-with-value macro, and uncomment the call to the macro.

4. Click the "Check Syntax" button.

5. Observe that you get the following syntax error:

with-contract: no definition found for identifier in: make-foo-val

6. Expected: for the call to the "extend-with-value" macro and [what I believe is] the "by-hand-expansion" of that same macro to have the same effect.
