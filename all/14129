>Environment:
mac-i386-osx
>Description:
the backlog documentation indicates that the %which form should be able to accept an arbitrary numb of goals, however if more then one goal is given then a syntax error occurs. The documentation could be changed to indicate that %which will only accept a single goal, however it would be more useful if %which could take multiple goals; therefore I suggest that %which be modified to accept multiple goals, instead of changing the documentation to reflect the current state of affairs.
>How-To-Repeat:
(%which () %true %true) should return '(), currently it results in "%which: bad syntax in: (%which () %true %true)"
