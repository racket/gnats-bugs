>Description:
The combinations Ctr+Insert and Shift+Insert work in the main DrRacket windows ("Definitions", "Interactions", ...) but they don't work in the textboxs in the "Search in files" dialog.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open DrRacket
2) Copy any text: for example "racket" using Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Insert
3) Open the "File\ Search in files ..."
4) Press Shift+Insert to paste the copied text
5) Nothing happens, but the copied text should have appeared.
