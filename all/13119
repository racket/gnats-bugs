>Description:
Perhaps this is a known bug, but:

Here are two PNG images:

http://world.cs.brown.edu/1/clipart/ufo.png
http://world.cs.brown.edu/1/clipart/airplane-small.png

I copy them using "Copy Image" in Chrome.  When I paste them into Windows Paint, for instance, they look just fine.  But when I paste them into DrRacket 5.3 on Windows 7 (I've tried this on both Tablet PC and aPro),

- the UFO looks like it has a pair of leading dots at the bottom left
- the plane seems to actually wrap around a little (its nose ends up on the left), and it too has the dots

If nobody can reproduce this, I can generate screen-shots.

 I've been running into things like that for years: either one pixel row and column get chopped off, or one pixel row and column get wrapped around.  It does seem to be Windows-specific -- I've never seen it on a Mac.  It may be related to bug 8283.
