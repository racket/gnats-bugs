>Description:
I tried something like this:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
    #lang racket/base
    (require xml)
    (xexpr->string
      `(html (head (title "Compiler"))
             (body
              (h1 "Write a program")
              (form 
               (textarea ((id "program")
                          (rows "80")
                          (cols "5")))))))
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


What comes out of this does not look well-formed.

"<html><head><title>Compiler</title></head><body><h1>Write a program</h1><form><textarea id=\"program\" rows=\"80\" cols=\"5\" /></form></body></html>"


textarea is not supposed to be a self-terminating tag: most web browsers will not parse it as intended.

Reason>>> HTML is not XML. Xexprs represent XML, not HTML. When you
use XML for HTML, it is not the XML that is incorrect, it is
your use of it. In this case, you can give an empty string
as the body of the tag: (textarea "") and the closing tag
will be given, or use the empty-tag-shorthand export from
XML. In fact, there is a FAQ entry on exactly this issue:

 I think this response is 100% wrong.  XML is *irrelevant* to modern
 web development, and the web server should provide tools that are
 useful to web developers, not tools that only appear to be useful, but
 in fact cause subtle bugs.  We should fix whatever is needed so that
 people stop asking this FAQ.

 I second Sam's opinion here.

 I think that it's more than that: IIRC, a textare is not one of the tags
 that is allowed to be empty.  (When I did the bindings for the
 scribble/html language I went over the DTDs, and I made it always have a
 closing tag.)
