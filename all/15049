>Description:
The circle-snip example from @secref["snip-example" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/gui/gui.scrbl")] is losing snips from saved files.

In a nutshell: copy-paste of a new circle-snip% into a file with an existing circle-snip% loses the original one after close and re-open.

It's somewhat serious because I'm experimentng with new snips for teaching [where it's also happening, hence finally noticing and checking the example from the documentation] and would like to know whether I have a conceptual error about the possible workflow(s) of a user of new snips or there's some limitation for what I'll be doing.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Saved the circle-snip example as  main.rkt  in a directory  circle-snip .
2. Installed the package as a directory via DrRacket  Install Package ...  menu item.

3. Restarted DrRacket.
4. Selected DrRacket New menu item.
5. In Interactions:
     Welcome to DrRacket, version 6.2.0.3--2015-04-30(d6b5872/a) [3m].
     Language: racket; memory limit: 4096 MB.
     > (require circle-snip)
     > (new circle-snip%)
     ; circle appeared
6. Copy-pasted circle to Definitions under the #lang racket.
7. Saved file to test-circle-snip.rkt to a directory not inside any package.
8. Closed tab.
9. Opened file again.
10. Without running, repeated steps 5-9 again (with the new circle under the old).
11. The old circle is gone, leaving a blank line, with the new circle still there.

I've tested this with a different ordering of the circles in the file, and changing the circle size to check that it's the new one that's always retained.

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/15049: snips from circle-snip example, and my
 own snips, can disappear on re-open of file
Date: Thu, 30 Apr 2015 21:53:18 -0400

 I tried adding a public method to the snip-class to make a circle-snip%,
  then getting the class via (get-the-snip-class-list) and making a snip
  that way, and that worked more [but not always] reliably. Unfortunately,
  those tests weren't tracked enough to show how to reproduce here.
 
 Making a number-snip also has the problem, immediately:
 
   > (require framework)
   > (number-snip:make-repeating-decimal-snip 123 #f)
 
 Copy-pasting the result into the Definitions, saving and re-loading, then
  loses the snip. This probably isn't telling you anything you don't already
  understand, but having the circle-snip example in the docs as-is could be
  a problem for others. Presumably it's an eventspace issue, or (if not the
  same, similar to) a 3D syntax issue, and so might be an essential limit
  for this approach.
 
 Having a keybinding insert a circle-snip% seems to work reliably, and I
  assume a tool will as well. Except for a note about this in the docs,
  I can consider it closed [or at least downgraded from serious].

Reason>>> 

I believe I have fixed this. Before two recent commits to the gui and 
drracket repo, DrRacket would just copy the snip and insert it, which 
meant that it's snipclass would not match the one that was in 
DrRacket's version of the result of get-the-snip-class-list. Now, what it 
does instead is use the read/write methods (or the snip and the snip-
class) to move the snip over. This means that DrRacket will load the 
snipclass implementation if it isn't already loaded.
