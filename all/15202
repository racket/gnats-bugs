>Description:
make-syntax-delta-introducer causes segfault when its second argument is #f, eg (make-syntax-delta-introducer #'x #f)

It likely has to do with the expander since typing the program into drracket produces the crash even without running. Opening a file with that expression immediately crashes drracket as well.
