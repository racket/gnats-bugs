Hi. I am getting the following error message on opening DrRacket:

f1-: contract violation
   expected: flonum?
   given: 0
   argument position: 2nd
   other arguments....:
     2.0

It started after I tried to change the font size from preferences and took the font size slider to the very left. I uninstalled and re-installed DrRacket. No improvement. I restarted the computer. No improvement.
