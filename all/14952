>Description:
This might be a spurious report, but this latest snapshot (6.1.1.8) I downloaded has bad behavior with the program below.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; Run in BSL: 

(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)
(define (render a-game)
  (place-image (circle 25 "solid" "red")
               50 50
               (empty-scene 200 200)))
(define (go game)
  (big-bang game
            (to-draw render)))
(go 0)

;; produces a blank window for me.
