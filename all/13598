>Description:
I used to be able to use (procedure?) to pick apart a large union type, selecting the (only) function type from it, and then calling the result. I cannot anymore: but only in specific cases involving universal quantification! In the "steps to reproduce" I've shown three variations on the problem I'm facing. In (s-ok), everything works as expected. In (s-bad1), we see the problem occur. In (s-bad2), the problem also occurs, and by using a wrapper struct I rule out the possibility of any confusion if X happened to be instantiated to a procedure type.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket/base

(struct: (X) hold ([x : X]))

(: s-ok : (All (X) X (U Symbol (X -> X)) -> X))
(define (s-ok seed thing)
  (if (procedure? thing)
      (thing seed)
      seed))

(: s-bad1 : (All (X) X (U X (X -> X)) -> X))
(define (s-bad1 seed thing)
  (if (procedure? thing)
      (thing seed)
      seed))

(: s-bad2 : (All (X) X (U (hold X) (X -> X)) -> X))
(define (s-bad2 seed thing)
  (if (procedure? thing)
      (thing seed)
      seed))
