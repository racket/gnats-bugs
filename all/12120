>Description:
I am test-driving the batch-io teacpack using some of the code in
HtDP/2e. Here is a snippet of what I am working with:

(define (main-write fst last signature-name)
   (write-file (string-append fst "-" last ".txt")
                  (letter fst last signature-name)))

(define (main-read fname) (read-file fname))

The first function and all its auxiliary functions are those in HtDP/2e.

Here's a sample run:

Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.1.3 [3m].
Language: Beginning Student [custom]; memory limit: 128 MB.
Teachpack: batch-io.ss.
(letter "sam1" "sam2" "sam3")
"Dear sam1,\nwe have discovered that all people with the last name
\nsam2 have won our lottery. So, sam1, \nhurry and pick up your
prize.\nSincerely,\nsam3"
(main-read "sam1-sam2.txt")
"Dear sam1,\r\nwe have discovered that all people with the last name
\r\nsam2 have won our lottery. So, sam1, \r\nhurry and pick up your
prize.\r\nSincerely,\r\nsam3"
(string=? (letter "sam1" "sam2" "sam3") (main-read "sam1-sam2.txt"))
false


Where did those returns (i.e., \r) come from? I would really like the
third expression to evaluate to true. That is, I would like what is
put into the file to be what is read from the file. Any quick fixes to
make life easy on my beginners?

 The `write-file' from `2htdp/batch-io' writes the file in text mode, so
 "\n"s turn into "\r\n". All other file operations from `2htdp/batch-io'
 work in binary mode, so "\r\n" isn't converted back to "\n" by
 `read-file'.
 
 I'm not sure of the history that produced the current choices, but
 maybe `write-file' or `read-file' should change to make them
 consistent.

 Marco, could you open the file 
 
   plt: collects/2htdp/batch-io.rkt 
 
 and add 
 
   #:mode 'text
 
 at line 145 so that the read-chunk function looks like this: 
 
 ;; String (-> X) ([Listof X] -> [Listof X]) -> [Listof X]
 ;; read a file as a list of X where process-accu is applied to accu when eof
 (define (read-chunks f read-chunk process-accu)
   (with-input-from-file f 
     #:mode 'text
     (lambda ()
       (let loop ([accu '()])
         (define nxt (read-chunk))
         (if (eof-object? nxt) (process-accu accu) (loop (cons nxt accu)))))))
 
 It turns out that this is Windows-only issue and I would like
 to know from you whether this fix works on your Windows box. 
 
 Thanks.

 Hi Matthias,
 
 That seems to have done it. Here's the sample:
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.1.3 [3m].
 Language: Beginning Student [custom]; memory limit: 128 MB.
 Teachpack: batch-io.ss.
 > (main-write "sam1" "sam2" "sam3")
 "sam1-sam2.txt"
 > (string=? (letter "sam1" "sam2" "sam3") (main-read "sam1-sam2.txt"))
 true
 > (string=? (letter "sam1" "sam2" "sam3") (read-file (write-file (string-append "sam1" "-" "sam2" ".txt") (letter "sam1" "sam2" "sam3"))))
 true
 >
 
 I should be able to walk my students through the small edit.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Marco
