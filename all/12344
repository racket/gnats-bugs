Reason>>> Not enough information to understand what is wrong.

(It isn't laggy for me, for example, using a slower machine
and the same OS.)

Since there is no way to contact the submitter, this seems
like a pretty useless PR.

 Unfortunately, this bug report lacks the necessary detail for us to
 determine precisely what you were doing when you encountered lag in
 DrRacket.  Just saying that an interactive program is "laggy" doesn't
 help.  What exactly lagged for you?

 Did the "notanemail@" address bounce?
