>Description:
Recently (ie, the last couple weeks) I've repeatedly gotten the following strange internal error in DrRacket. First I get a dialog with this message:

The preferences file is locked (because the file /home/samth/.racket/.LOCKracket-prefs.rktd exists), so your preference change could not be saved. Cancel preference change?

With the options "Cancel" and "Steal the lock and retry" (incidentally, this dialog isn't likely to work well for anyone who isn't an expert).

If I hit "Steal the lock and retry" I get this error:

delete-file: cannot delete file
  path: /home/samth/.racket/.LOCKracket-prefs.rktd
  system error: No such file or directory; errno=2 

I don't know what's caused this error, or how easily to reproduce it, but it happens regularly if I just leave DrRacket open.

 Just to double check: you only have one drracket open, right? (And no other
 racket software that uses the preferences system?)

 It's possible that I've started DrRacket multiple times, and/or
 started more than one but then quit some of them.

 Theoretically that could account for this problem (not that that makes it

 I'll see if I notice it when I haven't opened any extra DrRackets.

 If there's anything I can do to instrument DrRacket to help, I can do that, too.
