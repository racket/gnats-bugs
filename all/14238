>Description:
Scribble links all instances of 'file' in the example to the documentation of 'file' provided by racket/base, even though it seems that 'file' should be shadowed. Also, does it make sense to link formal parameters of defines/lambdas to docs?
>How-To-Repeat:
simple.scrbl:

#lang scribble/manual

@(require scribble/eval (for-label racket))

@(interaction
  (lambda (file) file)
  (define file #f))

@(racket (lambda (file) file))

to run:

$ scribble +m simple.scrbl
