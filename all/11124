I thought I had bug-reported this before, but I don't see it in the database.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define pic <insert-bitmap-here>)
(rotate 10 pic) ; works fine
(rotate 10 (rotate 10 pic)) ; back to original orientation

By contrast,
(define tri (triangle 30 "solid" "blue"))
(rotate 10 tri) ; works fine
(rotate 10 (rotate 10 tri)) ; works; rotated 20 degrees.

 BTW, I first noticed this weird behavior in mid-June, but thought it was =
 just that I had the direction of rotation wrong.  As of July 2, I had =
 figured out that it was a bug in the image teachpack, and identified =
 roughly the circumstances under which it happened.  I vaguely remember =
 Robby saying he had fixed it some time in early July, but it doesn't =
 seem to be fixed in 5.0.1.
