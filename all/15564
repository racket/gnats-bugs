>Description:
Using 'sleep' with 'display' seems to cause some unexpeced time delay.
It is not the case for using 'sleep' with 'displayln'.

If it is not a bug, it could be better to have more explanation in documentation.

Thanks for all hard works.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make foo.rkt:

#lang racket/base

(display 'd)
(sleep 1)     ; one second
(display 'd)
(sleep 1)     ; two seconds
(display 'd)
(sleep 1)     ; three seconds

The expected result: 'd' letter appears three times on computer screen at every second in sequence.

2. run foo.rkt on terminal: "racket foo.rkt"
 
However, three 'd' letters appear at once on computer screen after three seconds.

3. Open foo.rkt in DrRacket and run:

'd' letter appears three times on computer screen at every second in sequence as expected

 Different output port can have different buffering defaults, and that's
 what you're seeing here.
 
 To make sure you see characters that you write to a port, you can use
 `flush-output` to flush the port's buffer.
