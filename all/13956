>Description:
The `un/cache-image` function from `mrlib/image-core` is documented as accepting
anything that passes `image?`. However, this doesn't appear to be accurate:

> (require mrlib/image-core)
> (require racket/draw)
> (image? (make-bitmap 100 100))
#t
> (un/cache-image (make-bitmap 100 100) #t)
. . send: no such method
  method name: copy
  class name: bitmap%

  | make un/cache-image accept everything that image? accepts
  | 
  | I'm not sure if the precise details of how this function behaves
  | (specifically that it copies snips that aren't cacheable) is
  | important, but I suspect the implementation is more authoritative
  | that the docs in this case, so document what it really does.
