 This is a report from a student in my first-year class, who is looking
 for animated GIF support in DrRacket.

 The immediate thing that doesn't "work" is copying and pasting them
 into drracket -- that only pastes the first frame.  The student was
 also hoping to use it with 2htdp/image and 2htdp/universe to
 automatically animate, which obviously won't work.
 
 Probably, there's no bug here.

 fwiw wescheme does support animated gifs and Emu uses them to good effect.

 I'm not really clear what we should do with them. Count them as a
 vector of images? Make BSL be an frtime derivative? Something in
 between? (what?)
