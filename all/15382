>Description:
I have the following source content:

@(image #:scale 0.1 "ebube.jpg" "something")

No matter what value I use for #:scale, I do not see any difference in the output: the resulting HTML still reads

<img src="ebube.jpg" alt="something">

The reason this doesn't work appears to be because it's a JPG. The documentation is not clear on this:

https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/base.html#%28def._%28%28lib._scribble%2Fbase..rkt%29._image%29%29

It does say «The HTML renderer supports ".png", ".gif", and ".svg"» but it's not entirely clear what "supports" means, since clearly a JPG file _is_ rendered in the output — just not handled by #:scale. So I think at least the documentation could be improved to be clearer about this. [It would also be nice if the output itself said something like 

<!-- #:scale parameter ignored due to file format -->

which would have given a pretty clear hint as to what was going on, instead of silently ignoring the parameter entirely.] Changing the file from JPG to PNG does take care of the problem.
