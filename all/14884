Having recently on a whim installed some cyberpunk theme in 6.1.1.1, DrRacket 6.1.1.6 fails to load silently.  Going into the DrRacket.app/Contents/MacOS directory to run DrRacket directly clearly showed the incompatibility error.  I removed my ~/Library/Racket directory and all worked.

 Thanks for the report.
 
 I'll protect DrRacket against this specific problem, but the more
 general problem is a corollary of choices about how our snapshot
 builds are set up. If you had run "raco setup", it would also have
 fixed this problem. And we should probably re-consider some of those
 choices, although it is not yet clear exactly how.
