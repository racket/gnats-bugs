>Description:
The following program produces a contract error:

    #lang racket/base
    (require scriblib/autobib)
    (authors 0)

The error itself is expected since the `authors` form is being used
incorrectly. However, the error message is this:

    broke its contract:
      promised: content?, produced: '(0)
      in: content?
      contract from: not-enough-info-for-blame
      blaming: not-enough-info-for-blame

which looks like some internal blame info that comes from
"racket/contract/private/provide.rkt". Is this a leak of internal
data or is it the expected behavior here?

 Here's a simpler version of the problem (eliminating scribble) and
 demonstrating that it is a problem with the contract library (or
 something it relies on).

 (module m racket/base

 I've improved the error message for the code below a little (and
 adjust scriblib so you don't get to that error by adding a contract on
 authors) but I'm not yet seeing how to fix this problem properly. In
 particular, I'm not sure if I can get the negative blame information
 "in time" when substructing is going on.
 
 I'll have to think harder about that part.
