 All real numbers are also complex numbers.
 There the number 2/3 is both a real number and a complex number.
 If you want to check that a number has no real part,
 you can use (not (zero? (real-part 2/3))).

 I think

 expresses the idea a bit better than a 0-valued imaginary component. 
 [And I honestly do not know whether the two are equivalent in the 
 world of inexact numbers.]

 Matthias's version is correct, if the question one is trying to ask:
 "is this number represented as a complex number, i.e., a pair of reals".
 
 Jens's version (assuming we replace `real-part` with `imag-part`) would
 consider numbers like `1.0+0.0i` to be real, because `(zero? 0.0)` is
 true.
