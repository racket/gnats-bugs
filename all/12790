On this page:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/prompt.html

I found the following code:

(define (escape v)
    (abort-current-continuation
     (default-continuation-prompt-tag)
     (lambda () v)))

(+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (escape 0)))))))

It doesn't return 0 as expected when run inside DrRacket.

Either the documentation or DrRacket need to be adjusted.

I also found that page extremely hard to follow.  For example, in the above code, the default-continuation-prompt-tag doesn't do anything.  This was not obvious to me.  I also didn't understand why, in the second example, the default-continuation-prompt-tag inside call-with-continuation-prompt was being evaluated before the lambda.  A blow-by-blow explanation of the evaluation of the code, and why it evaluates the way it does, is needed, in my opinion.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. paste the above code in DrRacket's upper window
2. run it
3. observe that it does not return 0 as advertised in the documentation
