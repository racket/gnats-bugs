>Description:
I started using 'Jump *' from the context menu to explore code and it's really useful.

I quickly read up on some definition then want to go back but often have to start searching / scrolling.

I couldn't find a way to jump back. Does it exist? Basically I miss an equivalent to the back button well-known from browsers.

 No, there's not such a thing. If you wanted to work out how such a
 thing should work, you could use DrRacket's keybindings facility to
 experiment with it. If you find something you like, we'll consider
 putting it into DrRacket proper. (You'll probably want to use the
 mailing list for discussions about it, tho, instead of bug report
 forms.)
