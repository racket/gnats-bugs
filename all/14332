I'm getting a seg fault due to an internal error during gc when building racket from source, during the raco setup:

Seg fault (internal error during gc) at 0xb2457084
SIGSEGV SEGV_ACCERR SI_CODE 2 fault on 0xb2457084
make[1]: *** [install-3m] Aborted

I'm trying to compile this because my server (5.3.6) encountered a seg fault earlier today, so I figured an upgrade might be necessary. This is very likely a problem with the server, not racket necessarily, however I cannot tell whether it is just an edge case of the racket code. The server runs CentOS release 6.4. I have been able to reproduce the issue a number of times now. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Unpack the linux source, and configure with just --configure=/usr. I tried both that and adding --enable-sgc, but both the Senora and Boehm gc's encountered the issue.
Then, run make, and once that completes, run make install. During install, after raco setup is entered, the seg fault occurs.

 Did you have any memory use limits in place (as reported by `ulimit -a`
 in bash, for example)?
 
 If Racket runs out of memory, then ideally it would report an
 out-of-memory error, but the GC is not great at doing that (especially
 while it's trying to reclaim memory).
