Subject: Ubuntu Oneiric classic desktop; menu bar in DrRacket disappears

>Release:        5.1.1 and 5.1.3
>Environment:
Linux i686, Ubuntu Oneiric (32-bit)
>Description:
When I start the DrRacket program on my Ubuntu Oneiric 32-bit computer while using it in the "Gnome Classic (no effects)" mode, the menu bar does not appear. There is a blank area at the space where the menus should appear, and clicking on it occasionally opens a menu section, but in practice the application is unusable in this state.

While running, it prints the following warnings to the terminal window:

Gdk: IA__gdk_window_thaw_updates: assertion `impl_window->update_freeze_count > 0' failed
Gdk: IA__gdk_window_thaw_updates: assertion `impl_window->update_freeze_count > 0' failed

When using the "Unity 2D" desktop, the menu bar appears normally using Unity's convention on the top of the screen. The above warnings are still printed similarly.

This bug happens consistently with 5.1.1 that can be installed from the Ubuntu package repository, and downloadable Linux installers for Fedora and Ubuntu Jaunty for the newest version, which is 5.1.3.

Even though it is called a Gnome Classic desktop, on Ubuntu Oneiric it is GNOME 3, as opposed to version 2 on earlier Ubuntus. It is possible the problem is some incompatibility with GNOME 3.

I cannot easily compile racket on this computer, because the step for building documentation takes very long because it starts to swap for lack of physical memory.
>How-To-Repeat:
To use the Gnome Classic desktop on Ubuntu Oneiric, you need to install it:

sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback

After this you have the option to pick Gnome Classic in the login screen. After logging in, start the drracket program and it should exhibit the buggy behavior. I am using only packages from the standard repositories on my computer, and I update them regularly via automatic updates.

 This bug is fixed in the development version of Racket, soon to be
 released as version 5.2.  You can download a precompiled version of
 the pre-release here: http://pre.racket-lang.org/release/ .
