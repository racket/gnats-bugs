>Description:
In the middle of section 4 of "Continue: Web Applications in Racket," unquote-splicing is introduced, but it is not a link like other things that are in the documentation.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Go to Continue: Web Applications in Racket
2. Search for unquote-splicing
3. Try to click on it
4. Try again if you want
5. Go to the nifty "report a bug" link in the documentation page and report the problem
6. Don't do step 5, because I already did
7. Actually, maybe do step 5 with less obnoxious repro steps
