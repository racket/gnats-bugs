>Description:
Using

  (require (for-meta -1 (only-in racket cons) (only-in r5rs cons)))

I get

  module: identifier already imported for phase ffffffffffffffff from: ...

And looking into it, I see that the code uses PRIxPTR and indeed using a phase of 10
leads to "... phase a ...".  It should probably be using PRIdPTR instead.
