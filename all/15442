>Description:
After a clean install of Sierra, I can't access the online help and get an internal Racket 6.8 error. Same with 6.9 :

browser-run: process execute failed: '(#<path:/usr/bin/osascript> "-e" "open location \"file:///Users/roy/Library/Racket/6.9/doc/search/index.html?q=filter\"")

Tried plt-setup and download of new Racket 6.9.
No effect, same thing. 
osascript is here.
file:///Users/roy/Library/Racket/6.9/doc/search/ is here.
Any idea ?

Unfortunately, this appears to be a bug in macOS. Have a look here 
at what John found:
