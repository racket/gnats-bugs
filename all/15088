>Description:
I have a Beginning Student file where I have

    (require 2htdp/image)
    (triangle 40 "solid" "purple")

and then I Ctrl-click on "triangle" and click 'Search in Help Desk for "triangle". This launches my browser (Google Chrome - lastest, v43 for OSX 10.10) to file:///Applications/Racket%20v6.1.1/doc/search/index.html with nothing filled in, i.e. I have to type in "triangle". The search term should be filled in, right?
>How-To-Repeat:
A Beginning Student file with

and Ctrl-click on "triangle" and click 'Search in Help Desk for "triangle". This launches my browser (Google Chrome) to file:///Applications/Racket%20v6.1.1/doc/search/index.html with nothing filled in, i.e. I have to type in "triangle".
