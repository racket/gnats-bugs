>Description:
In the Racket guide, section 16.1.2 (http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/pattern-macros.html), in the expansion of the set! and other example, I think there's a confusion of variables.

The last bit of code in 16.1.2 has the line:
(let ([tmp_1 tmp])

but I think it should be:
(let ([tmp set!_1])

or else I'm just confused...
