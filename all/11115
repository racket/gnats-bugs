>Description:
I ran into several problems with @ syntax in Typed Racket.
Ultimately, I realized it just plain doesn't work at all.

Here's a Racket program:

----------
#lang at-exp racket

(define contents
  (lambda args args))

(define doc @contents{x y})

@contents{x y}
----------

doc is bound to (list "x" "y"), and this is also the value printed in
the REPL (for the last expr).  Now I move it to typed/racket:

----------
#lang at-exp typed/racket

(define contents
  (lambda args args))

(define doc @contents{x y})

@contents{x y}
----------

I get an error at the (define ...):

  define: bad syntax (multiple expressions after identifier) in: (define doc @contents (x y))

The expression given in the error message is telling, because if I
comment the definition, the last line errors with

  expand: unbound identifier in module in: @contents

Please make at-exp work in typed/racket!

 Typed Racket is a typed sister language to Racket. 
 You want 
 
 	@Typed Racket,
 
 which is a typed sister language to @Racket, a 
 language distinct from Racket.

 What I want is @-syntax to work, that's all. (-:
 
 You can argue this is a fault of at-syntax, which claims you can put a
 language after its name, and clearly that isn't true here.  But the
 value in having these two interoperate is clear, especially since
 their features are orthogonal.

 Since at-exps are just a different notation of sexps, shouldn't there
 be some way to make this work without involving typed-racket (at the
 possible expense of bad error messages)?

 The actual problem, I think, is that Typed Racket overwrites the
 reader rather than extending it.
