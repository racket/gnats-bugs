It would be nice to have a bitmap/file function in the 2htdp/image teachpack, since 'bitmap' is a macro, it's not helpful for loading from a file whose name is computed and stored in a variable at runtime.

 Bitmaps computed at runtime will not work well with executable
 creation, which is why I've resisted using that before.
 
 Any thoughts about that?

 Well, the same problem exists with the functions of the batch-io
 library. But it just means that the external resources (data
 files/image files) have to manually (or some other way) be put in the
 expected location in order to be found (if by "not work well" you mean
 that the external resources don't get included in the distribution
 archive) -- as long as the files are in the expected location with
 respect to the executable, they seem to get loaded fine when run.

 Yes, I mean that they will not be included in the distribution.
 
 It isn't too hard to add an extra teachpack that'll do what you want--
 is something like that feasible in your situation? I'm happy to supply
 some code, if that seems like a useful route.

 Yes, it's easy enough to define it, just more convenient if it's
 already in the library. I guess it would be possible also to load all
 images into a list or something using the 'bitmap' macro, and then
 retrieve images from that list instead of loading from file...

 Yes, putting them into a list or something would work. It is the lack
 of convenience that I'm kind of shooting for, since I can't actually
 support the operation properly.
 
 Perhaps that is wrong-headed of me. I could also just put a big
 warning in the docs. Opinions?

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/12466: Request a bitmap/file function in 2htdp/image
Date: Thu, 29 Dec 2011 18:17:18 -0500

 So, I have a simple n-body simulation lab exercise written in BSL that
 loads data regarding planets/stars from a text file in the current
 directory using the batch-io functions; part of the information in the
 text file is the name of an image file for each body - the image files
 are also in the current directory. So I needed a way to load a bitmap
 from file based on information parsed from the text file - hence
 bitmap/file. Now if a student were to make an executable distribution
 of their program, then it won't even include the text file in the
 distribution archive, to say nothing of the images, so it's obviously
 not going to work. But that doesn't mean the functions in the batch-io
 library are useless, and I think the same holds for the bitmap/file
 function. I do think that a note or warning in the docs for both
 libraries would be sufficient - warning that executables created from
 programs that use these types of functions may not be correctly
 generated because the requisite external resources won't be properly
 bundled (or, to get them to work properly, the resources need to be
 manually copied to the same directory in which the executable is
 placed).
 
 Alternatively, in full Racket, is there a way to specify names of
 external resources that should be included when creating a
 distribution archive? If so, maybe a simple interface to that facility
 could be provided in the student languages or one of the teachpacks,
 so if you really want to enable users of *SL to be able to create
 executables that load files or images, it will work properly. But
 perhaps this might be too complex of a feature to provide in the
 teachpacks.

 Okay, I'll add it.
 
 Yes, there is a way to specify that in Racket, you use define-runtime-path.
 
 I also see now that 'bitmap' only _can_ expand into
 define-runtime-path (or maybe it can't, but it should be able to in
 principle), it doesn't actually do it. :(

 Okay, I&#39;ll add it.<br>
 <br>
 Yes, there is a way to specify that in Racket, you use define-runtime-path.=
 <br>
 <br>
 I also see now that &#39;bitmap&#39; only _can_ expand into<br>
 define-runtime-path (or maybe it can&#39;t, but it should be able to in<br>
 principle), it doesn&#39;t actually do it. :(<br>

 &gt; So, I have a simple n-body simulation lab exercise written in BSL that=

 <br>
 &gt; text file is the name of an image file for each body - the image files=
 <br>
 &gt; are also in the current directory. So I needed a way to load a bitmap<=

 &gt; from file based on information parsed from the text file - hence<br>
 &gt; bitmap/file. Now if a student were to make an executable distribution<=

 &gt; library are useless, and I think the same holds for the bitmap/file<br=

 &gt;<br>
 &gt; Alternatively, in full Racket, is there a way to specify names of<br>
 &gt; external resources that should be included when creating a<br>
 &gt; distribution archive? If so, maybe a simple interface to that facility=
 <br>
 &gt; could be provided in the student languages or one of the teachpacks,<b=
 r>
 &gt; so if you really want to enable users of *SL to be able to create<br>
 &gt; executables that load files or images, it will work properly. But<br>
 &gt; perhaps this might be too complex of a feature to provide in the<br>

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *** Description:<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be nice to have a bitmap/file functio=
 n in the 2htdp/image teachpack, since &#39;bitmap&#39; is a macro, it&#39;s=
  not helpful for loading from a file whose name is computed and stored in a=
  variable at runtime. It&#39;s possible to use bitmap/url with a file:// ur=
 l, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be able to do relative paths.<br>
