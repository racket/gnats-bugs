Computer Language: (("Determine language from source") (#(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t none) (default) #() "#lang racket\n" #t #t))
>Description:
This program:

#lang racket


(case 1
  [(1) (case 2
         [(2) #f]
         [(3) #f])]
  [(2) (case 2
         [(2) #f]
         [(3) #f])])

seems to show too many tail arrows in check syntax (both on- and off-line).  In particular, mousing over the first two #f's shows one arrow (back to the enclosing case), but the second two have extra arrows back to the outer case.
