>Description:
My students and I have been successfully running DrRacket 7.0 on assorted MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac models... and all help screens have worked fine, including the ones supporting the Picturing Programs teachpack (I teach from that text).  Immediately after I upgraded my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015) to mac OS 10.14 Mohave, I could no longer use those particular screens.  The message I get in the middle of an otherwise blank Safari tab says: 
Safari Can't Open the Page. The error is: "The operation couldn't be completed. Operation not permitted" (NSPOSIXErrorDomain:1)

I still have earlier versions of DrRacket on that same iMac, and have tested that v6.10 will properly display the help screens for Picturing Programs.  I have also deleted and re-installed DrRacket v7.0... with no effect.

I want to inform our school's students about software incompatibilities (we're a 100% Mac laptop required private school). Can you please verify this as a 'bug' and/or send info for a fix, or possibly predict a timeline before a fix is available?

 I can confirm that Safari behaves in various uncooperative ways with
 Racket documentation on Mojave. Apple seems to have tightened some
 constraints on which local files can be opened in a browser.
 
 We'll look into how to get Safari to more consistently allow access to
 Racket's local documentation. Meanwhile, unfortunately, the only
 workaround I can offer is to use a different browser by default, such
 as Firefox.

 Well, here's another workaround in Safari:
 
   * Select "Edit" -> "Preferences", then choose the "Advanced" tab.
     Check "Show Develop menu in the menu bar".
 
   * Select "Develop" -> "Disable Local File Restrictions".
