>Description:
The docs claim that a child (from pict) has 7 fields, and indeed the
constructor takes 7 arguments.

However, the accessors for the last two fields are not actually
exported:

  #lang racket
  (require pict)
  child-sxy
  child-syx

(this program errors)

 It seems the reason is that the texpict-common^ signature only lists the
 first 5 fields instead of all of them. Is this intentional? Does anyone
 mind if I just add the missing fields?
