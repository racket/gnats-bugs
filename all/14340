 The problem is that a depth-1 attribute needs a value that is a list of 
 syntax (disregarding promises), not a syntax object. For example:
 
 (define-syntax-class class
     #:attributes ([v 1])
     (pattern (x:id y:id)
       #:attr [v 1] (delay (list #'x #'y))))
 
 > (syntax-parse #'(foo bar)
 >    [:class
 >      #'(v ...)])
 
 But the current error message is truly unhelpful. How about the 
 following instead:
 
 v: attribute is bound to non-syntax value
    attribute value: #<promise!#<syntax::129 (foo bar)>>
    attribute depth: 1
    sub-value: #<syntax::129 (foo bar)>
    expected: list of depth 1
    in: v
