>Description:
A requirement to have a checksum file means that I cannot serve some
random zip file as a package.  It would be nice if it used the timestamp
of the file as a fallback, which would make it work in such a case.
(And it would also simplify serving packages.)

Alternatively, something in the archive could be used as an indicator,
like some checksum of the index + dates of a zip file.

 A checksum is not required because of the force.
 
 I would happily accept a patch that used the time stamp of the file / http
 request if the normal checksum were missing.
