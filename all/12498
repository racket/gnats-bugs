>Description:
The Stepper intermittently has an internal error upon startup. It doesn't seem to affect the stepper's operation, but the error dialog would look scary to a beginner and has to be dismissed.

The error is apparently caused by `update-status-bar' being entered twice by two different threads. This causes the status text% to be in a bad state when one thread tries to change it.

There is an unusued semaphore near that function that either had been used to fix this error or was meant to but never used. Fixing the error looks as simple as wrapping the function body in `call-with-semaphore'.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start the Stepper. On my machine, about 1/10 to 1/20 of the time I get this internal error:

>: expects type <real number> as 1st argument, given: 'BAD; other arguments were: 55.0

 I had been using the semaphore, but decided on what I think is a better =
 approach; making sure that all of the gui things happen via callbacks on =
 the stepper's eventspace.  I coded this up by wrapping the initial =
 status bar update in a queue-callback, but I failed to ensure that it =
 wound up on the eventspace of the stepper frame.  I think I've now fixed =
 this, though I haven't yet tested the fix.

 Please let me know when you've tested. (This seems like the right
 strategy to me.)
 
 Thanks,

 I just started the Stepper 60 times without an error. If my initial 5% 
 probability estimate was right (it's probably conservative), and if the 
 error still has the same probability, 60 clean startups has a 4.6% 
 probability. I'm comfy calling it fixed.
