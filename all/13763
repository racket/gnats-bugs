>Description:
(I thought I had submitted this before but I'm not seeing in my searches. Apologies if this is a duplicate.)

Programs where an implicit begin ends with a definition do not have source location information. (This seemingly small thing gets frustrating quickly in today's DrRacket...)
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's the third example broken program with this error I've written this morning (pulled out of check syntax -- the result of class is about 1,200 lines long (yes, not great I know))

#lang racket

(class object%
  (define/private (find-name-to-offer binding-identifiers)
    (define name-to-offer 
      (symbol->string
       (car 
        (sort (map syntax-e binding-identifiers)
              >
              #:key (Î» (x) (string-length (symbol->string x))))))))
  (super-new))
>Fix:
