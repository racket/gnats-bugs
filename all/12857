>Description:
The documentation for the name form for worlds leads one to expect worlds can give their names as either strings or symbols, and they will be treated more or less the same. When a player connects to the server with a symbol name, they are reported on the server window as e.g. iworld6811. Also, iworld-name of a world that has joined with a symbol for a name is not the symbol given.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (innert u w) (make-bundle u '() '()))
(universe #f (on-new innert) (on-join innert))

(define (blank w) (empty-scene 200 200))
(launch-many-worlds (big-big (to-draw blank) (name 'symbol) (register LOCALHOST))

Look at dialog for universe to see that iworld394391 signed up rather than symbol.

 This is the syntactically correct program that exposes the problem in 5.3.0.11--2012-06-16(2c0cf011/d) [3m]. 
 
 I'll do more about this later. Thanks. 
 
 #lang racket
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 (require 2htdp/image)
 
 (define (innert u w) (displayln (iworld-name w)) (make-bundle u '() '()))
 
 (define (blank w) (empty-scene 200 200))
 
 (launch-many-worlds (big-bang '() (to-draw blank) (name 'symbol) (register LOCALHOST))
                     (universe #f (on-new innert) (on-msg (lambda (u w m) u))))
