>Description:
The docs for find-relative-path state that both args can be
(or/c path-string? path-for-some-system?)

That works with #:more-than-root? #f
(find-relative-path "/home" "/whatever" #:more-than-root? #f)

but fails with 
(find-relative-path "/home" "/whatever" #:more-than-root? #t)
> path-system-type: contract violation
  expected: path-for-some-system?
  given: "/home"

The error is triggered from (path-convention-type ...) (racket/path.rkt:140) that only accepts path-for-some-system?
