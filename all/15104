>Description:
I noticed a typo in one license file, so I did a quick grep and there's
a bunch of them.  I don't know if it's supposed to be the library name
or not, but if it is, here are each of these, with the file name and the
first line:

    data-enumerate-lib/LICENSE.txt: data-lib
    images-doc/LICENSE.txt: images
    images-gui-lib/LICENSE.txt: images
    images-lib/LICENSE.txt: images
    pict-snip/LICENSE.txt: pict
    plot-compat/LICENSE.txt: plot
    plot-doc/LICENSE.txt: plot
    plot-gui-lib/LICENSE.txt: plot
    plot-lib/LICENSE.txt: plot
    redex-gui-lib/LICENSE.txt: redex-lib
    redex-pict-lib/LICENSE.txt: redex-lib
    scribble-html-lib/LICENSE.txt: scribble-text-lib
    string-constants/LICENSE.txt: gui
    string-constants-doc/LICENSE.txt: gui
    typed-racket-compatibility/LICENSE.txt: typed-racket-lib

These look more different:

    optimization-coach/LICENSE.txt: (LGPL)
    drracket/gui-debugger/LICENSE.txt: (unclear, looks like its just the icon)
    math-doc/LICENSE.txt: The math collection is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
    math-lib/LICENSE.txt: The math collection is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
