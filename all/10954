>Description:
This program:

#lang racket
(define (f x y #:y [z 0]) 0)
(f #f #:y 0)

produces this error message:

f: no case matching 1 non-keyword argument; x: expects type <x> as 1st argument, given: 'x; other arguments were: #f '#:y 0

Note that the section about x expecting type <x> is totally bogus.  

The bug appears to be the "hack" on line 935 of racket/private/kw, which is not working in the presence of the new Racket printer.  The error message is correct in #lang scheme.
