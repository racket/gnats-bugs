 Hi,
 
 What you're seeing is Racket forbidding assignment to module variables
 from outside that module.
 
 `trace` works by assigning `functionname`, which means that it can only
 be used from inside the module that defines the function. If you try
 `(trace functionname)` from inside the module that defines `functionname`,
 then it should work.
 
 `trace` adds tracing to all the identifiers it receives as arguments,
 which is why `(trace)` (without arguments) doesn't trace anything, but
 also doesn't raise an error.
 
 Because that's the intended behavior, I'll close this bug.
 
 I hope that explains the behavior you're seeing, and that the above
 solution works for your purposes.
 
 Thanks for the report!
 
 Vincent
