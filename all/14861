 I was curious about this error, so I tried this on my own machine but
 without any miniKanren stuff and it seems to be a more general problem.
 
 On Racket v6.1.1.6 (snapshot from 12/08) on Windows, the following
 errors:
 
   #lang racket
   (require Example)
 
 with this:
 
 ..\..\Program Files\Racket-6.1.1.6\collects\racket\path.rkt:14:0: simple-form-path: contract violation
   expected: path-string?
   given: #f
 
 This is with a dummy single-collection package "Example" installed. It
 errors in the expected way if the collection does not exist. Maybe a
 case-sensitivity issue?
 
 I also got the macro stepper to error at some point but can't seem to
 reproduce it.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Related: I can also install two packages "Example" and "example" that
 point to the same underlying directory.
 
 This can cause issues if you've installed these with the --copy flag in
 Windows because of case insensitivity (removing is a problem).

 I haven't been able to replicate the problem, yet. Can you tell me more
 about your single-collection "Example" package (does it have an
 "info.rkt" file, for example?) and the command line or GUI steps that
 you used to install it?

 This was just a single collection "Example" with a file like x.rkt in it
 (the contents don't seem to matter). I didn't have an info.rkt.
 
 I don't have my Windows machine on hand at the moment, but I think I
 installed it with the DrRacket package manager (from the DWIM tab).
 
 One factor that may matter is that I was using cygwin instead of the
 ordinary Windows cmdline to create the folders and files for the
 package.

 I was able to provoke the error. I'm not sure why I had trouble before,
 but the problem is in `path->pkg`.
 
 Thanks!

  | pkg/path: fix problems with `path->pkg` and case or nonexistent
  | 
  | The `path->pkg` funciton shouldn't return the name of a package that

  | installed. On Windows, where we match case-normalized paths, we have
  | to work a little harder to map a case-normalized path element to the
