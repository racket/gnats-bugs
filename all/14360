I can't install Racket 5.93 on my system:

DISTRIB_ID=LinuxMint
DISTRIB_RELEASE=15
DISTRIB_CODENAME=olivia
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux Mint 15 Olivia"

Linux duncan-laptop 3.8.0-19-generic #30-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 1 16:35:23 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Lenovo ThinkPad L520, i7, 8GB RAM.

The installer output is below:


This program will extract and install Racket v5.93.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is 401M.

Do you want a Unix-style distribution?
  In this distribution mode files go into different directories according
  to Unix conventions.  A "racket-uninstall" script will be generated
  to be used when you want to remove the installation.  If you say 'no',
  the whole Racket directory is kept in a single installation directory
  (movable and erasable), possibly with external links into it -- this is
  often more convenient, especially if you want to install multiple
  versions or keep it in your home directory.
Enter yes/no (default: no) > yes

Where do you want to base your installation of Racket v5.93?
  (If you've done such an installation in the past, either
   enter the same directory, or run 'racket-uninstall' manually.)
  1 - /usr/... [default]
  2 - /usr/local/...
  3 - ~/... (/home/duncan/...)
  4 - ./... (here)
  Or enter a different directory prefix to install in.

 I think we have fixed this problem in the latest v6.0 release
 candidate. I'll send you a separate message with a URL that you cantry.
 
 Thanks for the report!

 Thanks, this is indeed fixed in 6.0, at least on my system.
