>Description:
First encountered below Exercise 264 when tried to evaluate the example
((local ((define (f x) (+ (* 4 (sqr x)) 3))) f) 1)
and got the error message:
function call: expected a function after the open parenthesis, but found a part
Obviously it does refuse "(("

Encountered for the 2nd time when tried to evaluate lambda expressions in Chapter 17.1 such as
((lambda (x) (expt 10 x)) 2)
getting the same error message:
-------------------------------
> ((lambda (x) (expt 10 x)) 3)
function call: expected a function after the open parenthesis, but found a part
-------------------------------

The problem here is that the bug - if it is one - does not allow to play with lambda expressions ....
