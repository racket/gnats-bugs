>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
This errors:

#lang typed/racket
(define: x : Any (vector 1 2 3))
(if (vector? x) (vector-ref x 0) #f)

Type Checker: Polymorphic function vector-ref could not be applied to arguments:
Argument 1:
  Expected: (Vectorof a)
  Given:    Vector
Argument 2:
  Expected: Integer
  Given:    Zero
 in: (vector-ref x 0)


But this is fine:

#lang typed/racket
(define: x : Any (box 1))
(if (box? x) (unbox x) #f)


They should work the same way, since their predicates have nearly identical types, and a box is just a one-element vector.

> vector?
- : (Any -> Boolean : Vector)
#<procedure:vector?>
> box?
- : (Any -> Boolean : Box)
#<procedure:box?>
