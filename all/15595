>Description:
The button “Revisa la sintáxis” has got a spelling error: in Spanish, “sintaxis” is written without acute accent, due to the rule that every word with emphasize on the penultimate syllable and finishes with n, s or vocal, is not written with accent. In that way, the button should say “Revisa la sintaxis”
>How-To-Repeat:
Select the “Help” options, then select to use the interface in Spanish. The button is the one on the left of “Debug”, at the up right of the editor.
>Fix:
