>Description:
pointer to cstructs are not always equal? to each other even if they point to the same object. It fails when there are properties attached to the cstruct because the generic equal tries to compare the (different) wrapper structs.

ptr-equal? still works as expects because it unwraps the cpointers properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require ffi/unsafe racket/serialize)

;; --- no wrapper: OK
(define-cstruct _A ([a _int]))
(define a (make-A 123))

(equal? a (cast a _A-pointer _A-pointer))

> #t

;; -- wrapper: FAILS
(define-cstruct _B ([a _int]) #:property prop:serializable #f)
(define b (make-B 123))

(equal? b (cast b _B-pointer _B-pointer))  ; cast forces new wrapper
