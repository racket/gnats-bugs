>Description:
(This is probably two bugs: one related to evaluation and one related to the gui handling.)

A program that contains a submodule path including ".." causes Check Syntax to report an error even when evaluation of the program succeeds. Furthermore, an error raised by "offline" Check Syntax causes the definition window to become permanently inaccessible.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following program in the DrRacket definitions window:

#lang racket
(module X racket
  (define x 1)
  (provide x))
(module Y racket
  (require (submod ".." X))
  (define y (add1 x)))

Online Check Syntax will display the following error at the bottom of the frame: 

  standard-module-name-resolver: too many ".."s in submodule path: (submod (quote |expanded module|) ".." X)

Click the Run button. The program runs without errors.

Click the Check Syntax button. DrRacket pops up an error dialog with the same error as before. Dismiss the error dialog.

Click the Run button again. The program runs without errors, but the definition window is blanked, and nothing I've tried has restored it.

 I think the root cause of the error (or at least something closely 
 related) might be the following: if an reference is extracted from an 
 expanded submodule within an expanded module, and if the reference's 
 binding comes from another submodule reached via "..", then 
 'free-identifier=?' raises an error when given that identifier.
 
 Some code to demonstrate:
 
 (define s
    #'(module A racket
        (#%plain-module-begin
         (module X racket
           (#%plain-module-begin
            (define-values (x) 1)
            (#%provide x)))
         (module Y racket
           (#%plain-module-begin
            (#%require (submod "." ".." X))
            x)))))
 
 (define expanded-s (expand s))
 
 (define x-ref
    (syntax-case expanded-s (module #%plain-module-begin)
      [(module _ _
         (#%plain-module-begin
          (module . _)
          (module _ _ (#%plain-module-begin _req x))))
       #'x]))
 
 (free-identifier=? x-ref x-ref)
 ;; => standard-module-name-resolver: too many ".."s in submodule path: 
 (submod (quote |expanded module|) ".." X)
 
 If that's supposed to be a normalized submodule path, then the ".." 
 shouldn't be there.

 When I click "check syntax" with the example, I get the stacktrace
 below, which suggests that free-identifier-mapping-get is what is
 raising this error. The docs claim that it will not raise an error (if
 I supply a non-error raising thunk, which I have in this case), so
 something is going wrong there.
 
 And, just to clarify, when DrRacket raises an error during certain GUI
 callbacks at times when it is not expecting to raise an error
 (specifically those where it has called begin-edit-sequence but not
 yet called end-edit-sequence) then the editor is wedged. That is what
 has happened in this case.
 
 (Relatedly, it is helpful to include any stacktraces you get when you
 report these errors, especially "internal errors" like this one).

 Looks like the error is being raised by free-identifier=? when it
 compares these two identifiers in the program:
 
 #<syntax:/Users/robby/tmp4.rkt:4:10 x> vs #<syntax:/Users/robby/tmp4.rkt:7:17 x>
 
 Those are the one in the 'provide' in the 'X' module and the one in
 the argument to add1 in the 'Y' module.

 Okay, here's a small program demonstrating the problem. If this is the
 correct behavior, then probably I'll need a little more help here.

 (define str #<<--

 (module X racket
  (define x 1)

                            [read-accept-reader #t])
               (expand (read prt))))
 (define xs '())
 (let loop ([stx stx])
   (syntax-case stx ()
     [x
      (eq? 'x (syntax-e #'x))
      (set! xs (cons #'x xs))]

                    (list-ref xs 1))
