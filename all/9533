>Description:
On that page, it says type the line:

#lang scheme

and hit run; however, I could only get that to
work if the lanauge=module was specified first.
Only after reading a little further on intro.html
is there any hint that language=module is
required.  That hint should come *before*
the 'click the Run button' instruction.
>How-To-Repeat:
Select some language besides module (e.g. 
Beginning Student) and enter '#lang scheme'
in def window and hit Run.  This produces
an error message with no hint about how
to correct the error.

Reason>>> The relevant information is in the subsequent paragraph,
which seems quite reasonable.
