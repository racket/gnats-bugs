>Description:
Please add match-define to the default list of Define-like Keywords; match*, match-lambda, and match-lambda* to the default list of Cond-like Keywords; and match-let (and variants) to the default list of Letrec-like Keywords in the editor.  These forms are very useful, and square brackets increase their readability immensely; users shouldn't have to configure them manually.
