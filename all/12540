>Description:
If you try to add a Teachpack through the DrRacket GUI, but your Definitions window contains the line
#lang racket
a little modal window will pop up that says:

=================================================

Teachpacks are only available in these languages:
Die Macht der Abstraktion -
+ some other oddly formatted text.

==================================================

Unfortunately, this lead me to hold the mistaken belief that the teachpacks were not available in the racket language. After all, why would such a message pop up 
otherwise?

=========================================================

I've marked it as serious because I spent two years(!) with an unfortunate misconception as a result of this very window. You may well think it less severe.

 We are currently in the unfortunate situation of understanding now how
 we should have done things 10 years ago. Unfortunately, the transition
 time is long and we try to have something reasonable during that
 interim.
 
 If you have any advice on how we could, say, improve the documentation
 (or anything else) to help people such as your former self, that would
 be great.
 
 Also, I'm not sure it is clear to you yet, as "teachpacks" per se are
 not available in the racket language; they are only available in the
 "beginning student" (and similar) languages. In the racket language,
 you have to use 'require'.

 The only change requested here is to add the word 'menu' between 'Teachpacks' and 'are' 
 
 If you want to be very nice, you can add 'in other languages, use require instead'

 Yes and no.  "Teachpacks" are just ordinary Racket libraries, but with a special alternative way to specify them.  The picturing-programs library, for example, can be specified in any Racket-looking language by saying "(require picturing-programs)".  In the student languages you can also specify it by going to the Teachpacks menu and choosing it from a menu.  The effect is pretty much the same.
