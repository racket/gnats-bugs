 Just a comment from the sidelines: it looks like in the world where such
 issues should be well-discussed (the JS world), the overwhelming
 collective response to such issues is a shrug and then mumbling
 something about how you should really make sure that whoever generates
 your input should have made it a proper JSON.  They even go to implement
 hacks in the style of "if you have one JSON object per line, then simply
 wrap it in []s, replace the newlines with commas, then read the whole
 thing".
 
 Not a concrete answer, but at least for now there is no agreement on
 whether this would make any sense.  (JSON.parse() will, of course, throw
 an error since it's expecting a single JSON object.)

 The JSON standard at json.org allow JSON values to be sent. They don’t restrict this to parenthesized stuff. 
 
 My impression is that JSON is the teenage-heartbreak language of data exchange, as ill-defined and as ill-designed as Python.

 The JSON specification is perfectly well-defined, and actually
 decently well-designed, but this isn't one of the things it specifies.
 In particular, the JSON spec itself only defines when a sequence of
 characters is legal JSON, so it doesn't specify the behavior of
 something like `read-json`. The JS standard, which defines
 JSON.parse(), doesn't define it to be read-like (one of the best
 features of Racket's json library).
 
 But given the JSON spec, the first four characters of your test case
 are a JSON document, and so I think `read-json` should behave the way
 you expect. Maybe the word-boundary parts of the regexps here:
 https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/master/racket/collects/json/main.rkt#L179-L181
 could just be removed, and everything would still work. Seems like the
 right thing to test.

 So what happens when a hash table contains the same key twice? How is this supposed to be mapped to a data representation? I can enumerate a few more such things. The worst aspect is that it does not specify which parts are JSON ‘messages’ and whether such things have to separated by white space or newlines or whatever.

 I think we should then also accept truetrue as two JSON messages, each conveying true.

 And *this* (the fact that it isn't) is why I completely agree with
 Matthias.  It's more like a cultural mentality than a spec.  I don't
 expect such an issue to go undiscussed in any kind of a lisp circle, but
 in JS the lack of anything about it is very surprising given how many
 more eyeballs went through these things.

 That looks reasonable to me.  But I wouldn't be surprised if there are
 also tests that should be adjusted.  (I *do* remember being aware of
 this failing, and intentionally keeping those `\\b`s.)

 As you say below, it's important not to confuse a PL
 serialization/deserialization library with JSON, which is simply a
 grammar for a text format. JSON-the-text-format (specified by
 Ecma-404, here:
 http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf
 ) allows duplicate keys but intentionally does not specify how to map
 things to a data format.
 
 Individual language bindings for JSON can specify this, as the JS one
 does, but this is an intentional choice by JSON not to specify an
 object model (XML, in contrast, specifies a quite complicated object
 model), not an accident of ill-definedness.

 Right, I was explicitly distinguishing them.

 I agree -- those are the lines you should look at to fix this.
