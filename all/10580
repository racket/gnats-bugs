>Description:
Suggested changes are between @@@ markers in the copied text.  Hope this is helpful.


4.12 Simple Dispatch: case
...
Multiple datums can be supplied for each clause, and the corresponding expr is evaluated of @@@ of-->if @@@ any of the datums match.

5.2 Copying and Update
The struct-id that appears after struct-copy must be a structure type name bound by define-struct (i.e., the name that cannot be used directly as an expression). The struct-expr must produce an instance of the structure type. The result is a new instance of the structure tpe @@@ tpe-->type@@@ that is like the old one, except that the field indicated by each field-id gets the value of the corresponding expr.

5.6 Opaque versus Transparent Stucture Types
an instance of the structure type prints in a way that does not show any information about the fields @@@ fields-->fields' @@@ values.

6.4 Inports: require

[I am not certain about this one]
(require (except-in (prefix m: 'm) m:ghost))  ;@@@ prefix-->prefix-in @@@ ?

7.1.4 Experimenting with Examples
All of the contracts and module @@@ module-->modules @@@ in this chapter (excluding those just following) are written using the standard #lang syntax for describing modules.

7.2.2 Arrows
So -> says “this is a contract for a function.” What follows in a function contracts @@@ a function --> function OR contracts --> contract @@@ are contracts (sub-contracts if you wish) that tell the reader what kind of arguments to expect and what kind of a result the function produces. 

7.3.3 Rest Arguments
Since the remainder of the actual arguments are collected in a list for a rest parameter such as rst, the contract demands a list of values; in this specific examples, @@@ examples-->example @@@ these values must be numbers.

7.4.1 Promising Something About a Specific Structure
Yes. If your module defines a variable to be a structure, then on export you can specify the structures shape:  @@@structures-->structure's @@@

7.6 Examples
While we reformulate Mitchell and McKim’s terminology and we use a mostly applicative @@@ -->implementation @@@ , we retain their terminology of “classes” and “objects”:

For each query and command, decide on @@@ -->a @@@ suitable pre-condition contract.
OR
For each query and command, decide on @@@ -->a @@@ suitable pre-condition contract @@@ contract-->contracts @@@.

11.1 Sequence Constructors

The in-range function generates a sequence of numbers, given an optional starting number (which defaults to 0), a number before which the sequences ends,@@@ sequences-->sequence @@@ OR @@@ end-->ends @@@  and an optional step (which defaults to 1).

12 PAttern matching
An ellipsis, written ..., act like a Kleene star within a list or vector pattern: the preceding sub-pattern can be used to match any number of times for any number of consecutive elements of the list of @@@ of-->or @@@ vector.
