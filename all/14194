>Description:
If a cookie's value is something like

"hello \"world\""

the cookie parser in request-cookies parses this as a client-cookie with value

hello \"world\"

So the actual string is, when printed, "hello \\\"world\\\"".

However, I believe the correct value should be

hello "world"

so the actual string would be "hello \"world\"".

Came across this while using request-id-cookie, took a while to track down the bug was in the string parsing...
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a servlet which responds to "setcookie" with a http Set-Cookie header, setting cookie="hello \"world\"".

Then have the servlet respond to "getcookie" by printing out the value of the cookie with name "cookie".
