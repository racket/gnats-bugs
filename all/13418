>Description:
Making hashtables of any type other than (HashTable Integer Integer) fails with for/hash: and for/fold:.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following 2 programs fail:

(for/hash: : (HashTable Integer String) ([i : Integer '(1 2 3)])
  (values i "s"))

(for/fold: : (HashTable Integer String)
  ([h : (HashTable Integer String) #hash()]) ([i '(1 2 3)])
  (hash-set h i "s"))
