>Description:
When using sequence/c and hash/c inside an or/c contract, Racket sometimes reports that multiple clauses of the or/c might both match, even when they clearly won't.
>How-To-Repeat:
; this errors no matter what parameters are passed to sequence/c

 I think this is a problem with sequence/c's first-order-contract-passes?
 implementation. It should only return #t on hashtable instances if the
 sequence contains exactly two values.
