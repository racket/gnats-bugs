  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/0e4db0a7f0
  | web pages: fix platform sorting on download pages
  | 
  | Fix use of wrong array element during sort, where using the wrong element
  | caused "Windows source" to be sorted before "Windows (x86, 32-bit)".
  | (The wrong-element bug was introduced with changed to support the button
  | that downloads directly from the default mirror.)
  | 
  | Closes PR 14655 and PR 14656
