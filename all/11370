>Description:
Consider the program below, and the same one with the signature for `find' commented out.  Running

(find flights "foo")

produces

procedure application: expected procedure, given: "foo"; arguments were: "Denver"

which is what I'd expect.  But put the signature back in, and you get

procedure application: expected procedure, given: (void); arguments were: "Denver"
>How-To-Repeat:
(define Graph (signature (list-of node)))
(define-struct node (data adj))
(define flights
  (shared ([DEN (make-node "Denver" (list DEN))])
    (list DEN)))

(: find (Graph (%a -> Boolean) -> node))
(define (find g p)
  (cond
    [(empty? g) (error "unable to find node")]
    [(cons? g) (if (p (node-data (first g)))
                   (first g)
                   (find (rest g) p))]))

(define (find-string s)
  (Î» (n) (string=? n s)))
