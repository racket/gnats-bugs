 Update on error message:
 
 I get different error messages depending on whether I quote the URL.
 
 $ osascript -e "open location =

 identifier. (-2740)
 
 The first variant (quoted) is what Cmd-R in RacketApp does.

 I have another student who has this same error, running macOS Sierra.
 
 Removing the :8000 does not fix the error, nor does trying https.

 I’m now seeing this as well. 
 
 Here’s my output:
 
 0:98: execution error: "file:///Users/clements/Library/Racket/development/doc/search/index.html?q=dkauffma" doesn’t understand the “open location” message. (-1708)
 browser-run: process execute failed: '(#<path:/usr/bin/osascript> "-e" "open location \"file:///Users/clements/Library/Racket/development/doc/search/index.html?q=dkauffma\”")
 
 You can also see this behavior independently of DrRacket by just calling osascript from the command-line:
 
 hardy% osascript -e "open location \"file:///Users/clements/Library/Racket/development/doc/search/index.html?q=dkauffma\""
 0:98: execution error: "file:///Users/clements/Library/Racket/development/doc/search/index.html?q=dkauffma" doesn’t understand the “open location” message. (-1708)
 
 …
 
 Okay, I’m back from searching the interwebs, and I’m delighted to announce that this problem may go away in the next iteration of the OS (10.12.6):
 
 http://bugs.python.org/issue30392
 
 Of course, that means that F1 is broken for the next six months … :(

 It’s going to be a long six months; the scribble html button doesn’t work any more either, along with F1 and command-line “raco docs”.
