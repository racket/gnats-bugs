>Description:
See repro steps
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following into a file named repro.rkt, then do "racket repro.rkt" at the shell.  At least on Linux, you'll see the process print "Racket virtual machine has run out of memory; aborting", and you'll get a non-zero exit status.

You should instead see the message "Keepin' on keepin' on", and a zero exit status.

#lang racket

(require racket/sandbox)

(define evaluator (make-evaluator '(begin (require racket))))

(with-handlers ([exn:fail?
                 (lambda (e)
                   (displayln (exn-message e)))])
  (evaluator "(require ffi/unsafe) (require ffi/cvector) (make-cvector _int 1000000000)"))
(displayln "Keepin' on keepin' on")
