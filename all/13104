>Description:
On Windows, when you go to File | Install .plt File..., and then
Browse (for the local filesystem), the default is to search for only
.rkt files ("Racket Sources").  Since by definition that's not what
the user is looking for, this can be a bit confusing -- the file looks
like it just isn't there until you notice this setting.  Also, the
only alternative is "all types", which can be a lot of junk.  Ideally
it should default to .plt files, at which point there's probably very
few and what the user wants is *right there*.

NB: This was on a pristine v5.3 install, but it's just possible
there's something in my usage history and this doesn't happen for
other users.

>How-To-Repeat:
Go to File | Install .plt.  See "Racket Sources" and "all types" as the
only options, the former of which doesn't pick up .plt.
