>Description:
In the Typed Scheme guide, section 4.7.1 "Polymorphic Data Structures", there is the following text:

"The second definition

  (define-struct: (a) Some ([v : a]))

creates a parameterized type, Just, which is a structure with one element, whose type is that of the type argument to Just."

I think the text should be referring to "Some", not "Just".
