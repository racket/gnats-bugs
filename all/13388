>Description:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server-internal/web-server.html?q=web-server/web-server#(def._((lib._web-server/servlet-dispatch..rkt)._dispatch/servlet))

has the example

(define (start-file-server base)
  (serve
   #:dispatch
   (files:make
    #:url->path (make-url->path base)
    #:path->mime-type
    (lambda (path)
      #"application/octet-stream"))
   #:port 8080))

But files:make is not bound by requiring the library being described.

Reason>>> Nor is make-url->path or a wide variety of other bindings 
that come from libraries like racket/list in many 
documentation examples. Nevertheless, the documentation cross 
references provide you a link to the relevant modules to get 
the requires to run the example.

I don't think it is reasonable to have a giant list of 
requires at the top every tiny example and if you do, then 
there are many more examples than this that need "fixing". I 
suggest you submit a patch if you think so.

 I filed this bug because I believe that examples should just work with
 copying and pasting (with the require lines of the documenting library in a
 #lang racket file). I as a person who understands how racket works can look
 up the cross referencing, but a new person to racket might not get that.
 
 The fact that files:make has been renamed would make it even more confusing
 to someone who doesn't understand racket all that well.

 I support this basic principle. So perhaps the example should be changed.

 An idea that might work at some point is to have some "copy" button
 that will get more code in so that examples can have working code
 while only some part is visible.  I don't think that this is practical
 ATM though -- last time I looked into doing this it was only possible
 with a flash thing.

 It seems like we can work around such things. A "full program" button that
 opens up a window that one can copy and paste from, for example, seems
 doable.

 Oh, that's *very* easy to do.  If anyone wants to look at how to do
 it, see the CSS and little JS code that makes the triangles on the TOC
 show/hide the text under them.
 
 (BTW, a half-way convenience is to make the button also select the
 text, so the user only needs to hit C-v to get it.  (The problem with
 copying is atht browsers don't allow that.))

 Also for those users on some flavors of linux, selecting the text is enough
 to get it into one of the copy buffers. I have seen websites do auto
 selecting on a click, and it is very useful. So +1 to auto selecting.
