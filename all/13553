>Description:
This example matches and produces #t, which is expected:

(match* ((list 1 3) (list 8 1))
  [((list-no-order n _ ...)
    (list-no-order n _ ...)) #t])

But this, which should be equivalent, fails to match:

(match* ((list 1 3) (list 8 1))
  [((app identity (list-no-order n _ ...))
    (app identity (list-no-order n _ ...))) #t])

Note that this works as expected, so it seems to be the combination
of app, list-no-order, and non-linear uses of pattern variables:

(match* ((list 1 3) (list 1 8))
  [((app identity (list n _ ...))
    (app identity (list n _ ...))) #t])
