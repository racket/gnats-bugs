>Description:
I installed racket6.1 on my LinuxMint17 just now and I put the links in /usr/share/applications/, but I can't launch drracket by clicking the link. So I opened the link file with vim and I found this line "Exec=../../bin/drracket -singleInstance", which I thought was not adaptive to link file, because the relative path acturally functioned by the origin file in /opt/racket/share/applications/. So I replaced the link with the origin file and it worked.
