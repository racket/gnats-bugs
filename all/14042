 Thanks for the report! This looks like a duplicate of PR 13720:
   http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&audit-trail&database=default&pr=13720
 
 The bug has been fixed in git (but didn't make it into 5.3.6), so I will
 go ahead and close this PR.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Thanks for the report.  This has already been fixed in the pre-release
