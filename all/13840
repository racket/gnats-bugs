>Description:
When I set the to-draw speed as 1/512, it was still fine. When I upped it to 1/1024, DrRacket is sort of wedged: the animation window can't be closed or killed, Command-backtick doesn't cycle DrRacket windows properly, etc.

Since this seems a natural thing for students to want to do (Tara kept wanting me to make Thomas go "faster"), this seems like something to protect against better.

 Would it be okay if I restricted the rate to something between [1/100,LARGE] ?

 I think this is a priority problem. Probably the refresh events should go
 at whatever the user asks but have lower priority than the clicking events.

 There is no clicking event involved here. There is only one kind of =
 event the program deals with: clock ticks.=20
 
 As for the speed of clock ticks, I think that there are physical limits =
 on the rate and we should simply acknowledge them.=20

 Would it be okay if I restricted the rate to something between [1/100,LARGE] ?<br>

 &gt; *** Description:<br>
 &gt; When I set the to-draw speed as 1/512, it was still fine. When I upped it to 1/1024, DrRacket is sort of wedged: the animation window can't be closed or killed, Command-backtick doesn't cycle DrRacket windows properly, etc.<br>
