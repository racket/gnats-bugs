>Description:
I had re-written a few lines of code before saving, and DrRacket crashed.  Upon opening DrRacket, it attempted an auto-recovery which failed, and deleted my project with it.  I unfortunately did not make a back-up.  Is this a known issue? 
>How-To-Repeat:
Crash DrRacket before saving file
Attempt auto-recovery
