>Description:
As someone new to continuations it took me a long time to figure out the difference between call-with-composable-continuation and call-with-current-continuation.

A simple example to show the difference like the following would help.

(+ 100
   (call-with-composable-continuation
    (λ (k) (+ 1000 (k 1)))))  -> 1201

(+ 100
   (call-with-current-continuation
    (λ (k) (+ 1000 (k 1)))))   -> 101
