>Description:
I'm using a modified keyboard layout on OSX. The remapping works for any program so far but DrRacket. When I try to input numbers on DrRacket it won't work. My numbers are mapped as Option + Key, with key being one of those: "UIOJKLM,. " (mapping to 7894561230 in order). For example, Option + U inputs the number 7 in every program but DrRacket, in which nothing happens.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start OSX (tested from version 10.7.5).
2. Download my keyboard layout: http://tinyurl.com/9lfl3kc . Alternativelly, create a keyboard layout (I used the software Ukelele) which maps Option + U to 7.
3. Assert Option + U inputs 7 in other programs.
4. Try to input 7 pressing Option + U on DrRacket. It won't work.
