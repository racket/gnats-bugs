>Description:
I run racket in an environment setup with:
PLTCOMPILEDROOTS=/Users/endobson/proj/racket/compile-root/@(version)/

This allows me to use multiple versions of racket at the same time and not polute my source directories with compiled files (makes recursive grep a pain).

The issue is that on install a new version of racket from a prebuilt package (dmg), the installation procedure is just to copy the directory into my Applications folder. This does not setup the compiled files so that the commandline can find them, and when I try to do a raco setup it doesn't find them either and so recompiles everything from source.

I don't know of a great solution, but filing the bug in case others do.

 Does adding ":" to the end of PLTCOMPILEDROOTS fix the problem?

 That allows it to load up fast. Will this ever cause zo files to get
 written to the local compiled directory or just read from there?

 It should work the way you want for `raco make`: ".zo" files should
 always go to the first element of the PLTCOMPILEDROOTS search path, but
 only when an up-to-date ".zo" file is not found at any point in the
 search path.
 
 Does it actually work that way for you?

 It at least found the up to date .zo files later in the seach path, I
 haven't tried with raco make yet. But I found out that using an existing
 distribution wasn't actually a good solution to my problem. (I ran into
 host/target issues where the version numbers of the thing I compiled with
 were different than the one that was reading the trace, and so I ended up
 just compiling a new git repo.)
