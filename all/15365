>Description:
I finally figured out something that has been a hard to see annoyance
for years...  When selecting text with C+S+Home, DrRacket will also copy
the text -- the reason this has been a continuous annoyance is that what
I do (often in class, with no time to figure things out) is:

1. Copy text from some place

2. Go to DrRacket, press C+End, then C+S+Home, then S+Insert

3. See no change

4. Go back to other window, loop back (which would usually work since
   I'd skip step 2).

Instead, copying could happen as does in Emacs: copy only if using the
mouse to do the selection, but not when the keyboard is used.
Alternatively, modernify DrR on Linux and require an explicit copying
operation.

Another weird behavior that I see now: when using S+Up or S+Down to
select lines (no other keys), only the first-marked line gets copied.
For example, if your buffer has:

    A
    B
    C

(with a newline following the C) and the cursor is at the end, repeating
C+Up a few times and a S+Insert pasting will leave you with just a C
line.  This, however, is not always the same, and looks like it depends
if DrR has the current clipboard, or something similar.  In any case,
this looks inconsistent enough that I'm guessing that nobody relies on
the auto-copy behavior so requiring an explicit copying operation is not
going to surprise anyone.

 Thanks!
 
 Any chance of also fixing the thing where A-S-left/right generates a
 selection that cannot be made smaller using S-left/right?

 What is the name of the key binding that you are talking about, please?
 (You can find that out in the "edit|show keybindingbs" menu item.)

 1. It's `select-backward-sexp` that I was talking about, but it looks
    like that's part is fixed...  (Side note: the search thing in that
    list could be improved by splitting the entered text on spaces and
    searching for something that has all of the texts, so "sel back sexp"
    would find it.)
 
 2. When I was looking for the bug, I found it with a description of when
    it actually (still) happens.  Find it here:
 
        http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view%20audit-trail&pr=13342
 
    and my description of when it still happens in my reply (look for
    "From: Eli").  You also explain there the reason that it happens.
 
 3. (Final sub-note: the bug that I mentioned there with C-S-left/right
    not working over empty lines is still in too...)

 Can you tell me what the name of the keystroke in point 3 is?

 Oh, it must be backward-select-word. I think this is a bug in
 find-wordbreak. Here's a test case:
 
 #lang racket/base
 (require racket/gui/base racket/class)
 (define t (new text%))
 (send t insert "a\nb\n\nc\n")
 (send t set-position 5 7)
 (define b (box 5))
 (send t find-wordbreak b #f 'caret)
 (unbox b)
 
 I think that program should produce 2, not 5.
 
 If you change the string constant to "a\nbc\nc\n", then it does
 produce 2, not 5 and my read of the docs suggests that find-workbreak
 should do the same thing in both cases.
 
 If find-wordbreak is right, then perhaps this call is wrong in the way
 it uses the result or in the way it calls find-wordbreak, however:
 
 (send t move-position 'left #t 'word)
 
 Just replace the call to find-wordbreak with that call and you'll see
 also the 2/5 in the two strings (but that I think should be the same).
