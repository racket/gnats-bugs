>Description:
I was following the HtC offered on EDx, and everything was going fine, learning (+ 3 3) and (+ 3 4) and (* 3 3) and then I wrote this function (sqrt(+(* 3 3)(* 4 4))). And quickly my computer crashes, and restarts giving me the TRAP_KERNEL_NODE or something along those lines. Just having Racket open does not cause these problems.
