>Description:
Hi guys,

Running the stepper when the Definitions window contains a (big-bang ...) in which the world is an expression that builds a struct, I get this error in the Stepper window:

annotate/inner: this region of code is still under construction

This occurs in at least v4.2.4 and v4.2.3.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; Enter in Definitions:

(define-struct foo ())

(big-bang (make-foo))

;; Then click "Step".
