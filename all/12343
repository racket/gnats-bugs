Computer Language: (("Determine language from source") (#(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang racket\n" #t #t))
>Description:
In my current build, evaluating a buffer
written in the #lang racket language results
in a REPL that can't evaluate anything, e.g.
the constant 13.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just to make sure I'm running a Clean DrRacket:

1) unset PLTCOLLECTS.
2) move ~/Library/Racket
3) move ~/Library/Preferences/*racket*

The bug:

4) start drracket
5) Choose "Use Language Declared in Source"
6) Run
7) In REPL, evaluate 13
... get this error message: 

compile: unbound identifier (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) at: module in: (module program racket/base)
