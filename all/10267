>Description:
DrScheme fails during the loading stage of startup (window appears with taskbar; failure about 2/3 of the way complete with bar) with the console message:

5/27/09 5:50:20 PM [0x0-0x5fe5fe].org.plt-scheme.DrScheme[74378] default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/var/tmp/plt/collects/typed-scheme/utils/tc-utils.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2) 

I'd guess that this is a problem with the new typed-scheme code not getting re-locatable, or another program depending on a file which was in typed-scheme, but is now removed.  (Note that I have never had any files in a /var/tmp/plt directory, so this path must be coming from the build computer.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Download today's PLT Scheme Full pre-release package, and start up DrScheme.

 This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 2440 and 3156)

 I found today that this problem can be fixed by running
 
 setup-plt -c # To clean
 setup-plt    # To bootstrap
 
 Is it possible that there are some out-of-date zo's in the build which  
 refer to an old build directory?
 
 Thanks,
 Will
