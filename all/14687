>Description:
If one creates a text box and places text in it, search seems to find that text, but does not highlight it: neither circling it while typing the term, nor highlighting it when finding the next and prev item.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file of the following form:

;; this is some text

(comment box containing "this is some text")

;; this is some text


Control-F to search, and type in t-e-x-t.  The two ;; commented instances of "text" are circled.  The comment box is not.  Nonetheless, when one goes to next and prev, the highlight circle stays on one of these two an extra click, rather than lightening and heavily circling the instance of "text" in the text box.

  | simplify and extend the find-string method in text%
  | 
  | This implementation runs about 10% faster than the old when searching
  | for "Î»" in (collection-file-path "unit.rkt" "drracket" "private"). It
  | is copied directly from the search search algorithm from Wikipedia
  | called Knuth-Morris-Pratt, but with a fancier version of get-char that
  | cooperates with text%'s snip interface for more efficient linear
  | scans of characters.
  | 
  | It also generalizes the previous one by supporting searching into
  | embedded text% objects inside editor-snip% objects
