Computer Language: (("Determine language from source") (#(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t none) (default) #() "#lang racket\n" #t #f ((main) (test))))
>Description:
They probably add a clause [i (in-range len)].
>How-To-Repeat:
The four tests in the following program fail:


#lang racket

(require racket/flonum
         rackunit)

(define flvector-iters 0)
(check-equal? (for/flvector #:length 4 ()
                (set! flvector-iters (+ 1 flvector-iters))
                1.2)
              (flvector 1.2 0.0 0.0 0.0))
(check-equal? flvector-iters 1)

(define vector-iters 0)
(check-equal? (for/vector #:length 4 ()
                (set! vector-iters (+ 1 vector-iters))
                3.4)
              (vector 3.4 0 0 0))
(check-equal? vector-iters 1)
