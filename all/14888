>Description:
Try running the following in a REPL or sandboxed evaluator:

  (make-prefab-struct '(foo 5 bar 2999999999999999) 1)

it will use up a large amount of memory and become unresponsive.

This seems to happen even in a sandboxed environment (I tested this
with a copy of rudybot running on my machine) with resource limits.
