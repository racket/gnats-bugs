>Description:
I wanted to adjust the font size and terminal colors in a newly installed version of Racket, the latest stable release, 6.0. As soon as I select preferences from the edit menu, the window disappears.

I am using OpenSUSE 13.1. I recompiled the source using both shared libraries (configure --prefix=/opt/racket-6.0 --enable-shared) and static linking (configure --prefix=/opt/racket-6.0), and I had the problem under both conditions. The problem is synchronous and happens every time that I try to open preferences.

I ran DrRacket from the command-line, and when I select preferences, I get the following error output on the terminal:

(drracket:24086): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_signal_connect_data: assertion 'G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed

(drracket:24086): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_signal_connect_data: assertion 'G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed

SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0x3e00
Abort
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start racket from the command-line.

2. Select Edit -> Preferences from the menus.

(At this point, the interpreter window simply disappears and the program crashes with the above error output.)

 Can you run in a debugger so we can get a stack trace? You'll want to
 do something like this:
 
 % gdb `which racket`
 (gdb) handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint
 (gdb) set args -l drracket
 (gdb) run
 
 That should get drracket going and then when you make it crash, you
 should be able to type:
 
 (gdb) bt
 
 and maybe the output of that will help us understand the problem.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 That's probably not necessary in this case. I'm pretty sure we've fixed
 this crashing problem for the upcoming v6.0.1 release.
 
 Joseph: You could double-check by trying a snapshot from one of the
 sites listed here:

 Thanks for the report!

 Hi,=20
 
 
 I compiled and installed version 6.0.1.5 from the linked website, and the p=
 references problem doesn't appear to exist in that version. If you'd like, =
 I can still generate the debugging output for the last version. Thanks,=20
