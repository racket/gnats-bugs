Problem: 
 write a function without test cases
 use (>= 300) in the body, which is checked at run-time not at syntax time 
 RUN, see the entire function covered in black
 use the function in conjunction with some higher-order import
 the function fails, writes an error message, and in principle, the 
   high-lighting exists 

BUT students can't see it because the test coverage color 
hides the highlighting color.

 That is not what I see in SVN. Here's what I did:
 
 1) set the language to beginner.
 2) put this program in the definitions window: (define (f x) (>=3D 300))
 3) hit run. noticed the test coverage color
 4) in the interactions window ran (f 1), and then I saw the test
 coverage color go away to be replaced with a pink highlighting in the
 same place.

 Oh, I see I missed "in conjuction with some higher-order import", but
 this program:
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 (define (f x) (>= 300))
 (run-simulation f)
 
 also gives me pink, both running in the definitions window (as above),
 but also when I put the run-simulation call into the interactions
 window.

 Here is a program that's closer to what I observed in the middle  
 school lab. (I don't have the code, and I am not sure which version  
 of drs  the girl used).
 
 ;; ---- teachpack
 #lang scheme
 
 (require 2htdp/universe lang/prim)
 
 (define (move w k)
    (cond
      [(key=? "left" k) (- w 5)]
      [(key=? "right" k) (+ w 5)]
      [else w]))
 
 (define (draw w)
    (place-image (circle 3 'solid 'red) w 10 (empty-scene 200 20)))
 
 
 (define (start f)
    (big-bang 50 (on-key move) (on-draw draw) (stop-when f)))
 
 (provide-higher-order-primitive start (stop?))
 ;; ---- end teachpack
 
 (define (f x)
    (or (<= x 10)
        (>= 100)))
 
 When you RUN this program, you get a pretty 'black' picture. However,  
 she then launched (start f) and of course the program crashed.
 
 In her drscheme: things stayed black. The pink wasn't visible.
 In svn head drscheme, the black goes away, the pink shows up.
 
 I can think of two explanations:
 
 1. At some point we changed how test coverage works (doesn't work/ 
 does work for things launched from repl), and for some reason, this  
 girl's drscheme didn't unhighlight the untested part. So that's what  
 I observed.
 
 2. Emmanuel's teachpack uses a different mechanism for exporting this  
 higher-order primitive and it somehow interferes with test coverage.  
 I have cc'ed Emmanuel because he wrote the CitizenSchool teachpack (a  
 derivative of world) that was used last week.
 
 As far as I am concerned, we can close the bug report for now. --
