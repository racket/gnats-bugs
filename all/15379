>Description:
I have the problem that my scrolling speed is ridiculously fast and it makes the program really hard to use. I've downloaded older versions as well but the problem is still there aswell. Using a Mac book air. Changing the scroll speed in OS doesn't do anything as well. Is there a solution to reduce the speed?

 I’m also experiencing this. It’s very strange. It may be related to recent updates to the operating system.
