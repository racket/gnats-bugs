>Description:
I downloaded and installed version 4.1.4 for my PPC Mac at home with no difficulty, but when I tried to do it for my Intel Mac, I got "The following disk images failed to mount: plt-4.1.4-bin-i386-osx-mac.dmg .   Reason: codec overrun"

I tried downloading and installing the Windows version (running on my Intel Mac) and got "Installer integrity check has failed.  Common causes include incomplete download and damaged media.  Contact the installer's author to obtain a new copy."  Same thing when I tried it on a "real" Windows machine.
