>Description:
When the same named ellipsis is used in the main pattern of a reduction relation rule and in a where clause within that rule, Redex gives the error "ellipsis cannot have an underscore in ..._n". Taking away the name on either ellipsis makes the problem go away. This worked as recently as 6.0.0.5.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following:

#lang racket

(require redex/reduction-semantics)

(define-language L)

(define rel
  (reduction-relation L
    (--> ((a ..._n))
         2
         (where (b ..._n) 1))))

  | redex: allow named ellipses to be bound as term-ids.
  | 
  | This enables the internal bindings generated by where clauses.
