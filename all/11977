>Description:
After a "Run" the focus moves to the definitions window even if
it's not displayed.  This can be pretty bad in the below
scenario.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type any code that will lead to an error with a known source
   like:  #lang racket (let () (error 'x) 1)

2. Hit Ctrl+D to see only the interactions.

3. Hit Ctrl+T to run the code and see the error.

4. Pretend to be a newbie -- type some more expressions and hit
   enter.  Pretend to be a frustrated newbie and hit random
   keys in your imaginary fight to figure out what's wrong.

5. Hit Ctrl-T and get some weird error.  (Since the last step
   added random junk to your code.)
