>Description:
This is again on Windows (XP), with v4.2.

Have two toplevel frames visible -- either hit C-n or (as I did) start composing a bug report.
Now, in a/the drscheme window, open the "install .plt file" dialog.  At this point both frames
are visible in the task bar, but Alt+tab "doesn't see" the other frame.  When using the task
bar to switch to this other frame, it doesn't react to input, as if the dialog blocks it too.
I see this happenning on Linux too, so perhaps this is a problem in how the dialog pops up,
but the strange thing is how that other frame "disappears" on Windows.
