 FWIW, I just checked, and the http version of the url fails, but the
 https one works.

 Unless I'm confused, both HTTP and HTTPS fail for me.
 
 Starting from download.racket-lang.org works, though. Probably line 81
 of "racket-lang-org/download/download-pages.rkt" should use
 `at-download` instead of a relative URL.

 Ah, yes, I got that wrong. The link from the HTTPS
 download.racket-lang.org works, but the direct URL doesn't work.

 Sounds good, I'll push the fix.
