>Description:
Open two tabs in DrRacket with different files. I used two new files
with large letters "hello" and "hello 2".

Click show program contour (on "hello"). For me, this shows a blank 
contour window on a fresh DrRacket.

Now if you switch tabs, the contour window will refresh with the correct
content ("hello 2"). Hide the contour view again.

Switch tabs and open contour view again. On my machine, DrRacket shows
"hello 2" from the other tab until I switch tabs again.

 I'm not able to make the first bad behavior happen, and I worry that
 the fix I'm about to push doesn't fix it. Do you might trying again in
 a few minutes?
