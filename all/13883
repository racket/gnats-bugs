>Description:
When I'm viewing the HTML documentation on the file system, and I increase the font size, the font size increase only applies to the current page, when I go to another page the font size goes back to the default. Very strange behavior, as on every other webpage I've ever gone to the font size change applies to the whole website, not just one page. I'm viewing it with Firefox 21.0.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to Help|Racket Documentation. Click on a link to open a page. Increase font size via browser (I'm using Firefox 21.0). Click on link to got to other page. New page is back to original font size.

 I recently ran into the same problem with a different set of pages
 (since I usually look at the racket docs on-line): the problem is that
 the browser remembers your zoom settings based on the server -- and
 for file:// URLs there is no server so it remembers the setting for
 every file.  I had this with Chrome, but my guess is that FF is doing
 the same thing.  I don't think that there is any way to change that.
