>Description:
According to the docs, the following is syntactically legal: 

#lang racket
(define c/c (class/c (m (->m any/c #:show any/c any))))

But CS signals an error: 

this10: unbound identifier; also, no #%top syntax transformer is bound in: this10

Running it gives the same error (with a line break).
