 You have chosen to work in a limited language, similar to but truly  
 distinct from Scheme. Are you aware of this?

 Dear Matthias,
 
 Thank you for your comment.
 
 When I chose the up-most choise, I was able to use the list related 
 functions such as last.  I actually did not aware the up-most choice 
 because I used to use one of the "Teaching Languages" modes and was able 
 to use the list related functions before this version.
 
 Anyway, thanks again for your help.

 I am pretty sure that we did not remove last from Advanced (or any other =
 teaching language). In any case, I will close the bug report.=20
