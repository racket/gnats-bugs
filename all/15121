>Description:
I'm writing a GUI app and need to get a color from the user. For this I want to use the color picker procedure get-color-from-user. However, when the procedure is called, the dialog fails to open and Racket provides the following error:

send: target is not an object
  target: #f
  method name: red
  context...:
   /Applications/Racket v6.2/collects/racket/private/class-internal.rkt:4472:0: obj-error34

   /Applications/Racket v6.2/share/pkgs/gui-lib/mred/private/wx/common/queue.rkt:653:3

The error message was informative enough that I was able to fix the issue.
The offending file is /Applications/Racket v6.2/share/pkgs/gui-lib/mred/private/moredialogs.rkt.

The problem appears lie in the case-lambda case (message parent in-color style) on line 299. It looks like in-color is set to #f when get-color-from-user is called with no arguments.

To fix this, I added
(set! in-color (if (not (is-a? in-color wx:color%)) (make-object wx:color% 100 100 100 1.0) in-color))
after line 303. I'm pretty new to Racket, so this solution is probably inappropriate, but at least I can use the color-picker now!
>How-To-Repeat:
Call the procedure (get-color-from-user) with no arguments on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.

 I was thinking more about a better way to fix this issue. The issue can be
 fixed simply by changing the 3 cases on lines 295-297 to something like the
 following:
 
 [() (get-color-from-user #f (make-object wx:color% 100 100 100 1.0) #f
 null)]
 [(message) (get-color-from-user message #f (make-object wx:color% 100 100
 100 1.0) null)]
 [(message parent) (get-color-from-user message parent (make-object
 wx:color% 100 100 100 1.0) null)]
 
 (hopefully I sent this email to the correct place -- sorry to be a bother)
