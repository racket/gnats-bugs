>Description:
There is a bug in the implementation of CASE in Pretty Big: it doesn't
recognize the "else" clause.
>How-To-Repeat:
As the simplest example, the program in
the documentation

(define (classify c)
    (case (char-general-category c)
     [(ll lu lt ln lo) "letter"]
     [(nd nl no) "number"]
     [else "other"]))

when entered produces the error

case: bad syntax (not a datum sequence) in: else

Note that this is not a problem in the MzScheme language level.

 When I run that program, I get no error.

 You are right.  It appears I did not properly isolate the program.  I
 did now.  There was a require line and adding it shows the problem,
 removing it eliminates the problem:
 
 (require scheme/private/more-scheme)
 
 [The original problem showed up in code from Dorai.]
