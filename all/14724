>Description:
When this (incorrect) program is executed inside DrRacket:

;--
#lang racket
(abort-current-continuation (default-continuation-prompt-tag))
;--

It produces the following error:

call-with-continuation-prompt: result arity mismatch;
 expected number of values not received
  expected: 1
  received: 0
  from: application of default prompt handler
  values...:

C:\Program Files\Racket\share\pkgs\drracket\drracket\private\module-language.rkt: 470:8

The problem is that the source location is pointing to a private file of DrRacket. The error should point to the user's file.
