>Description:
On page 115 of the draft How To Design Class Hierarchies, it states that ProfessorJ provides the class Canvas, which provides methods for drawing shapes.  I have never tried to use it before, and have noticed that the newest version of DrScheme no longer contains ProfessorJ.  When I tried to add a teachpack, I was informed that "Teachpacks are only available in these languages ...", and the list did not include ProfessorJ.  How can I access the Canvas, and later the World, if at all?
>How-To-Repeat:
