 I looked into this a bit more.  Other people have been seeing it and
 attribute it to something in the PSMTabBarControl.framework.  For
 example, the macvim folks see it here:
 
     http://code.google.com/p/macvim/issues/detail?id=421
 
 and they updated their version of this framework to avoid the error message.

 Thanks!
 
 I've built a version that I think will fix the problem, but some
 versions of referenced frameworks changed, and so I need to
 double-check them on an older machine when I get back to Utah.
 
 Meanwhile, I'll send you the replacement to try.
