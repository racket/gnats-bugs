>Description:
I started with a fresh clone of the PLT sources in the directory $PLTHOME and with the following environment variables set:

PLTPLANETDIR=$PLTHOME/add-on/planet
PLTADDONDIR=$PLTHOME/add-on
PLTCOMPILEDROOTS=$PLTHOME/zos/v@(version):

Starting in $PLTHOME, I ran:

cd src
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install
$PLTHOME/bin/raco setup

Even after having finished "make install", running "raco setup" re-runs all the .scrbl files in the collections.

  | raco setup: fix doc dependency check for PLTCOMPILEDROOTS
  | 
  | A doc build depends on its source's ".zo" file, which might
  | not be next to the source due to a PLTCOMPILEDROOTS setting.

  | Closes PR 13640
