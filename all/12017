>Description:
The following program constructs a struct and exports it using units. Looking at the resulting struct-info we can see that the length of the mutators and accessors is not the same. This is supposed to be a requirement of struct infos.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require (for-syntax racket/struct-info))

(define-signature sig2^
  ((struct my-error (v))))


(define-unit a-unit@
  (import)
  (export sig2^)
  (define-struct my-error (v)))

(define-values/invoke-unit/infer a-unit@)

(begin-for-syntax 
  struct-info?
  (displayln (extract-struct-info (syntax-local-value #'my-error))))

;produces
;(#<syntax struct:my-error> #<syntax my-error1> #<syntax my-error?> (#<syntax my-error-v> #f) (#f) #f)
