>Description:
It looks like mac radio boxes don't behave right when selection is set to #f.  Run the code below to see. I'd be astonished if this
was the expected behavior
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this program:

#lang racket

(require mred)

(define f (new frame% [label "abc"]))

[define debugging-left 
  (new radio-box%
       (label #f)
       (choices 
        (list "aosetuhasnotehusatoheu snato"
              "ohohoehtunhonthenothnohuno"))
       (parent f))]

(send f show #t)

(send debugging-left set-selection #f)
;; should be false:
(send debugging-left get-selection)
;; should still be false, is instead 0:
(send debugging-left get-selection)

 John: Although I closed the PR, I'd like to double-check one thing. Do
 you have global keyboard navigation enabled (so that there can be a
 focus ring around a radio button)?
