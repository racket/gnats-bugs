(define-type X (List (U (Instance D) (Instance C))))
(define-type C (Class (a (-> X))))
(define-type (D x) (Class #:implements C (b (-> x))))

  | Allow `send` to union of objects
  | 
  | Also fix TR `send` for multiple/any values as receiver
  | 
  | Now emits a real type error instead of crashing with
  | an internal match error.
  | 
  | Closes PR 14547
