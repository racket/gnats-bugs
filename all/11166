>Description:
When stepping through a program in BSL, the stepper shows current progress, e.g., 
0/3, 1/3, 2/3
But since the step numbers start at 0, the progress only goes to (n-1)/n, and not n/n when the user has stepped through the entire program.
I didn't notice this situation, but my students did during class, which became their first lesson in 0-based indexing (for better or worse).
Thanks! Marc

 That was a deliberate choice, though I could be convinced that it was =
 the wrong one; I think I was trying to mirror the behavior of the =
 current "search" command.
 
 Any other opinions?

 The search command got changed a little while ago, I think. :)
 
 But I think you should got from 1/n to n/n. (The text search is a
 little more complex because you can be before or after the first /
 last hit.)
