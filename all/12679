 It seems like this is something that random testing (from the untyped
 side, using contracts as the test oracle) would have come up with
 pretty easily. Have you guys considered writing a grammar of the
 arithmetic ops and letting Redex loose to see if it finds anything?
 (You probably want to "tune" the grammar to make it more likely to
 pick out interesting things. The grammar in the 2htdp/image tests is
 one example where I tried to do this.)

 We thought about something similar to check optimization correctness,
 but not for types. That's a good idea. I'll look into it.
 
 Thanks!
