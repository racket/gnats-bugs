 Thank you for the report!
 
 I haven't been able to replicate the crash so far, but I also don't
 have a directory with "HolographicFirstRun" in its name. My guess is
 that the problem is related to a property of specific paths in your
 directory, perhaps something related to reparse points. Just scanning
 all directories in "AppData" on my machine didn't turn up anything,
 either, unfortunately.
 
 I'll keep investigating as I can, but let me know if you have any more
 information about the problem or notice any other specific symptoms.
