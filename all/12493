>Description:
When I start in "determine language from source mode"
and change to "Beginning Student", the available tool
buttons change correctly. When I switch back to
"determine language from source mode", only the "Run"
and "Stop" button are left.

Changing the `#lang' line and reverting the change causes
the missing tool buttons to appear.
