18.2 Modules and Performance

The module system aids optimization by helping to ensure that identifiers have the usual bindings. That is, the + provided by racket/base can be recognized by the compiler and inlined, which is especially important for JIT-compiled code. In contrast, in a traditional interactive Racket system, the top-level + binding might be redefined, so the compiler cannot assume a fixed + binding (unless special flags or declarations act as a poor-man’s module system to indicate otherwise).

 Or maybe just drop that sentence (or make it say "r5" and drop the
 'poor-man's' comment or elaborate to make it more precise perhaps via
 a pointer to the you-want-it-when paper)?
