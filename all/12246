>Description:
libjpeg-7.dll apparently requires the Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable installed in order to work properly.  This dll is required by DrRacket, but the redistributable is not installed by the Racket installer.  Attempting to run DrRacket without the Redistributable causes a fairly cryptic error stating that the "side-by-side configuration" of libjpeg-7.dll "is incorrect".  As is common with Windows, I had 5 different versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable installed, but not the one it needed.  As I am running Windows 7 64-bit the version needed was: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=2092
I assume that if I was running 32-bit Windows, then the version needed would be: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5582
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Install DrRacket on a system without the needed libraries (a clean/brand new install of Windows 7 x64 for me)
2. Attempt to run DrRacket.
