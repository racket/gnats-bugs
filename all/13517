 Note: the issue is the rendering of the quote character.
 
 It also differs depending on HTML or PDF output. Compare chapter 2.4 of:
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/guide/Pairs__Lists__and_Racket_Syntax.html
   and
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/pdf/guide.pdf
 
 for the quoted snippet above.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
