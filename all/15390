Using Dr Racket 6.7 on Win 10.

In the Choose Language dialog, turn off "Show sharing in values" and choose Quasiquote output. 

Place in definition window and run:
#lang racket
(define p (shared ((-0- (list -0-))) -0-))
(define q (shared ((-0- (list (box -0-)))) -0-))

In interaction window you can (display ...) and (write ...) both p and q, but (print ...) only works on p. (print q) goes into a loop.

 Thanks. I've pushed a fix.
 
 AFAICT, this bug is very old, probably dating to the mid to late 90s.
 (Git dates it to 2001, but I think that's wrong; I think it is showing
 a file that got renamed and the history somehow gets lost before that
 (at least to me).)

 Yeah, the git history following didn't catch the changes involved
 there. The place to start looking further-back is here:
 https://github.com/samth/old-plt/commit/f5580a5774b308d17aad65ddf4b6f105eb0c6bcd
 
 However, looking at that, the implementation seems pretty different
 before that commit (see
 https://github.com/samth/old-plt/commit/f5580a5774b308d17aad65ddf4b6f105eb0c6bcd#diff-c05eabfad78c56a0fb6cff56a9fcb33f)
 and therefore the specific form of this bug seems to have been
 introduced by Matthew in 2001.
 
 [How did I find that? First, I went to the commit before Robby's
 change, looked at the blame information, and it pointed to this
 commit: https://github.com/racket/pconvert-lib/commit/e6a6374cc73f6647f7b23f5baa89ad8088743b46.
 That commit says "original commit:
 f5580a5774b308d17aad65ddf4b6f105eb0c6bcd". That SHA is for the
 conversion to Git in this repository:
 https://github.com/samth/old-plt/ and that's where the commit is
 found.]

 As far as I can tell, the commit where you claim Matthew implemented
 pconvert claims entirely of it being deleted. So.... I don't agree.
 Also, my memory of implementing pconvert disagrees. :)

 This line has (the main piece) of the bug:
 
 https://github.com/samth/old-plt/commit/780c8abd1defdce429de#diff-c05eabfad78c56a0fb6cff56a9fcb33fR317
 
 and that commit shows Matthew introducing a big pile of code in 1997.
 But I also think that that's not the final say since, as I may have
 mentioned, I don't think he wrote that library. :)

 Also, poking around in the parent of that commit:
 
   https://github.com/samth/old-plt/tree/ea43f6b43d209a53804ae3494aa075d15e2a90a3
 
 has a version of drracket that refers to pconvert, but no pconvert
 that I can see.
 
 Ah well, it was a long time ago!  :)

 Ah, I now see where I mis-read the commit I linked to. I also see that
 the name Gann Bierner is attached to some of the pconvert code, so
 maybe they can be blamed for this bug. ;)
