 I believe the problem is that the file that the file:
 
    /Applications/Racket v6.3/doc/search/index.html
 
 is in Apple's quarantine. It may work to run this from the command line:
 
    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Racket
 v6.3/doc/search/index.html"
 
 Please let us know if that works!

 FWIW, this looks like the same problem as PR 15205.
