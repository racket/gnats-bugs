 Is this one of those places where check syntax should be more careful
 somehow, or is this one of those places where the checks are too
 restrictive?
 
 Thanks,

 OK this just escalated from non-critical to critical bc. I've gotten it twice more and now I must kill -9 DrRacket as it becomes frozen (no cpu usage).

 Are you editing a very long file? If so, I guess that breaking it up
 will make the problem go away.

 I've pushed a fix based on the stack trace in the error. I'm not sure
 things won't go wrong elsewhere, but at least that specific error
 shouldn't be raised anymore. Please let me know if that helps.
 
 (I'm not at all sure that that is the right fix; I'd expect that that
 restriction shouldn't be there instead.)
