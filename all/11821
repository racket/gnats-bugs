>Description:
On Ubuntu 10.04 64bit DrRacket crashes to the desktop when custom data is requested from the clipboard as in the snip below. (Perhaps I'm using the clipboard the wrong way, but still it shouldn't crash.)
>How-To-Repeat:
; uncomment last line to experience the crash 
#lang racket/gui
(define clipboard-type "TST?")

(define my-clipboard-client%
  (class* clipboard-client% ()
    (init-field data)

    (define/override (get-data format)
      (if (equal? format clipboard-type)
          data
          #f))
    
    (super-new)
    (send this add-type clipboard-type)))

(define my-clipboard-client #f)

(define (clipboard-add-custom-data data timestamp)
  (set! my-clipboard-client (new my-clipboard-client% (data data)))
  (send the-clipboard set-clipboard-client my-clipboard-client timestamp))

(define (clipboard-get-custom-data timestamp)
  (send the-clipboard get-clipboard-data clipboard-type timestamp))

(define (clipboard-has-custom-data?)
  (send the-clipboard same-clipboard-client? my-clipboard-client))

(clipboard-add-custom-data "hello world" (current-milliseconds))
(send my-clipboard-client get-data "TST?") ; ==> "hello world"
;(clipboard-get-custom-data (current-milliseconds)) ; ==> crash to desktop
