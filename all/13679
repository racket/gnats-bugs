>Description:
Running "racket narrow.rkt" produces "#<foo>", as expected. Then running "raco make narrow.rkt" seems to succeed, and produces output in "compiled/", but running "racket narrow.rkt" after the raco-make step causes the following error:

Wed Apr 10 13:12:07 tonyg@stockholm

#<foo>

  | fix hole in validator
  | 
  | The validator was not as smart as the compiler in determining
  | that a `let' expression could be relied on to produce a
  | constant-shaped function (without side effect or error) in the case
  | that a right-hand side expression is a call to a known structure
  | constructor or predicate.

  | Closes PR 13679

  | Merge to v5.3.4
