Linux 3.13.6-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Mar 7 22:47:48 CET 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux
>Description:
On HEAD of the current release or master, syncing on an alarm-evt scheduled more than 2^31 milliseconds in the future saturates the CPU on an x86-64 Linux system. This occurs in particular when the web server serves a large file as it increases the connection timeout by one second per byte. The problem is not present on a different x86-64 OS X system. Interestingly, the bad behavior is only manifest as long as the alarm is scheduled more than 2^31ms out. Once the alarm drops below 2^31ms out, the CPU usage drops immediately.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following at the REPL pegs the processor for five seconds:

(sync/enable-break (alarm-evt (+ (current-inexact-milliseconds) (expt 2 31) 5000)))
