>Description:
not a fatal one, but quite confusing for a newbie like me. after searching google and stackoverflow, no particular document addressed this issue; on your website you simply said select this 
"use the language declared in source", which doesn't exist for me in win 8.1 64 bit. I have only select Racket, select teaching, and other languages.

Could you please update the GUI accordingly ?

now I have to change by hand typing in 

#!r6rs
(import (rnrs (6)))

then hit run to get my language updated to r6rs.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. open up DrRacket.
2. select language on menu bar.
3. select choose language option.

expect: see the option of use the language declared in source
actual: only saw option of select the racket language.
