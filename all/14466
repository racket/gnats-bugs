>Description:
In Redex judgment-forms, Racket will complain when you try to use the underscore in patterns at different ellipsis depths. It says that it's the "same binder", but underscore shouldn't be treated as a binder - it should be treated as a pattern that matches anything, regardless of other uses of underscore in the pattern.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang racket

(require redex/reduction-semantics)

(define-language L)

(define-judgment-form L
  #:mode (J I)
  #:contract (J any)
  [(where (_ _ ...) any)
   -----------------------------
   (J any)])

(test-equal (judgment-holds (J ())) #f)
(test-equal (judgment-holds (J (a b))) #t)
