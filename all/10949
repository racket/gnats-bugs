>Description:
When you try to run the Stepper on a Beginning Student file that includes reference to "big-bang" or "animate", it doesn't work; in the former case giving a message "annotate/inner: this region of code is still under construction"; in the latter case, just not displaying anything at all in the Stepper window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following program in a "Beginning Student"-level file and press the "Step" button.


(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define (drawit x)
  (circle x "solid" "blue"))

(define (runit x)
;  (animate drawit))
  (big-bang x (on-draw drawit)))

 I'll take temporary responsibility. This has been on my map for a while.
