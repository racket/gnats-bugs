>Description:
I wasn't able to find a way to do a "not equal" in any fashion in datalog. I understand that datalog is a subset of prolog. Either I'm missing something or the capability doesn't exist.

In prolog, =\= works as "not equal" test.
>How-To-Repeat:
%Basically I need something to give me permutations of symbols:

sym(a).
sym(b).
sym(c).
perm(X,Y) :- sym(X), sym(Y), X != Y.   % here's where I'd need a "not equal"

perm(X,Y)?
