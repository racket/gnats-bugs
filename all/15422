>Description:
I have just installed Dr Racket for the UBC How to Code: Simple Data Course on the edx website. My Kaspersky antivirus did not find any problems with the file itself, but it has classified Dr racket as 'low restricted' rather than 'trusted' because the digital signature from PLT Design Inc is missing. It was the same for version 6.8

I guess it could be that Kaspersky is wrong and if so, please accept my apologies. Either way, I would appreciate it if you could let me know what is happening on this. I have tried checking the documentation and the bug reports but could not find anything

Many thanks

Magda
