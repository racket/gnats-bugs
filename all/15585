>Description:
DrRacket is used in education, for example in Tübingen, Germany. In the 2018 lecture https://timms.uni-tuebingen.de/tp/UT_20181106_002_info1c_0001 at 09:40, the button "Syntaxprüfungen" is called "stupidly named", and rightfully so.

That button does not check the syntax of the program, as the name might suggest. Instead it demonstrates the lexical binding rule.

To prevent future students from being confused by this stupid naming, the button should be named so that the name represents its function.

To prevent confusion in other languages than German, all the other translations of DrRacket should be checked as well that they don't contain the word "syntax" at this place.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket.
Look at the buttons in the toolbar.
>Fix:
