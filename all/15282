I can't get scrollbar

I need a scrollbar and a read-only text field 

like a simple irc client, one text field to display message, but
the text field should not be typed in and it should have a scrollbar
to view the old message

 Instead of disabling the text field, you can make its content
 read-only by using `get-editor` and `lock`:
 
  (send print1 set-value text-to-show-users)
  (send (send print1 get-editor) lock #t)
 
 If you need more fine-grained control, you may find it easier to work
 with an `editor-canvas%` and `text%` instead of a `text-field%`.
