>Description:
"raco pkg install" sometimes asks you yes/no questions, e.g.
Would you like to install them via your package indices? [Yn]
When I run raco from a cmd.exe window in Windows 7, I type the letter "Y", and it says 
Invalid input: "Y\r"
I presume it's using some kind of Unix console-input routine that doesn't know what to do with Windows line terminators.
