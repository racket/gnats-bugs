>Description:
If raco test runs on more than one file and all the tests in each file succeed, the "N tests passed" result will give the number of files that passed, instead of the full number of tests within those files. This is misleading.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Write the following program twice: once as a.rkt, again as b.rkt

#lang racket

(module+ test
  (require rackunit)
  (check-equal? #t #t)
  (check-equal? #t #t)
  (check-equal? #t #t))

2. At the command line, run "raco test a.rkt b.rkt".
3. Raco reports 2 tests passed, even though a total of 6 tests passed.

 On further examination, this is a more general issue, and possibly just a
 conceptual mistake on my part. The message from raco test is based on
 test-log in rackunit/log, which reports each check as its own "test". I
 would expect a single test case with multiple checks to be considered a
 single test for reporting purposes, but perhaps that's not the intent.
 
 Can anyone confirm the definition of "test" here?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Sat, 04 Apr 2015 12:35:28 -0400
Reason>>> This isn't really an error in my opinion.

The test case counting uses mutation inside of the Racket program.

By default, when "raco test" encounters multiple files, then it runs them in separate processes (to facilitate parallelism, timeouts, etc.) If you override 
this with "--direct", then you'll get the behavior you expect.

% raco test --direct -- /tmp/a.rkt /tmp/b.rkt
raco test: (submod "/tmp/a.rkt" test)
raco test: (submod "/tmp/b.rkt" test)
6 tests passed
~plt/extra-pkgs
% raco test --direct -j 2 -- /tmp/a.rkt /tmp/b.rkt
raco test: 0 (submod "/tmp/a.rkt" test)
raco test: 0 (submod "/tmp/b.rkt" test)
6 tests passed
~plt/extra-pkgs
% raco test -j 2 -- /tmp/a.rkt /tmp/b.rkt
raco test: 0 (submod "/tmp/a.rkt" test)
raco test: 1 (submod "/tmp/b.rkt" test)
2 tests passed

 Why is "2" ever a meaningful output here? I think I'm missing something.

 Each process is a test when process mode is used

 That doesn't seem very useful or intuitive. Surely we can do better?

 Probably, but I think it would involve complicated or expensive IPC
 for little benefit. A big problem is that this test counting is a hack
 and was never part of rackunit or the other testing libraries.

 I'll try to take a look into this at some point.
 
 Not having looked yet, I do like what you've done so far, Jay: it
 seems just right and should be made to work for the -j n>1 case.
