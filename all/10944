>Description:
Hi,
in v4.90.0.1, Ubuntu 10.04:

My scribble file:
/media/Divers/Projets/Scheme-svn/towers/docs/manual.scrbl
contains (roughly):
<<<
#lang scribble/manual

@title{Image Test}

@(image "../img/set1/tower-one.png")
>>>

The image is supposed to be in:
/media/Divers/Projets/Scheme-svn/towers/img/set1/tower-one.png

This will not render with the 'Scribble HTML' button, and fails with the following error:
<<<
copy-file: source file does not exist; cannot copy: /home/laurent/../img/monuments/tower-one.png to: /media/Divers/Projets/Scheme-svn/towers/docs/tower-one.png

>>>

The head of the message is strange since the copy seems to be backwards.

The html file is not generated.

Best regards,
Laurent

 I'll change the HTML button to set the current directory while
 rendering a Scribble document.
 
 You could also use the `racket/runtime-path' library to avoid making
 the document depend on the directory where it is run.
