>Description:
This is going to be a bit long, hopefully it will be helpful.  It starts
with a story about playing sounds, then gets to a DrR problem of slow
file dialogs.

I got a new laptop, running Windows 8.1.  When I tried to run my student
roulette, it behaved in a very weird way.  I minimized it to the code
below, which uses no other gui things.  (Use with any wave files, very
short for Click and longer for the other.)  The `read-line' is intended
to delay exit to let the sound play (avoided yielding to make things
simple).  The strange behavior happened no matter how I tried it: using
`play-sound', using the code that implements in minimized to avoid the
semaphore and atomic and whatever, using playSoundA() instead of ...W,
or using mciSendStringA() with various combination of aliases, opens,
closes, and other mci API things.

Here's what it did: each play would take the expected quickish time
(eyeballed with printfs), but the sound would not play until a while
later, somehwere between a second and sometimes up to ~5 seconds.  The
"Click" sound is short enough that it would never hear since (I think)
it would play them all together.  Now, every once in a while I'd switch
back to Emacs while it's running and hit C-g to get the Windows ding
sound, and *while* that played, I'd hear a quick burst of the Click
sounds -- so for some reason this made them "flush" in a way that did
have some spaces between them.  The whole thing seemed very weird to the
point that I was convinced that the laptop is defective.

Then I tried to do some debugging in DrR -- and something very annoying
is that each file-open dialog would take a very long time.  Something on
the order of 5 to 20 seconds (enough for me to switch to doing something
else while waiting).  Remembering some DrR problems with network drives,
I disconnected the two drives I had mapped.  After that the file dialog
appeared immediately, as expected.  I then:

  * Reconnected first network drive, dialog works fine
  * Restart DrR, still works fine
  * Reconnected second, works fine
  * Restart, still fine.

And here is where it gets interesting: I went back to try the sound
playing thing -- and now that's running fine too.  Went back to the gui
thing, and that works fine too.

So it seems that something is wrong on some deeper level.
Unfortunately, I think that it's not stable enough to reproduce.  In any
case, I will try rebooting now.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(let loop ([s 1])
  (play-sound "Click.wav" #t)
  (sleep (/ s 1000.0))
  (unless (> s 250) (loop (+ s (random (+ 4 (round (/ s 2))))))))
(play-sound "RimShot.wav" #t)
(void (read-line))
