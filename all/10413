>Description:
After I installed pltscheme on my fedora10 system, I tried the first thing recommended here:
 http://docs.plt-scheme.org/quick/
namely:

 #lang slideshow
 Then click the Run button.

All I got was
  Language: Advanced Student custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
  module: name is not defined, not a parameter, and not a primitive name

I get a different sort of error (collection not fount) with '#lang foo', from which I infer that '#lang slideshow' is finding a collection, which contains a bug. But there is no information provided about which file has the bug, which line, etc.

I tried various student level settings, from beginner to advanced (I already know quite a bit about lisp-like languages -- I maintain the poplog site (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html) and was trying to compare the drscheme teaching facilities with those using Pop-11 in poplog.

You have managed to defeat me completely despite my 38 years of programming!

 At the beginning of the "Quick" guide there is this paragraph:
 
   If you=E2=80=99ve used DrScheme before, you might need to manually re=
 set the
   language to Module via the Language|Choose Language... menu item
   before clicking Run.
 
 Switching the language to the language to the `Module' language will
 resolve your problem.
 
 The student languages are different in that you shouldn't use a
 `#lang' line when you're using them; if your goal is to inspect the
 teaching facilities, then it might be better to go with the teaching
 materials (htdp, or htdw).
 
 Finally, the error message is bad -- if we add a parameter that
 forbids `#lang' then it will resolve this kind of problem too.

 Such a parameter already exists - `read-accept-reader?'.

 No, I'm referring to the plan to add a `read-accept-lang' parameter
 that will be disabled when reading a module body, making a much better
 error message for the teaching languages and other.  It should also be
 disabled on the repl, making the other aspect of this bug (enter
 `#lang' on the repl, and conclude that mzscheme is stuck in some
 infinite loop) go away.
 
 In both of these situations, `#reader' should still be valid.

 Eli,
 
 Thanks very much for your very rapid and helpful response.

 I had not used DrScheme before, so I did not see that as relevant to
 me!
 
 There's an ambiguity in 'before'. It could mean (and I took it to
 mean) 'on some other occasion'. I now realise it was asking whether
 I had performed any previous action using Dr Scheme before going
 to the quick guide.
 
 (Maybe this is a difference between use of adverbs in British and
 American English?)
 
 Also it now turns out that the instruction that gets displayed on
 start-up is wrong:
 
      DrScheme cannot process programs until you choose a programming
      language.
 
 It is wrong because you can, it seems, give the command
 
      #lang slideshow
 
 without explicitly choosing a language!
 
 Maybe that initial message should be removed and replaced with
 something like:
 
      If you have not tried Dr. Scheme before, you should follow the
      instructions in the quick guide (...ref....) *before* trying
      anything else.
 
 When I started up Dr Scheme, I saw the instruction to choose a
 language on the panel, so I clicked the 'language button' and saw
 the menu.
 
 For some reason I did not take 'Module' as one of the options. It
 looked like some sort of header, and it seemed that the
 only languages available had to be one of
 
      Teaching languages
      Legacy languages
      Experimental languages
 
 So I tried the options listed under those headers, and none of them
 would make the slideshow example work.
 
 It may be useful to have, above 'Module' another blue heading
 something like:
 
      Default 'language' for demos:
 
          Module
 
 I suggest that since you are providing a quick introduction to
 newcomers you should include on the web page, under '2 Set',
 something like this:
 
      The following instruction will work if you have not yet
      attempted to run anything or selected a language.
 
      If you have tried anything, including selecting a language,
      other than 'Module', then you should select the language button
      then 'choose language'.
 
      A 'Choose Language' menu will pop up.
      Click on 'Module' at the top, then 'OK', to
      return to the main DrScheme panel.
      'Module' will now be visible in the bottom left corner.
 
      Now do the following:
 
 (Text starting 'To draw pictures,...')
 
 (One of my colleagues has a slogan: 'Anything that can be
 misunderstood probably will be.).

 Maybe the quick guide should include an explicit warning not to try
 the teaching languages before following the guide.
 
 (I have now found htdp, but not htdw. Did you mean
      Web Applications in PLT Scheme
 ?)

 I guess what sort of error message is provided should depend on the
 level of the user. We have three default settings in Pop-11
 (for beginners, experts, and system developers), and the error
 handler can also be changed according to context.
 
 Thanks again.
