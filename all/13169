>Description:
The difference between <http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Source_Locations.html#(form._((lib._syntax%2Flocation..rkt)._quote-module-name))> and <http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Source_Locations.html#(form._((lib._syntax%2Flocation..rkt)._quote-module-path))> is not terribly clear from the documentation.  About all I can gather from the examples shown is that the latter adds an additional `quote' to the result when it is in a symbolic form.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Thu, 29 Nov 2012 12:00:59 -0500
Reason>>> I wrote the original form of these macros.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Thu, 29 Nov 2012 12:00:59 -0500
Reason>>> I just need to clarify the purpose of these two macros in
the documentation.
