>Description:
Windows when open up does not bring up to the front. I have to click on bring frame to the front to get the windows to display. I ussually just cancel out of that when windows show up. Once they show up, the red button to close out of windows doesn't close the windows and quit dr racket won't close all the windows and quit. It normally just hang and have to kill process manually. After running the program twice, it use up a tremedous amount of memory and slow down significantly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrRacket in Mac OS X Lion. Current version 10.7.1. Run a 300 lines program for more than 2 times.
