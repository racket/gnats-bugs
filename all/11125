>Description:
Firefox 3.6 appears to maintain a persistent connection to the web-server after receiving an HTTP response. 

In contrast, Internet Explorer 7 does not, and implements the expected connectionless behavior.

This can cause inconsistent and unexpected behavior in thread-cells and web-cells. (please see example below)

The Firefox browser will close the connection if HTTP Header "Connection: close" is included in the response

However, this relies on browser behavior to work. 

It would be preferable to force the server to close the connection, when desired.

If possible, could we please add a keyword argument to serve/servlet 

       #:close-connection boolean?

so that #:close-connection #t would close the connection with the browser after sending a response?

Thanks very much.

>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

;REQUIRES FIREFOX 3.6 to see bug.

;Run, then hit refresh button on browser to see difference in behavior

;CASE I

;With HTTP HEADER "Connection: close" in response, Firefox closes connection after receiving response.

;Next response will use new thread, *foo* will always have initial value of #f, then toggle to #t.

;CASE II

;Without HTTP header "Connection: close" in response, thread stays alive.

;*foo* will togggle between #t and #f.


(require web-server/servlet 
         xml 
         web-server/servlet-env )

(define *foo* (make-thread-cell #f))

(define (start request)
  ;toggle foo
  (thread-cell-set! *foo* (not (thread-cell-ref *foo*)))
  (make-response/full
   200 #"Okay"

  (list 
   ;START- COMMENT ME OUT TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR
 ; (make-header #"Connection" #"close")
  ;END- COMMMENT ME OUT TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR
   (make-header #"Cache-control" #"no-store"))
   (list (string->bytes/locale 
          (xexpr->string `(html (head 
                                (body (h1 
                                       ,(format "foo is ~A"
                                                (thread-cell-ref  *foo*)))))))))))

(require web-server/servlet-env) 
(serve/servlet start 
                 #:launch-browser? #t
                 #:quit? #f
