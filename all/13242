 It appears that you have a system where drracket can locate aspell,
 but when it runs it, it just gets eof on stdout.
 
 Can you help me figure out what is going on?
 
 If you do this?
 
 #lang racket
 (require framework/private/aspell)
 (find-aspell-binary-path)
 
 
 what answer do you get?
 Thanks,
 Robby

 What happens if you just type /usr/bin/aspell at the commandline? Do
 you get any output?

 From what I can tell from the stacktrace, that error occurs when the
 aspell program exits without printing something. I can just avoid
 problems in this case by being more careful, but wanted to know what
 actually happens when you run aspell on your machine. Something is
 fishy.

 Oh, whoops, sorry. I should have said: can you call it like this:
 
   aspell -a --encoding=utf-8
 
 ?

 Ah, there is the problem:
 Erreur : No word lists can be found for the language "fr_FR".
 
 It seems that it's looking for my French dictionary (from my locale I
 suppose), but I only have the English dictionaries.
 Installing aspell-fr (sudo apt-get install aspell-fr) gives a normal output
 (waiting for input), and DrRacket works fine then.
 
 However, I want the spell checker to use both fr and en dictionaries, is
 this possible? (should I open a new thread on the mailing list for that?)
 
 Thanks,
 Laurent

 I don't know how to do that. If you can coax aspell into doing that
 (hopefully by using configuration files ~/.aspell ...?) then you
 should be all set.
 
 Meanwhile, I'll see if I can make DrRacket more robust.

 Using multiple dictionaries at the same time looks complicated with aspell:
 http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/aspell-user/2011-07/msg00008.html
 
 However, I guess it would be much easier to simply switch between languages.
 "aspell dicts" gives the list of available dictionaries, and "aspell
 -d<dict>" allows to select one.
 Maybe it would be possible to list all the available dictionaries in an
 Spell Check submenu, and let the user check the one that is wanted (per
 document would be awesome but it's certainly more complicated).
 
 I would be willing to give it a shot myself and modify DrRacket, but I'm
 pretty sure I wouldn't do it correctly (mainly because of subprocesses that
 need special care to handle)...

 Thank you very much!
 Scribbling in DrRacket has just got an important upgrade!
 (I'll test when it's in the next nightly)

 Does framework/private/aspell.rkt have a get-aspell-dicts function? If
 so, then that means that you got the new code and something has gone
 wrong somehow.
 
 If you do, can you check what you get if you require that file and evaluate
 
   (get-aspell-dicts)
 
 If it returns #f, then what does
 
    aspell dump dicts
 
 do at the commandline?

 In today's nightly, it works fine! Thank you very much!
 
 I have some small problems with multi-line strings though:
 For example, in the following string the part after the last comma
 (included) is colored in black (and sometimes in red?!) :
 "Returns the list of list of strings for the name,
 the visible name, the icon name and the visible icon name in order."
 
 If I type multi-line string with commas, there are some strange behaviors
 too, like words not being uncolored from the mistake color soon enough, or
 not at all if it's the end of the string.
