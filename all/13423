>Description:
While building everything from scratch on OpenBSD, racket3m reliably coredumps while "raco setup" is building the documentation:

raco setup: running: scribblings/main/acks.scrbl

about to suspend in atomic mode
Abort trap (core dumped) 
*** Error code 134

gdb gives the following backtrace from the core dump:

Otherwise racket and drracket seem to work.

Note that libmpfr is not installed by default on OpenBSD, it has to be installed manually by the sysadmin from OpenBSD's port system.

After intalling libmpfr, "raco setup" works fine.

So it looks like racket doesn't handle the absence of libmpfr gracefully, at least on OpenBSD.

 It generally does, but apparently not on custodian shutdown. Thanks for 
 the report!
 
 Matthew, I think this would fix it, so I'm going to give it a shot:
 
 (define mpfr-shutdown
    (register-custodian-shutdown
     mpfr-free-cache ; acts as a "random" object for a shutdown handle
     (λ (free)
       (when mpfr-lib
         ;; The direct reference here is important, since custodian holds
         ;; only a weak reference to shutdown handle:
         (mpfr-free-cache)))))

 I just pushed what is hopefully a fix for this. Can you reply with the 
 results after you try it? Thanks!

 I uninstalled libmpfr from my computer and tried again, and it works
 fine now.  Thank you :-)
