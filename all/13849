>Description:
All containers are limited to 10000 pixel. This limit is far too low for todays applications - and there is no readon I can think ot that forbids increasing this limit.

I've attached a patch that increases the limit to 1000000 pixel, which is enough for my application but is not justified either - removing that limit at all would be the better way.

The patch is uuencoded, bzipped.

 I agree that the limit can and should be raised, and I hope to take a
 close look in the coming week.
 
 Removing the limit would create many possibilities for internal errors
 and silent failures, since the underlying GUI toolkits work in terms of
 C `int' and `float' types (but no longer `short' types, I think, which
 is where the original limit came from).
 
 Thanks!

  | raise GUI size limit to 1000000
  | 
  | Add `dimension-integer?', `position-integer?',
  | `spacing-integer?', and `positive-dimension-integer?' to make
  | the documentation, especially, more parameterized over the
  | limit.
  | 
  | Also, make the slider limits match the dimension/position limit,
  | since they're often related.
  | 
  | Things go wrong with, for example, a canvas that is
  | larger than 32k in a dimension. It looks like there's
  | a problem on each platform, although not exactly the
  | same problem. Meanwhile, even larger scrollable panels
  | can work ok on platforms other than Windows.
