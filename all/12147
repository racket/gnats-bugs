>Description:
let-values in racket is defined to accept only binding-lists of the form (id ...), but let-values in srfi/11 is defined to accept rest lists. Requiring srfi/11 should let me use rest-lists in let-values and let*-values.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require srfi/11)
;; Should produce (list 1 2 3):
(let-values ((x (values 1 2 3))) x)
