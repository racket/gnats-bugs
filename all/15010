>Description:
I can neither save nor open *.rkt files from my working directory M:\Eduardo\Dropbox\racket\ directory from the DrRacket interface.

___Note the drive letter is "M:", not the "usual" C:___

For some reason, any attempt to access files in M: trigger a "normalize-path" error, and the "element: C:\Eduardo", which is a _non_ existent directory in my computer, is referenced.

>How-To-Repeat:
Any attempt to open files in M:\Eduardo\Dropbox\racket\ from DrRacket results in the error above. I have not been able to open any rkt files in drive M:.

Bizarrely, the files *are* saved to the directory, but the error is still triggered (so, I have *.rkt files in my directory, that DrRacket is *incapable* of opening!). However, when trying to load files, the error is triggered and nothing happens (files aren't loaded).

 It looks like there is also a bug elsewhere, but see what happens if
 you do this series of steps:
 
 1) Choose the File | Open Require Path.... menu item
 2) type "dr/pr/un" into the dialog (without the quote, of course) and
 then hit return.
 3) search for "normalize-path/exists" and replace the two calls to it
 (in the body of the get-tab-label-from-filename) method with
 "simple-form-path".
 4) delete the definition normalize-path/exists (optional)
 
 Restart DrRacket.
 
 Does that help?

 My guess is that M:\Eduardo is a filesystem junction that v6.1.1
 doesn't handle correctly. If so, the problem is likely corrected in the
 current development version.
 
 Does a snapshot build behavior any better?

 Robby=2C
 Yep=2C this has solved the problem. I had to edit the file c:\Program Files=
 \Racket\share\pkgs\drracket\drracket\private\unit.rkt as administrator (out=
 side DrRacket) to be able to save the changes.
 Thanks a lot!

 I did not try the snapshot build=2C but Robby's suggestion (separate reply)=
  has solved the problem for me.
 Regarding your guess=2C M:\Eduardo is definitely not a filesystem junction.=
  I've made the "My Documents" folder point to M:\Eduardo (Windows can be co=
 axed to look for a user's "My Documents" at a different location than C:\Us=
 ers\username\Documents=3B I always do this when I reinstall the OS). I didn=
 't have to make a junction manually=2C though perhaps Windows did behind th=
 e scenes.
 I keep all my files in M:=2C completely separate from the OS on C:. My %HOM=
 E% environment variable also points to M:\Eduardo.
