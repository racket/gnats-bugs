The bug-report system cannot deal with non-ASCII, so
the example is manlged and it's not clear what you
mean to report. And "looks wrong to me" with no
further explanation of why (much less an
attempt to find out what it should be) just isn't
acceptable.

 This bug was premature, it appears things do work properly. Code point
 00bd doesn't get printed as its unicode character when simply typed into
 the repl (on the command line) but if I use printf then I see its
 symbolic representation, the 1/2 symbol.

 "\u00BD"
 -> (printf "~a\n" "\u00bd")
 ½
 
 So doing (string-upcase "½") resulted in "\u00bd" instead of "½" so I
 thought string-upcase was somehow ignoring the utf encoding. But
 strangely some other unicode characters are printed when entered
 directly into the repl, for example code point 20ac prints directly as
 its symbol.

 It seems there are a few characters that don't get printed as their symbol

 Thanks for the follow-up report!

 The choice of how to print/write is based on whether the character is
 graphic as reflected by `char-graphic?'.

 The last three all have Unicode general category No, which is not
 currently included in the set of characters for which `char-graphic?'
 returns #t. At the moment, I think that category should count as
 graphic. I'll make that change, unless sorting through precedents
 reminds me of a reason not to.
 
 #\uAD is a soft hyphen with the category Cf. That's a control category,
 which surely should continue to count as non-graphic.
