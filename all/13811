>Description:
The "open" command is used to open the associated editor for a document.  Running it on a .rkt file starts DrRacket correctly when it is installed, but opens both the requested file and a new "Untitled" window.  If DrRacket was already running before "open" is run, the extra window does not appear and the behavior is correct.  I seem to remember this behaving correctly all the time in some previous versions of DrRacket.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a .rkt file somewhere; run the "open" command on it from the shell when DrRacket is not already running.
