 Thanks for the report. It looks like this is the same issue as PR 14893:
 
   http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view%20audit-trail&database=default&pr=14893
 
 Looking at the discussion there, it looks like we came to a conclusion on how
 we should fix it but didn't actually push a fix. My bad.
 
 I will fix it via "Option 2" mentioned in that discussion, but if anyone has
 any better ideas for how these type annotations should work then let me know.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
