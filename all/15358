>Description:
I'm teaching a class this quarter using DrRacket and several students are reporting that it won't launch on the new macOS Sierra.  The symptom is that clicking on the program icon generates a little icon animation from the finder, but nothing happens.  As far as we can tell nothing launches.  I also tried right-clicking on the DrRacket icon on one of the student machines and selecting open and got the same result.  Nothing launches but no apparent error messages or other indications of what might be wrong.  Help/advice/workarounds would be most appreciated.

 FWIW I start DrRacket from spotlight without problems.

 We finally tracked the problem down to Sierra's new path randomization.
 We've updated the ".dmg" for the distribution so that it's signed (in
 addition to signing the executables in the distribution), and that
 should fix the problem for installation on Sierra.
