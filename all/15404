alt-3 on UK mac keyboard does not return the # (cross-hatch?) character.

The UK mac keyboard lacks a '#' key.
The key sequence to generate the character works outside DrRacket (e.g. in safari), but fails inside DrRacket
NB this affects any alt-number combination, but other alt-key combinations appear unaffected.
(next time I buy a laptop I'll make sure to choose one with a dedicated #-key)
>How-To-Repeat:
open DrRacket
set keyboard to 'British'
show keyboard viewer
press alt-3 - no response

 When I set my US mac to the "British" keyboard via software, I see the
 hash key in both DrRacket (and in v6.4 of DrRacket) and in Safari.
 There may be something still different about your setup, tho. If you
 run this:
 
 $ racket -l tests/gracket/showkey.rkt
 
 then you should get a window where you can type keys. Type alt-3 and
 you'll see some output that might help us figure this out. Here is
 what I see (when in British keyboard mode):
 
 1 KEY: "#" = ASCII 35
   rel-code: press
   other-codes: ("‹" = ASCII 8249 "3" = ASCII 51 "£" = ASCII 163 #f)
   mods: ALT
 2 KEY: release
   rel-code: "#" = ASCII 35
   other-codes: (#f "3" = ASCII 51 #f #f)
   mods: ALT
 
 Do you see something different?
