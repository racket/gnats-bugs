>Description:
pre-5.0, the get-directory functionality from mred/filedialog 
used to include a button on the lower left that allowed the 
creation of a new folder during the selection of a folder. 

I am using this a lot when I create images from world
and I believe our students/teachers do too.

Could this functionality be restored please
