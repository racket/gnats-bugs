>Description:
Drawing with a pen constructed using the result of a 
make-color signals an error. It looks like this may be the
result of alpha values being 0-255 in 2htdp, and 0.0-1.0
in mred, or possibly the fact that mred wants a "color%"
rather than 2htdp's "color" structure.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program:

#lang racket

#|
;; this works fine:
(require mred)

(send (new pen-list%) find-or-create-pen (make-object color% 0 0 0 0.5) 15 'solid 'butt 'round)
|#

;; this doesn't work:

(require 2htdp/image)

(define my-pen (make-pen (make-color 0 0 0 255) 15 "solid" "butt" "round"))
(add-line (rectangle 30 30 "outline" "black")
          0 0 30 30 my-pen)


... see this error: 
pen-list% in find-or-create-pen: bad argument combination: (color 0 0 0 255) 15 'solid 'butt 'round
