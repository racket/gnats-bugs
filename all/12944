>Description:
The large "definitions" label that now appears in the definitions
area will get stuck if you scroll down in a large file. By "stuck",
I mean that it will stay in the same place on the text area and
not move with the scrolling text area.

I'll attach a screenshot in a followup.

BTW: is it possible to make these labels disappear when typing?
They look nice, but I'd rather not have them around when actually
working on the file in the buffer.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrRacket
2. Open large Racket file (e.g., collects/racket/contract/region.rkt)
3. Scroll down

 I'm a bit worried that people will be annoyed by them and I'm
 certainly looking for ways to make them easily go away. That seems
 like it would work well (much like how the mouse cursor disappears
 when you start typing).
 
 But did you spot that you can make them go away when you click on them?
 
 Any other ideas along these lines?

 Can we make them much smaller for now? 
 
 And could you show them to Stephen to see whether this is what he had in mind?

 I'd prefer not to make them (much) smaller, actually. I would be
 definitely in favor of ways to make them easier to go away.
 
 Did you find the way that they currently can be disabled?
 
 If not, what did you try?
 
 > And could you show them to Stephen to see whether this is what he had in mind?
 
 I'll try to remember to show them to him next time I see him.

 I did not look for the disabling.

 The typing trick is nice.

 Stephen would definitely prefer to see both labels up initially no matter where the mouse is and they should disappear only if you type in the respective area.

 I'm curious what you (or anyone) would intuitively guess would make
 the labels go away.
 
 I'm a bit worried that people won't realize they could disappear and
 thus be turned off by them.

 They should appear in *SL by default and not appear in other languages (or perhaps DmDA languages, too. Mike would have to be consulted)
