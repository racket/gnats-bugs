>Description:
The following problems occur in nightly builds starting from 5.3.3.3.

Problem 1:
after downloading a nighly build from internet explorer (windows 7) the downloader complains that the download is not safe. Nevertheless, executing the installer does work. This problem is rather old (even before version 5.3.3.3)

problem 2:
Selection of Racket documentation in DrRacket does open, but when searching, the search is done in a non existing directory. In stead of looking in the installed doc directory, the search engine looks in ...\roaming\racket\version\doc
Copying the doc directory from the installed tree into ...\roaming\racket\version\ does work.

Problem 3:
Downloads of the nightly builds of the last week cannot start DrRacket. When opening DrRacket, it is closed without any warning and even before the staring up window is shown. One time I have seen Windows showing a message that it aborted DrRacket.

Problem 4:
Sometimes DrRacket complains that it cannot access or delete an existing file. Making sure that both the installed tree and the racket application data folder have no read-only compmponents, does help.

Best wishes, Jos

 The doc problem does not occur in the 32 bit version of 5.3.4.7.
 The downloader (in internet-explorer, windows) remains complaining about not
 finishing normally, though.
 I did not yet try the 64 bit version of 5.3.4.7.
 Thanks, Jos
