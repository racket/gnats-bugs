>Description:
Downloaded and installed version 5.3.4.3 (regular and full) from http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/.

DrRacket crashes on start. Windows indicates it has shutdown the application for a DEP violation.
Example:
Problem signature:
  Problem Event Name:	BEX
  Application Name:	DrRacket.exe
  Application Version:	0.0.0.0
  Application Timestamp:	5174e9ce
  Fault Module Name:	StackHash_1703
  Fault Module Version:	0.0.0.0
  Fault Module Timestamp:	00000000
  Exception Offset:	0099e340
  Exception Code:	c0000005
  Exception Data:	00000008
  OS Version:	6.0.6002.2.2.0.768.3
  Locale ID:	1033
  Additional Information 1:	1703
  Additional Information 2:	2264db07e74365624c50317d7b856ae9
  Additional Information 3:	1344
  Additional Information 4:	875fa2ef9d2bdca96466e8af55d1ae6e

Windows Event Viewer show an application error for each attempted start.
Example: 
Faulting application DrRacket.exe, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x5174e9ce, faulting module unknown, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x00000000, exception code 0xc0000005, fault offset 0x00b702c8, process id 0x1e74, application start time 0x01ce3f9af697f3b0

Note: fault offest, process id and start time all vary, all other fields are constant for each report.

Version 5.3.3 downloads and installs ok.
