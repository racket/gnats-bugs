 FWIW this works for me (using), so it might be an issue due to a
 foreign keyboard.
 
 BTW, what about using C-[ and C-] to insert square brackets?

 Just in case: I recently pushed a change to make control-shift-[ and
 control-shift-] be the tab adjustment keys (under windows) to avoid
 conflicting with the control-[ for square brackets.

 Yep, I've tried it again with US-Keyboard Layout and that works well, unlike
 the German-Keyboard-Layout.

 Can you remind me which keys you press for Ctl-\, Ctl-[, and Ctl-] on a
 German-keyboard layout? Is AltGr involved?

 AltGR is necessary for \, [ and ], but in DrRacket 5.0.2 it is enough to =
 press
 Ctrl + "The Key where \ is located" - it's not necessary to press Ctrl + =
 AltGr + "The Key where \ is located" (which also doesn't work).
 
 I've detected more Problems (compared with the behavior of 5.0.2) with =
 keybindings:
 - "ctrl + ;" should open the preferences-menu=20
 - "ctrl + /" should complete words=20
 - "ctrl + shift + A" should search backwards, actually it writes the =
 character =C5=87 into editor

 Thanks! I've pushed a commit to close the PR, even though ctl-shift-A
 doesn't search backwards on my machine --- either for 5.0.99.x or
 5.0.2. I think that must be some configuration issue, so let me know if
 you still see problems.
