>Description:
If I start up DrScheme when the initial language is a student language, I not only get the macro stepper button, but I get *2* check syntax buttons.  If I change to "Determine language from source" then back, I see only the single check syntax button as expected.

This also happens for other languages like EOPL (haven't tested the others yet).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Change to a student language or EOPL.
2. Quit DrScheme.
3. Start DrScheme.
4. Look at the toolbar.
