>Description:
Function renderers that are not as large as the plot area evaluate the function over the entire plot area. They should evaluate it only within the intersection of the plot bounds and their own bounds, and just outside.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang racket
(require plot)

(define count 0)
(plot (function (Î» (x) (set! count (+ 1 count)) x) 0 1/100)
      #:x-min 0 #:x-max 1)
count


This evaluates to a plot and the number 1000. The number should be much smaller, since only 5-6 points on the function are actually drawn.
