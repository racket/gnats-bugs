 Thanks for the report!
 
 This bug is essentially the same as PR 13633:
   http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&audit-trail&database=default&pr=13633
 
 I don't think the problem in general has been fixed yet, but the mailing
 list thread on PR 13633 had a workaround suggested by Sam that you may
 be able to adapt:
