This breaks the common benchmark harness for Gambit.

 Good! That should teach you running around with other Schemes :-)

 I can replicate the problem even when I disable `readline'.

 The problem is that when places are enabled, SIGCHLD wasn't unblocked
 in a fork()ed process.
 
 I'll push a repair, but I will switch the PR over to Kevin (instead of
 closing the PR) so he can think about whether anything else in places
 might interfere with fork().

State changed from "open" to "closed" by tewk at Tue, 26 Apr 2011 14:32:00 -0400
Reason>>> Talked with Matthew.  We couldn't come up with any other
place-fork concerns.
