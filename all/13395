>Description:
The Unity interface in Ubuntu 12.04 hides the
"Add Teachpack..." menu item.  If you disable
the global application menu feature, that (and other items) are correctly displayed.

Below is a link to some suggestions on disabiling the global application menu feature.

>How-To-Repeat:
Download and install racket-5.3.1  from racket.org and try and run drracket.  Observe that menu items are not visible.

The version of drracket available via apt-get also has this problem, as well as others.
