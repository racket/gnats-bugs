>Description:
This,

    '(+i -i 0+i 0-i)

is a list of numbers which is equal to 

    '(1+1i 1-1i 0+1i 0-1i)

but according to the regexp in the docs [1] none of the numbers in the original list parse as numbers. Note that the regexps following the <sign> regexp in <inexact-complex> and <exact-complex> are not nullable.

R5RS special cases these four structures in 7.1.1 .
