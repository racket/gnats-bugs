>Description:
I'll let our various candidates for the current maintainer of slatex slug it out for who gets to fix this:

<collects>/slatex/slatex-wrapper.rkt: 
  (file
   /Users/cce/git/work/plt/collects/slatex/slatex-wrapper.rkt)
 broke the contract (-> string? boolean?) on slatex/no-latex; expected <boolean?>, given: #<void>

 === context ===
/Users/cce/git/work/plt/collects/racket/contract/private/blame.rkt:54:0: raise-blame-error
/Users/cce/git/work/plt/collects/slatex/slatex-launcher.rkt: [running body]
>How-To-Repeat:
I ran "rubber -o expand <DOCUMENT-NAME>" on a document including slatex code, with the slatex.py module present in the same directory.  I don't know exactly how rubber and slatex.py conspire to construct a slatex command line; hopefully the contract error will be relatively easy to track down.
