>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
The 3-line file below works fine with the HTML button. 

#lang scribble/base 
@(require scriblib/figure)
@figure["fig1" "Hello World"]{Good Bye, World}

When I use the PDF button, I get 

Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.1.3.6--2011-08-30(936b51a/g) [3m].
Language: scribble/base.
scribble: loading xref
scribble: rendering
The file /Users/matthias/Trash/Tmp/foo.pdf does not exist.

When I run scribble --pdf foo.scrbl on this file, I am getting the pdf I want. 

(I have seen a similar problem before. DrRacket signals a 'strange' error when something about scribble fails. The error I saw yesterday was "could not find doc" or something like that. I couldn't reconstruct that bug in today's version of drr.)
