Attempting to run Parcheesi from the "PLT Games.exe" launcher menu results in:


preferences:set-default: tried to call set-default for preference 'external-browser but it cannot be configured any more

Should it somehow matter, the only other (than IE) web browser I have installed is Firefox.  It's up to date, and set to default.  The other games seem to be able to use it successfully to display their help pages.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to launch Parcheesi from the menu.  You should get a error popup instantly.  It happens reliably for me.

 I think that maybe you opened some other game and opened the
 preferences dialog and then started having this problem? Restarting
 PLT Games should eliminate the problem in the short term. I'll push a
 fix so this doesn't happen anymore shortly.
