>Description:
I downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2008 Express SP1 [1] and used it to compile Racket from a git clone. 
The problem is that the file devenv.exe doen't exist. The new name is VCExpress.exe.

I made a copy of VCExpress.exe and renamed the copy to devenv.exe . This solves the problem and I could build Racket. (It's not a very elegant solution, but I wanted to minimize the changes in the Racket code.)

I'm not sure which the correct solution is. Perhaps it is possible to use the "where" bath command to see whether devenv or vcxpress is available.

>How-To-Repeat:
1) Install the Visual Studio 2008 Express SP1 [1]
2) Go to the folder [git]\racket \src\worksp
3) Run build.bat

Result: "devenv" not found
