>Description:
odd? has the wrong negative filter, it says that if it returns falze its argument is Zero. It should say that if it returns true that its argument is not Zero. 

I'm not sure why it has a filter like that, but if that is intentional even? should have a corresponding thing. And there maybe should be something for One aswell.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(: foo (Integer -> Zero))
(define (foo n)
    (if (odd? n)
       0
       n))

(: ZERO Zero)
(define ZERO (foo 2))

ZERO
