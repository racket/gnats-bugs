 I was taking a look at this again, and it seems the biggest issue is that
 there is no way to attach user information onto a ctype. The best I could
 do would be to attach information onto one of the procedures passed in.
 
 So my plan would be to make a executable struct that allowed extracting the
 symbols of an enum out, and checking that in the implementation of
 _enum->predicate. Any better ideas?
