>Description:
If I take a square of length s, color c, and mode solid and use above and beside to construct a larger square consisting of four copies of the first square it is not the same as a solid square of length 2s and color c.

It could be that in expecting the two to be equal I'm exposing a bug in my own reasoning, otherwise it's a bug in the code.

Reason>>> appears to have been fixed some time in the last 2 or so years.

 When I run this program, I see no errors.
 
 I suggest you upgrade. You appear to be 7 versions behind.
