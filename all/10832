>Description:
The constructor make-bundle in 2htdp/universe produces an incorrect error message when the 3rd argument has an incorrect type. The error message says that a list of mails is expected when the third argument should be a list of iworlds.

Example:

> (make-bundle 0 empty 'bad-list-of-iworlds)
make-bundle: expected <list [of mails]> as third argument, given: 'bad-list-of-iworlds


From documentation: 

(make-bundle state mails low) â†’ bundle?
  state : any/c
  mails : (listof mail?)
  low : (listof iworld?)
creates a bundle from a piece of data that represents a server state, a list of mails, and a list of iworlds.
>How-To-Repeat:
(make-bundle 0 empty 'bad-list-of-iworlds)
