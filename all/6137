>Description:
The time/date procedures such as "current-seconds"
and "seconds->date" deal only in local time, rather than
supporting other time zones.

There also does not seem to be a practical way to
construct a "date" struct given a date, time of day,
and time zone (or even without the time zone), since
the "week-day" and "year-day" fields must be computed.

It looks like the "net" collection might be waiting on
the ability to construct "date" structs for arbitrary
time zones too.

 There is a find-seconds procedure that searches for the dates, but it
 is slow (it does a binary search....)

 Unfortunately, "find-seconds" doesn't support arbitrary timezones, which
 is a problem for various Internet protocols, UTC timestamps on digital
 camera images, etc.
 
 I may be able to use an add-on SRFI-19 implementation for my immediate
 tasks, but I think MzScheme would really benefit from making
 arbitrary-timezone functionality standard.

 Right -- we definately have work to do. I just pointed that out in case
 you missed it and could use it. As always, man power is the missing
 ingredient. If you would like to contribute something, please don't
 hesitate.
