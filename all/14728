Occasionally, when I open DrRacket, the "Open Recent" file list is not populated. I'm running 6.1 on OSX 10.9.4. Previously (< 6.1) I could usually get the list to populate by doing something else (e.g. open preferences) first and then go back to the File menu, but I just tried that and it didn't work, so I quit DrRacket and started it again and the Open Recent lis was populated this time.

I've recently upgraded OSX to Mavericks (10.9.4), but this was happening on Snow Leopard (10.6.8) also.

As I mention below, I can't reliably reproduce this, but I thought I'd submit a report anyway in case an inspection of the code by someone who is familiar with it shows the problem.

 Right after starting DrRacket selecting "Open Recent" will show an empty list.
 Choose nothing.
 Then choose "Open Recent" again and it will be populated.

 This is, sadly, a well-known problem and has been with us for a long
 time. I have not been able to figure out how to reproduce it, tho, so
 it is not clear how to fix it.

 I think behavior has gotten worse in 6.1. Before, the problem would only happen occasionally. Now, with 6.1, DrRacket seems to start up with an unpopulated recent items list the majority of the time. In fact, the last half dozen times I just tested resulted in an unpopulated recent items list.
 
 I don't get an empty list for recent items when this happens, instead open recent doesn't expand at all, so I can't choose nothing.
 
 Two things I've found just now that cause the list to be populated consistently are:
 1) Click the DrRacket menu, and then go back to recent items.
 2) Press CMD-R (even though there's nothing to run i.e. just the empty, new window)
 
 So, it seems that some UI events trigger the population.
 
 It's not a big deal. Once I get further along in my Racket learning, I may look into the code and see what I can find.
