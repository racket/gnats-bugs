>Description:
Hello,

the program below works well with Racket 5.3 on Windows XP but not with Racket 5.3 on Ubuntu 12.04. After moving the slider, the new sider value is not shown in the message area until the main window has been resized.

#lang scheme

(require racket/gui)

(define (t5)
  (let* ((frame (new frame%
                     [label "t5"]))
         (quit (new button%
                    [parent frame]
                    [label "Quit"]
                    [stretchable-width #t]
                    [stretchable-height #t]
                    [font (make-object font% 18 'roman 'normal 'bold)]
                    [callback (lambda (b e) (send frame show #f))]))
         (pane (new horizontal-pane%
                    [parent frame]))
         (txt (new message%
                   [parent pane]
                   [label "0"]
                   [auto-resize #t]))
         (slider (new slider%
                      [parent frame]
                      [label #f]
                      [style '(horizontal plain)]
                      [min-value 0]
                      [max-value 99]
                      [callback (lambda (s e) (send txt set-label (number->string (send s get-value))))])))
    (send pane set-alignment 'center 'center)
    (send frame show #t)))


Best regards
Frank

 Thanks for the report! You can work around this bug by using
 `horizontal-panel%' instead of `horizontal-pane%'.
