>Description:
Example:

  #lang racket
  (provide main)

  (define (fact n)
    (if (zero? n)
        1
        (* n (fact (sub1 n)))))

  (define (main) (fact 5))

Produces:

$ racket -l trace -tm test.rkt
expr-iterator: unknown expression (phase #f): #<syntax (module configure-runtime (qu...> (module configure-runtime (quote #%kernel) (#%module-begin (#%require racket/runtime-config) (#%app configure (quote #f))))
  context...:
   /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/pkgs/trace/stacktrace.rkt:25:2: top-level-expr-iterator
   /home/asumu/plt/racket-git/pkgs/trace/calltrace-lib.rkt:36:12: loop

It looks like the cause is that `trace` does not support submodules and pretty much
all Racket modules will have at least one submodule these days. Vincent pointed out
that it does still work for student languages though.

(BTW, is `trace` still worth keeping around?)

 One vote for keeping it; I was talking with Todd Millstein a few days ago about a tool he'd built for OCaml that tried to provide better error feedback to early students by comparing, essentially, the trace of a student program with the trace of an instructor program. We talked about implementing this for Racket. Trace would be the obvious first source for this code.

 That doesn't mean it's worth keeping in the main distribution,
 necessarily, right?
