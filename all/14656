>Description:

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt@racket-lang.org at Wed, 23 Jul 2014 05:44:22 -0400
Reason>>> A commit by mflatt@racket-lang.org was marked as relevant
  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/0e4db0a7f0
  | web pages: fix platform sorting on download pages
  | 
  | Fix use of wrong array element during sort, where using the wrong element
  | caused "Windows source" to be sorted before "Windows (x86, 32-bit)".
  | (The wrong-element bug was introduced with changed to support the button
  | that downloads directly from the default mirror.)
  | 
  | Closes PR 14655 and PR 14656


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 23 Jul 2014 05:46:28 -0400
