 Is that a problem?  How much damage can hostile code do by changing the environment of the Racket process that's running it?  Are there places that, for example, Racket reads/writes files as directed by an environment variable, using access that a sandbox wouldn't have?

 Changing PATH seems like it could be very dangerous.

 Yeah, changing environment variables is not protected...  I always
 wanted to get to implement something similar to Emacs, where the
 environment would be represented as a parameter holding an alist or
 something similar, and one of the benefits of that is that it would
 get protected by default with other parameters.

 That's not the only problem: you might want to run some subprocess in
 one sandbox and have it not interfere with another.
 
 But more than that -- it's a security problem, since you can't easily
 remove dangerous environment variables.  For example:
 
     (let ([e (make-evaluator 'racket/base)])
       (map e '((getenv "HOME")
                (getenv "XAUTHORITY")
                (getenv "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"))))

 Only if other code executes things outside the sandbox later on based on a PATH lookup.  So I guess the real question is: what (if any) non-sandboxed code runs in the same process after sandboxed code has run?

 I should have sent this to the bug itself, not just to Stephen:
 
 I noticed this because my IRC bot ("rudybot", generally present in #scheme
 and #racket on freenode) evaluates code in a sandbox.  Recently someone
 changed the HOME environment variable to some more-or-less random value,
 and later I noticed that the bot's language translation was failing with an
 error.  That turned out to be because the translation uses a Google API;
 that API requires authentication; my credentials live in a racket
 preference; and the call to 'get-preference' apparently consults the HOME
 environment variable to locate the preference file.

 I don't use the sandbox, but I could imagine homework submission
 programs do, and then maybe use other tools to write the actual grades
 to a database. Or if multiple sandboxes are run in the same process,
 this allows a channel of communication between them.
