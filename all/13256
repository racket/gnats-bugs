>Description:
The following code causes a segfault:

  #lang racket
  
  (call-with-composable-continuation
   (Î» (k)
     (continuation-mark-set-first 5 #f)))

Note that `5` is an ill-typed argument for `continuation-mark-set-first`. It
doesn't segfault when a correct argument is provided. This only happens within
either a `call-with-composable-continuation` or within `call/cc` as far
as I have seen so far.

I've tried this on this git build (see bug report info), Racket 5.3, and
Racket 5.2.1 and could reproduce the segfault. No segfault on PLT Scheme
4.2.5 or 4.90.0.1.
