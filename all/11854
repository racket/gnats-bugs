 I just downloaded the nightly version (version 5.1.1.2--2011-04-17(d1ddc83/a) [3m]), and am still getting the same error on the same simple file. Is there any other useful information that might help distinguish my machine from yours?

 Ah. I think I know what's happening. Try setting your language. (I'll
 look into a fix.)

 I've just closed this PR because I think that I've fixed it. I still
 had trouble actually making the error happen myself in precisely the
 way Eric did (I can make the error happen by writing a macro that
 prints out specials during expansion time and then using the module
 browser on that file), tho, so I'm not completely sure. Please do
 re-open the PR if you can still get this bad behavior.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 So I tried the most recent version, and the symptom is fixed but the module browser does not work correctly. The box that should show up for the module does not. This only happens if the language setting is not set. It also was a lot faster, likely it errored out before most of the work.
 
 I could not find a way through DrRacket to turn this back to the default setting, but by removing the right line from the Preferences file I achieved it. The line for me was:
 
 (plt:framework-pref:drracket:language-settings ((-32768) (#6(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #0() "#lang racket\n" #t #t))) 
 
 in the file ~/Library/Preferences/org.racket-lang.prefs.rktd
