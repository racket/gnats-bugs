>Description:
I spent a few minutes trying to help out a somewhat stressed student who was not able to get the class .plt file to install.

Problem: incorrect URL, which did not get reported as such.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to install .plt from

http://www.cs.brown.edu/nothing-here

The output is:

gnu-unzip: bad header
  context...:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket\5.3\collects\mzlib\inflate.rkt:857:2: do-gunzip
not an unpackable distribution archive
  context...:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket\5.3\collects\setup\unpack.rkt:271:7

This makes it look like the server is misconfigured or the file is corrupted, when in fact it should just say "nothing exists at that URL, please check and try again".
