Moving an expression from def'n to int'n loses contract violations.

Def window:

(: len ((list-of String) -> Number))

(len (list 1 2 3))
--> contract violation box

But move the last line into the definitions window, and you get the answer 3 and no violations.

Reason>>> this is a well-known incompleteness in the implementation. we 
don't need an internally generated PR for it.

 This is a well-known bug. I'm not sure if there is a PR on the
 subject, but given that it is on the todo list, there have been
 discussions about it between Mike me and others, and I've lost control
 of my PR list, I'm going to just close this PR.
