>Description:
The program below used to typecheck correctly as of commit c10a059, but no longer does so as of commit 0e7940ab4943600e6f5c8f13ce7ee13e8af9a8f5.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket/base

(struct: (State)
         process ([state : State])
         #:transparent)

(define-type Process            (All (R) (CoProcess R) -> R))
(define-type (CoProcess R)      (All (State) (process State) -> R))

(: x : (All (A) (All (State) (process State) A -> A) A Process -> A))
(define (x f seed wp)
  (let ()
    (: coproc : (All (State) (process State) -> A))
    (define (coproc p)
      ((inst f State) p seed))
    ((inst wp A) coproc)))
