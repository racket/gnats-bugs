>Environment:
Debian GNU/Linux 7.1 amd64
>Description:
When the mod procedure from R6RS is called as (mod 2.9e+18 -1/1000000000000000) it returns -512.0. According to the R6RS the return value can't be negative.

This also applies to div-and-mod, mod0 and div0-and-mod0.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program with plt-r6rs:
(import (rnrs))
(let-values (((n_d x_m) (div-and-mod 2.9e+18 -1/1000000000000000)))
  (display (list n_d x_m))
  (newline))
It should print {-2.9e33 0.0}, but it prints {-2.9e+33 -512.0}.
