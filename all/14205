>Description:
The documentation for the traverse method of the render<%> interface does not make sense. It reads: 

"Performs the traverse pass, producing a hash table that contains the replacements for and traverse-blocks and traverse-elementss. See render for information on the dests argument."

It is unclear what kind of elements are used as keys for the hash table, and what kind of values are stored in it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Read documentation for traverse at http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/renderer.html?q=traverse#%28meth._%28%28%28lib._scribble%2Fbase-render..rkt%29._render~3c~25~3e%29._traverse%29%29
