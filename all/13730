>Description:
In 13.1 of the reference, namespace-require and friends take a quoted-raw-require-spec, but that type or contract or whatever isn't a link to anything that helps me understand what a quoted-raw-require-spec is. I searched on the page and looked at the guide page about namespaces but couldn't find anything. I couldn't find any examples that would help me either.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Find someone who isn't an expert on require and is completely new to namespaces.
2. Point them to reference 13.1 and ask them to figure out what quoted-raw-require-spec is.

p.s. Make sure they are average to less-than-average intelligence so it's more likely to reproduce my situation.

 While waiting for a docs update, a quoted-raw-require-spec is the same as
 the argument to #%require, but where you put a quote on the front. For
 example:
 
   'racket/base
   ''#%kernel
   '(only racket/list first)
 
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html?q=%23%25require#%28form._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._~23~25require%29%29

 I think a link to #%require would help. Any examples in the documentation
 help a ton in my opinion, so adding the examples you sent me to the end of
 the #%require docs would also help.
