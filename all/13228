>Description:
I have a really long section, so I gave it its own @(table-of-contents) at the top.  This renders just fine in the HTML version -- in fact, it's nicer than the one in the left gutter, because it isn't clogged up with all the literate programming chunk headers -- but in PDF, there's a blank page and then just text.
>How-To-Repeat:
The LaTeX output has

===
\section[Representing...]{Representing...}\label{t:x28part...}

\newpage \tableofcontents \newpage

As programs grow...
===

in the corresponding place.  It would appear \tableofcontents was not designed to be used in nested contexts.  But it's so useful!

 In acse yuo haven't tried it already, you may want
 `@(local-table-of-contents)', which will at least avoid the blank space
 in PDF output.
