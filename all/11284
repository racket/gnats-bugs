 I'm tempted to say I don't care because insta is really designed for
 inside DrRacket. Is there a way to detect if you are running in
 DrRacket? Can you (Eli) suggest some more agnostic text to display?

 I'm thinking about it as a nice hook from some course to "real code",
 where a student can run some web server to impress friends...  The
 explicit reference to DrRacket might lead them to think that it's
 required.

 "Stop this program at any time to terminate the Web Server." ?
