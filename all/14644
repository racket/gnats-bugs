>Description:
Redex traces ignores the initial-char-width parameter
when the font size is changed in the traces window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program; the term fits on one line.

Resize the font and it will break over multiple lines.

#lang racket
(require redex)
(define-language L)
(define r
  (reduction-relation L (--> any any)))

(initial-char-width 80)
(traces r (make-list 20 'x))

  | stop telling the traces windows to re-format expressions when the font size changes
  | 
  | I'm not sure why it was doing this before, but in addition to fixing PR
  | 14644, this should also make the font size slider a lot more responsive.
  | 
  | also, redraw the editor after changing the font size to make sure
  | the blue arrows get redrawn properly.
  | 
  | closes PR 14644
