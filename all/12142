>Description:
The debug-tool.rkt method (register-vars frame) prints the value portion of a variables to variables-text without regard for its length.  Anything but a small (format ...) string slows the text% instance to a crawl.

I notice that the truncate function is within the same file and would assume that its judicious application in the variables value display would greatly improve the usability.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base

(define (function-for-exposition bytes)
  ; SET BREAK POINT HERE and try debugger in Dr. Racket
  (let ((len (bytes-length bytes)))
    (+ 123 len)))

(function-for-exposition (make-bytes 5000))

 I wouldn't normally ask bug submitters this, but since you've had a
 look at the source, if you'd like to supply a patch that works well
 for you, I'll look it over and commit it.

 THanks! I've pushed that diff and then I also made a small change so
 there is an ellipsis when the bytes get truncated.
 
 Greg: if you want I can close the PR. I thought you might want to have
 a look too, tho, to see if that's okay or if other similar changes
 come to mind.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
