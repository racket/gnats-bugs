When Advanced Student is selected in the language selector, I cannot use the set! function to change the value of a variable defined in the Interactions window. When I attempt to do so, I receive the following error: 
set!: expected a mutable variable after set!, but found a variable that cannot be modified
>How-To-Repeat:
Select Advanced Student in the language selector. Then in the Interactions window, type something like the following:
(define test "something")
(set! test "something else")
You will get this error:
set!: expected a mutable variable after set!, but found a variable that cannot be modified: test

 On further investigation, I'm not convinced that the behavior in v6.12
 is the intended behavior. It seems more likely that I broke the example
 with a change in Racket, and the behavior will change back (unless we
 decide otherwise) because the expander bug has been corrected for the
 next release.
 
 Some details: The example in the PR worked before v6.9. It changed in
 v6.9 due to commit 03f2deeea9, which was a change to the way
 `module->namespace` works. The `module->namespace` function has a
 history of problems in the current release's macro expander, and we're
 solving that underlying problem with a new expander implementation. Not
 coincidentally, the new expander implementation (which will be in the
 next release) restores the old behavior for `define` and `set! in the
 interactions window for ASL. Also, it turns out that we already have a
 test case that exposed the problem in 03f2deeea9; unfortunately, due to
 some confusion about the test case and/or right behavior even then, the
 test got changed instead of the expander.

 Ah! In that case I take it all back.
