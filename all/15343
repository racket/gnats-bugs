MacIntel / Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36
>Description:
At the end of 
https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html#%28part._.Using_an_.S.Q.L_database%29
where it says:

And our application is:

#lang web-server/insta
 
(require "model-3.rkt")
 
....

it should include a note that the string on line 12 of the application should be "the-blog-data.sqlite" and not "the-blog-data.db" in case one interprets .... as invitation to copy and paste the application code from the end of the previous chapter, https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html#%28part._.A_.Persistent_.Model%29

Copy and paste of the application code without this change produces following exception:
Servlet (@ /servlets/standalone.rkt) exception:
table-exists?: file opened that is not a database file
  error code: 26
  database: #<path:/Applications/Racket v6.6/share/pkgs/web-server-lib/web-server/default-web-root/htdocs/the-blog-data.db>
  mode: 'create
  file permissions: (write read)
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Copy and paste model code from the end of https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html#%28part._.Using_an_.S.Q.L_database%29
and save it as model-3.rkt

2) Copy and paste application code from the end of https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html#%28part._.A_.Persistent_.Model%29
and save it as app.rkt

3) Modify line 3 of app.rkt to be 
(require "model-3.rkt")
and save it

4) Run app.rkt
