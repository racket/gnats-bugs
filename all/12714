#|Problem: I have a message% control called x-pos parented by a frame% called parent1. I have a canvas% subclass called canvas parented under frame% parent2. I would like x-pos to always show the current x coordinate of the mouse position over canvas, and for this to be kept up to date as the mouse moves. When the mouse moves, message is updated and displays, but only the first digit. It truncates the string sent to it if the label upon message% init is smaller than the label string sent to it.

message% does not resize automatically, and I needed to set the auto-resize field to #t. It also didn't show in my original test-sort of a heisenbug because I used a really long initial label in my test scenario.
 
From
http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/message_.html
"If auto-resize is not #f, then automatic resizing is initially enanbled (see auto-resize), and the message% objectâ€™s graphical minimum size is as small as possible." -> this doesn't appear to be the case here. Windows XP, Racket 5.1

I don't have a linux box to test atm, but I wonder if the default for the auto-size field is #t there. If so, either the docs are incorrect, or the windows implementation. If not, docs need to be updated. I'd be glad to help in any way possible.|#

 It might be clearer to say
 
  If `auto-resize' is specified as true value, then...
 
 but the convention throughout the documentation is that optional
 arguments have defaults, and the prose assumes a default if no explicit
 value is provided for the argument. Defaults are shown in the blue box
 alongside contracts, and the blue box for the `message%' constructor,
 ends with
 
   auto-resize : any/c = #f
 
 indicating that `auto-resize' is #f by default.
