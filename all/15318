 The Racket REPL does not support line editing out of the box.
 
 To enable it, you can enable the enhanced REPL [1] using:
 
     (require xrepl)

 But the repl in Windows works fine with direction keys;
 And my machine is MacBook Pro running Macos x, the direction keys in the keyboard (not external keyboard) function incorrectly.

 Yes, that's consistent with what Vincent is saying. XREPL also works
 under windows and it does more than what windows does by default. It's
 worth checking out.
