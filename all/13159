>Description:
In ASL, the debugger is not behaving as it does in #lang racket, nor is it behaving as documented (in the DrRacket manual).  Specifically, I find that when I click Debug in an ASL program: the entire program executes without pause; the "Go" and "Step" buttons are nonfunctional; breakpoints I subsequently set (including after 2 or more clicks of the Debug button) appear to be ignored; and the debugger doesn't offer the option of setting breakpoints in places where I would expect them to be possible (or, indeed, where it permits them in #lang racket).
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter this program, click Debug, attempt to set breakpoints, click Debug again:
;; ---
(define (! n)
  (cond [(= 0 n) 1]
        [(> n 0) (* n (! (sub1 n)))]))

(! 6)
(! 7)
;; ---
