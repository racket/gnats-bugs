One test case (out of forty) in picturing-programs/tests/map-image-bsl-tests.rkt fails because a particular pixel of a particular image file now has a different numeric value than it did before.

 We upgraded various native libraries for v6.0.1.x, including libjpeg. I
 bet the new libjpeg is producing a slightly different decoding.

 Yes, do this if you can.
 
 If the point is to compare JPEGs, you should compare images in a way 
 that's not sensitive to differences of 1-2 color levels per pixel. The 
 JPEG FAQ [1] says "what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors, 
 but thousands of colors... different JPEG decoders would give you 
 different results because of roundoff error differences." Also that 
 decoders may trade image quality for decoding speed.

 No, the point isn=92t to compare JPEGs.  The point is to give beginning =
 students some =93standard=94 pictures to work with (in variables =
 predefined by the package), and some of the =93standard=94 pictures I =
 gave them happened to come from photographs, which are typically stored =
 in JPEG format.
 
 As it turns out, only one of those standard pictures is a JPEG at =
 present.  The answer, I guess, is to convert it to a PNG once and for =
 all and include that (rather than the JPEG) in the package.  The result =
 will be slightly different depending on whether I convert it with 6.0 or =
 6.0.1.3, but in either case it should be immune to future renderer =
 changes (right?).
