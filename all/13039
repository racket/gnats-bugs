>Description:
Hi,

Maybe you want to double check the contents of "wrapped-simple-factory-unit.rkt"
in Section 14.6.2 of The Racket Guide:

1. The last line of "wrapped-simple-factory-unit.rkt":

   (provide contracted-simple-factory@)

I believe it should be

   (provide wrapped-simple-factory@)

Best regards,
lee
