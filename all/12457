>Description:
I started DrRacket from directory "/home/user", then opened in DrRacket the "collects/planet/raco.rkt" from the Racket install tree.  When I used the Jump to Definition operation on "start" in that file, I got the error:

normalize-path: #<path:/home/user/private> (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist

"start" comes from:

(require "private/cmdline-tool.rkt")

It appears that this operation was not resolving that path relative to the directory of "raco.rkt".

 I believe this has been fixed. Please let me know if you still see it
 in a more recent version.
