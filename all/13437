>Description:
A student apparently checked "Enable tracing" in setting up BSL for his homework, and this caused his programs to produce the following error:

  let-values: cannot use identifier tainted by macro transformation

I don't know if there is an intended use for tracing in BSL, but it might be good to disable it, or fix the BSL implementation so it fails more gracefully.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; Enter this program in Definitions, and run it:
(define-struct a (b))

 Reproducible, and able to isolate it down to calltrace-lib.
 
 
 The following program should demonstrate the same issue:
 
 ---
 #lang racket
 (require trace/calltrace-lib)
 (expand (annotate (expand #'(define-struct x (y)))))
 ---
