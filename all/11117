>Description:
When students make syntactic mistakes or logical ones,
Intermediate (+) uses the word void in error messages. 
Since void isn't introduced until ASL, that's inappropriate. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run the below. It's syn correct but logically illformed. 

(define-struct bx (a b))
(define Doll (signature (mixed Number (bx-of Symbol Doll))))
(: make-bx (Doll -> bx))
(define bx1 (make-bx 10))
