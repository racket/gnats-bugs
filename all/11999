 I won't be able to fix this right away, but the method's name is
 supposed to be get-port-name.

 That works.
 
 In the meantime, I was using get-filename from text%. It seems like
 both are doing the same thing, at least in this case.

 PS: port-name-matches can be _very_ slow on certain filesystems (that
 you probably don't use) so you want to avoid calling it in loops (you
 can cache the result outside of the loop to avoid the pain).

 They don't do the same thing. They differ when the file is not saved.
 What are you using it for?
 
 (You may want port-name-matches too)

 I'm writing a DrRacket tool that, as part of its behavior, calls
 read-syntax on the contents of the definitions window (as a string),
 then does some analysis on the resulting syntax. I use the port name
 to tell read-syntax where its input came from.
 
 I don't know if using read-syntax directly is the best way to do what
 I want, or if DrRacket provides a higher-level operation that does all
 that. But this is getting off-topic, so we should probably take this
 off the bugs list.
