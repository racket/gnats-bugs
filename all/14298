"3"

In racket.exe, it fails.

 The difference between DrRacket and "racket.exe" is that DrRacket keeps
 the expression-consuming stream separate from the current input port,
 while those streams are the same for "racket.exe". Also, the expression
 parser depends on things like matching parentheses instead of newlines
 to determine the end of an expression.
 
 So, when "racket.exe" says
 
   Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.1.
   > 
 
 and you type
 
  (read-line)<return>
 
 then the evaluator consumes
 
  (read-line)
 
 leaving
 
  <return>
 
 in the input stream. The <return> that you pressed is actually
 reflected in the input stream two characters: return and linefeed. So,
 the `read-line` function sees a linefeed in the input string, and the
 line is complete --- containing only a return character.
 
 It's relatively easy for DrRacket to separate the input streams, since
 DrRacket has its own editor, while "racket.exe" just uses the input
 stream at the OS gives it from the terminal.

 Thank you for your quick reply.
 
 But its behavior seems unnatural.
 
 Another problem(?): (read-line) does not remove \r on Windows.
 
 (read-line [in mode]) =E2=86=92 (or/c string? eof-object?)
 
   in : input-port? =3D (current-input-port)  mode : (or/c 'linefeed 'return=
  '
 return-linefeed 'any 'any-one)   =3D 'linefeed
 I think the default mode should be changed to 'any. The current (read-line)
 favors Unix/Linux. That behavior surprises many Windows programmers.
 
 I made a somewhat portable (read-line):
 (define (read-line2)
   (read-line (current-input-port) 'any))

 When we have it to do over again, I agree that 'any should become the
 default instead of 'linefeed. For the current language and binding,
 though, changing the default could break existing programs.
