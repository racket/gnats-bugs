>Description:
With this program in the definitions window, clicking the macro stepper button doesn't launch the macro stepper:

#lang typed/racket
(: hello-world (-> Place))
(define (hello-world) 
   
  (place ch  
         (let: ((ch : Place ch)) ;; fails with "unknown identifier place?"
             (printf "hello-world received: ~a\n" 
                     (place-channel-get ch))
             (define HW "Hello World")
             (place-channel-put ch (format "~a\n" HW))
             (printf "hello-world sent: ~a\n" HW))))
