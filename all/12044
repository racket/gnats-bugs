>Description:
This program raises errors over and over again. Animate should probably stop trying to animate after the first error.

#lang racket
(require 2htdp/universe
         2htdp/image)
(define (f x)
  (cond
    [(= x 0) (circle 10 'solid 'red)]
    [(= x 1) (circle 20 'solid 'red)]
    [else (error 'cond "all questions were #f")]))
