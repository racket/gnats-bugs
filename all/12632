 Many of my students observed problems like this as well, over the last quarter. This may be a red herring, but I'm wondering if this is related to the problems that some students had when they ran DrRacket for the first time directly from a temporarily-mounted disk image, and then wound up with an installation that apparently contained permanent references to these temporary paths.

 This is most likely the same problem as the one in PR12549, and since
 Matthew also added a test that checks for such paths, it should not
 happen again.

The Racket document is attached to this email.
Unfortunately the email service used at my school does not allow me to send 
the email if I use "reply-all", sorry.
If you could forward it to the necessary recipients that would be appreciated. 

Thanks.
