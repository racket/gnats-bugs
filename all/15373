      (printf "~a\n" p))) 
/example/a
/example/b
/example/b/beta
/example/c

I think the output must be:

/example/b
/example/b/beta

Best wishes, Jos

 The prose says
 
     "except for the contents of any directory for which use-dir? returns #f"
 
 which to me means that `use-dir?` only limits what's inside a given
 subdirectory, not the subdirectory either. The example is therefore
 consistent with the prose.
 
 Now, whether or not this is the best design is a different question. Is
 that the one that you intended to raise? If not, I'll close this bug.

 Appologies, I have misunderstood the docs. I see what you mean.
 I think the design is confusing,
 but also that it is better to keep in-directory as it is for backward compatibility.
 Yes please, close the bug report.
 Sorry for the noise.
 Thanks, Jos
