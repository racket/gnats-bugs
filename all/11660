When you create an executable from drracket, you get 
no indication that drracket is still working on it 
other than a lot of GC flickering. 

Could we use a 'wait cursor' instead?

 This is in the module language, right?

 (Yes. I thought that drracket transmitted that info.)

 It looks to me like the module language does show that when it creates
 a distribution. It doesn't seem worth it to show it when it creates a
 launcher because that takes little time.
 
 So I'm adding something like the messages you see for the distribution
 creation (altho just one message) for the stand-alone executable
 creation case.
