>Description:
When running the code below, the on-paint callback calls
erase and then, every other time you click, draws an ellipse. But during the times when the ellipse is not actually drawn, the ellipse still appears in the window.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200][height 200]))
(define show? #t)
(define c (new (class canvas%

                 (define/override (on-event evt)
                   (when (send evt button-up?)
                     (set! show? (not show?))
                     (refresh)))

                   (define dc (get-dc))
