 I think maybe I wasn't clear. This bug is in 5.0.0.900 (downloaded
 just now from the URL in Ryan's bundle testing message), but not in
 the the two months ago release, 5.0.
 
 (Or maybe I just misunderstand you.)

 Interestingly, the "dir" and the "p" in the define-struct show up as
 unevaluated code which also seems like a problem.

 OUCH. I misunderstood you.=20
 
 So it is a show stopper.=20

 The problem was in the change to support contracts. The template for an
 accessor was
 
  #`(define (#,name r)
      (raw-generic-access r #,i) ; error checking
      (check-struct-wraps! r)
      (raw-generic-access r #,i))
 
 where `raw-generic-access' is the `foo-ref' kind of function.
 
 I'll change it to
 
  #`(define #,name
      (let ([raw (make-struct-field-accessor
                  raw-generic-access
                  #,i
                  '#,field-name)])
       (lambda (r)
         (raw r) ; error checking
         (check-struct-wraps! r)
         (raw r))))
