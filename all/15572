In the attached example I draw a box with a final diagonal: Only the last diagonal is visible.

 It should work to use the `inset` function from the pict library to
 get what you want, like this:
 
 #lang racket
 (require graphics/value-turtles
          pict)
 (inset
  (turtles-pict
   (draw 50 (turn 45 (turtles 10 10))))
  10)
