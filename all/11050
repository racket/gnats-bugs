>Description:
In the universe description, the (on-draw ...) handler was renamed to (to-draw ...), but it's still (on-draw ...) in the graphic in section 2.3.3 of the docs.

(By the way, on-draw still works, presumably for backwards compatibility, so it's not a big issue except in terms of consistency.)
