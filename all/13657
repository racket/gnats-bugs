>Description:
There are two technical but important problems with the "pkg create"
command:

1. The help text says "<maybe-dir>", which is unclear.  I naively
   assumed that it is either a directory or an existing collection in my
   installation, and used a name that happens to be an existing
   directory which is not the relevant directory.  This made it work for
   a long time until it stopped with a random error (due to a symlink to
   a nonexistent file).

   Suggestions to resolve this (IMO all of these should be done):

   a. Change `<maybe-dir>' to `<dir>' to clarify that it is expected to
      be a directory.  (My guess is that the "maybe" part is because the
      code checks if it exists -- so it's an implementation detail that
      shouldn't leak out into the help text anyway.)

   b. Make it print "packing <dir>..." when it starts -- so if I make
      the above mistake, I'm aware of it right away instead of waiting
      for a potentially bogus zip to be created and only then realize
      that it's bogus.

   c. Make the documentation page say "raco pkg create <dir>" instead of
      "... <package>".  (This is actually what made me assume that it's
      a name of an existing collection.)

2. When the zip file is created, there is no indication whatsoever on
   its location.  (After I had the above experience, I had to run a
   `find' to check if there was some partially made zip file left.)  In
   addition, it doesn't say anything about the generated checksum file.

   Obvious suggestion: when it's done, print out where the generated zip
   file and the checksum file are left.
