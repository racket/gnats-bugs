>Description:
Right now, the navigation elements in the bottom of the manual pages are manually hidden in manual-style.css:

    .navsetbottom {
        display: none;
    }

This is a bit annoying because right now I have to scroll all the way up to go to the next section of the manual.
>How-To-Repeat:
This problem more annoying in long manual pages, such as https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/syntax-overview.html
>Fix:
