>Description:
The program autoquits on error when trying to save a new, blank file; tried to save a new blank file as a template for future work, but the program failed to do so, and crashed in the process.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket; or, from an already-running window of DrRacket, click <File>, click <New>. Leave the definitions field blank. Click <File>, click <Save Definitions As...>. No "Save As" dialog is displayed. When running from the command prompt in Ubuntu 17.10, returns the error "Error 71 (Protocol error) dispatching to Wayland display.", and quits.
