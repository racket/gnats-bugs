>Description:
(as discussed in email)

1. fire up new drracket so that #lang racket plus empty def window come up. 

2. paste in

#lang typed/racket

(define-type sex (U -1 0 1))

(struct: sexomino
         ((n : sex)
          (e : sex)
          (s : sex)
          (o : sex)))

(: sexomini (Listof sexomino))
(define sexomini
  (let ()
    (define n 0)
    (: f sex)
    (define f -1)
    (define m 1)
    (define s sexomino)
    (list (s n m n n) (s f f n n))))

3. bring up language dialog with cmd-l and use cmd-t to switch to a teaching language. 

4. try switching back with cmd-r: doesn't work. 

5. say okay. 

6. bring up dialog again with cmd-l

7. try to use cmd-r: again, it won't work
