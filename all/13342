>Description:
I can't provide steps to reproduce.

Sometimes the code editor gets into a weird state in which, with the shift key held down to select a block of text, it only grows the selection from the beginning when up/left is pressed, and only grows the selection from the end when down/right is pressed. It should always grow or shrink the selection from the last caret location.

It seemed to start happening after the changes to auto parens, which I don't use yet.

 Is anybody else getting this? My editor is in this state about half the 
 time and it's driving me crazy. If I select more text than I want, I 
 can't select less without starting over.
 
 I've had to retrain myself in how to move text to the previous line. I 
 used to be able to do this, where "." represents text, "*" represents 
 selected text, and "|" is the caret:
 
      (..........
       |....)
 
      (|**********       Shift-Up
 *****....)
 
      (..........|       [Holding Shift] End
 *****....)
 
      (.......... ....)  Space (replaces selected text, including newline)
 
 The "(Holding Shift) End" step doesn't work anymore half the time. It 
 does this instead:
 
      (..........
       |....)
 
      (|**********       Shift-Up
 *****....)
 
      (**********        [Holding Shift] End
 **********|
 
 Since Shift-Up/Shift-End/Space doesn't work, I've had to learn 
 Shift-Home/Delete/Delete/Space, which works consistently.
 
 Something related, which I think only happens when the editor is in this 
 weird forgetful state: it also forgets the caret position when cursoring 
 down past short lines and back into long ones. IOW, it should act like 
 this when cursoring down:
 
      ..........|
      .....
      ...............
 
      ..........
      .....|
      ...............
 
      ..........
      .....
      ..........|.....
 
 But it acts like this sometimes:
 
      ..........|
      .....
      ...............
 
      ..........
      .....|
      ...............
 
      ..........
      .....
      .....|..........
 
 This also makes it difficult to select and delete text, since it 
 sometimes does this when Shift is held.

 That is the way selection used to work way back before it was fixed to work
 as you wish it to work. I believe there is a bit of state saying "this is
 the original position to grow/shrink from" somewhere in text% and it looks
 like it is getting lost. Maybe the thing to do is to add a printf when that
 state changes and then for you to edit and keep an eye on that printf. I
 bet that'll let you be able to tell us how to reproduce it and then it'll
 probably be easy to fix.

 The move-position method in mred/private/wxme/text.rkt is the relevant code
 I believe.
 
 This isn't code that I wrote so I could be missing something, but  it sure
 looks like you want to watch the variables extendstartpos extendendpos
 and extend-streak?.
 
 Matthew may know better; he wrote the code.

 Yeah, it annoyed me too -- and it's still there like Neil says...

 IIRC, it used to do this after a M-left/right which is fixed now, but
 it still does it on a double-click now: write "foo bar baz",
 double-click the middle word, and use S-left/right to see it happen.
 
 (And speaking about editor things, there's also the ancient bug where
 C-left can't skip over an empty line...)

 This one looks like a bug in find-wordbreak:
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define t (new text%))
 (send t insert "a\n\nb")
 (define b (box 3))
 (send t find-wordbreak b #f 'caret)
 (unbox b) ;; = 3
 
 But 3 is probably not the right answer (if I'm not getting mixed up) -- 0
 is.

 Ah, right. And that would indeed be an easy fix as soon as we can reproduce
 the bug.

 response to shift-arrow presses

 Yes.
 
 It may be that a `begin-edit-sequence' somewhere needs a #f second
 argument, which means "don't interrupt the current streak".

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/13342: Selection box sometimes grows wrongly
 in response to shift-arrow presses
Date: Tue, 08 Jan 2013 16:39:01 -0700

 If it helps any, after the selection error starts happening, it keeps 
 happening on new editors. IOW, if I start DrRacket fresh and type a few 
 lines, selection works as it should. It keeps working fine if I open a 
 new tab and start typing.
 
 If it ever starts happening, if I open a new tab and type a few lines, 
 cursoring during selection works wrongly there as well.
 
 I can't recall whether it ever fixes itself.

 Wait-- are you saying that when it gets confused and you open a new tab and
 it is confused in the new tab? That would be strange and not at all what we
 were expecting.

 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 to add a<br>

Date: Thu, 17 Jan 2013 14:29:25 -0700

 I haven't had time to try the patch yet, but I have more information. 
 When the editor is in this weird state,
 
   * Undo undoes *single letters* instead of spans.
 
   * After Shift-Up or Shift-Down, Ctrl-Home never moves the caret.
 
 Also, I've had instances now where the editor somehow gets out of this 
 weird state.

 That could be that begin-edit-sequence's state is getting confused. We'd
 want a different set of printouts for that (I don't know what they are
 offhand).
