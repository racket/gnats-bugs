 Changing line 239 of setup/parallel-build.rkt to
 
   (define dir (path->complete-path (bytes->path _dir)))
 
 makes this error message go away for me. I'm not sure it's the right fix
 since I don't really understand the code, but hopefully it at least
 pinpoints the issue.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Yes the fix seems to be to ensure that dir is a complete-path.
 
 The above change looks ok to me.
 I think Matthew should decide if it's worth changing line 239 this late 
 in the release process.
 
 
 An alternative patch below would be a fix earlier in the setup process 
 but more invasive.
 At this point in the release I would be very hesitant to make a change 
 as big as the one below.

 I don't think we need to fix this. It does not seem to be a recent bug
 and the release is imminent (I hope).
