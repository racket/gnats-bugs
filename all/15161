>Description:
On http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/typed-untyped-interaction.html , 6.3 Protecting Typed-Untyped Interaction, the code samples don't work, preventing the demonstration of the contract error:

(module increment racket
    (provide increment)
  
    ; "increment : exact-integer? -> exact-integer?"
    (define (increment x) "this is broken"))
eval:2:0: code:contract: unbound identifier in module
  in: code:contract

The same code works on my computer, when pasted in an interactive session.

Expected last sample:

(require 'client)
. . ..\..\Program Files\Racket\collects\racket\contract\private\blame.rkt:143:0: increment: broke its contract
  promised: Integer
  produced: "this is broken"
  in: the range of
      (-> any/c Integer)
  contract from: (interface for increment)
  blaming: (interface for increment)
   (assuming the contract is correct)
  at: unsaved-editor307:10.31

Actual last sample:

(require 'client)
require: unknown module
  module name: #<resolved-module-path:'client>

 Thanks for the report!
 
 It looks like Typed Racket's docs rely on an undocumented(?) feature: using
 the `code:contract` form in an interaction form.
 
 It seems like this used to work though. Anyone have any idea what changed in
 Scribble that breaks this? Should TR avoid this feature and switch to using
 `code:comment` or does Scribble need to be fixed?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 It looks like commit e3e73a82861b005ad8c580d57272f578b7348bca in TR
 changed from using `code:comment` to `code:contract`. So, the issue is
 that `code:comment` did work and still works, while `code:comment`
 never worked with `scribble/eval`.
 
 The TR guide could be reverted to use `code:comment`, but I think
 `code:contract` should be documented and `scribble/eval` should be
 fixed to accommodate it, so I'll do that.
 

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 02 Oct 2015 17:40:30 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed by a combination of changes in `scribble/eval` and the
doc source.
