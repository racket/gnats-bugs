>Description:
Hi, I've found the bug in all the versions for mac os(5.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2 Intel 32bit and 64bit). the scrolling of the editor in Drracket is really really really slow when I swipe on my mac(Mac OS 10.8.2). 
>How-To-Repeat:
open a 500-1000 lines of code, and swipe on the definition window of Drracket. the scrolling of the editor is apparently not smooth.
>Fix:
