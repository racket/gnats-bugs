Using HtDP level ”advanced student” with the PLoT graphics library even simple programs like

(plot (line (lambda (x) (cos x)))

      #:x-max 1)

do not work.
I  got the error message „#%datum: keyword used as an expression”.
What is wrong?
Thanks for help.

 The plot library requires linguistic powers beyond those of ASL. 
 
 This is true in general for many Racket libraries, not just for 
 plot. We need to work out a solution for this problem but there 
 aren't any obvious solutions. The teachpack idea was a first 
 attempt to express this constraint. But once we moved teachpacks
 from the top-level of the PLT into the collects level, we "forgot" 
 and failed to worry enough.
