>Description:
Rotating a length-scaled arrow pict still produces a right-pointing arrow, clipped into the rotated version's bounding box. Doing the rotation in scribble instead produces the proper result.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
 
(require pict)
 
(for/list [(i 25)]
  (frame (rotate (scale (arrow 50 0) 2 1) (* pi (/ i 12)))
         #:segment 5
         #:color "blue"
         #:line-width 1))
