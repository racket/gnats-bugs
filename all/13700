>Description:
When I open a file in DrRacket and print it (using Print Definitions), the printer often produces blank pages. Clicking Page Setup (the menu item above Print Definitions, not the tab in the print dialog) and changing the printer in the selection labeled "Format for:" sometimes causes the subsequent printing to succeed. At first it seemed like a reliable correlation, but then it broke down.

(BTW, the "Format for:" value is reset each time the Page Setup dialog is opened, so I'm a little unclear on the duration of the setting.)

I tried this on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.10. I usually changed the print dialog's range setting from All Pages to just page 1.

According to Asumu, experiments on other machines suggest that the problem might be restricted to 64-bit Linux. IIRC, printing worked on 32-bit Linux and 32- and 64-bit Mac. I don't think Windows was tried.
