>Description:
The following program demonstrates that place channels don't allow
the communication of keywords:

  #lang racket
  (keyword? '#:methods)
  (place-message-allowed? '#:methods)

It turns out that for the Typed Racket test harness, it is actually
necessary to send keywords across place channels, so this would be a
useful addition.
