 This query works, looking only for results in the "plot" doc directory:
 
     rectangle T:plot
 
 These too, looking for results in any module path that matches "plot" or
 one that is exactly it, resp.:
 
     rectangle T:plot
     rectangle L:plot
 
 1. You can see these things when you click the "[?]" thing.  Perhaps
    there's some better way to make it more obvious.
 
 2. In case anyone thinks about the "obvious" thing: try one of the
    strings as a module name -- that would be pretty complicated since
    the code is doing a bunch of priorities when looking for stuff.
 
 3. If this is criticism for the possibly outdated concept of search
    operators, then a more direct bug should be filed...
 
    But, to try this, a cheap implementation is to make the JS code add
    the module name to the indexed string (physically), and see how that
    works.  To do this, add a toplevel loop to "search.js" that does
    something like the following (untested):
 
        for (var i = 0; i < plt_search_data.length; i++) {
          var x = plt_search_data[i];
          if (x[3] != "module") x[0] += " " + x[3].join(" ");
        }
 
    (And if it's better then maybe it's fast enough to keep.)
