>Description:
If an error happens in a provide-transformer expression, the macro stepper doesn't finish the expansion and the program continues in the running/Â¿expanding? state (the green arrow in the main window is disabled).

If the macro hiding is disabled, then the macro steeper never shows the last expansion of the program, nor an error.
>How-To-Repeat:
* Write this program
;;===
#lang racket/base
(provide (except-out (a)))
;(provide (all-defined-out a))
;(provide (rename-out (a)))
;(provide (rename-out (all-defined-out)))
;;===

(All these expressions give the same problem.)

* Run the Macro Stepper

* Disable the Macro Hiding

* Press the "End >>|" button to see the last expansion

--> Real Result: Nothing appears. (And in the main window the run arrow is disabled.)

--> Expected Result: Get an error. (And in the main window the run arrow is enabled.)
