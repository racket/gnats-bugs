>Description:
Activating line numbers through preferences by going into edit->preferences and editing->general tab -> "show line numbers".  The menu item in view -> line numbers still says "show line numbers" instead of "hide line numbers".  It seems like the preferences to menu item is not synchronized.  Allthough it does work the other way when changing the view->show/hide line numbers seems to change the preferences.
I'm running DrRacket under windows 7...
>How-To-Repeat:
Make sure line numbers are off.
Go to edit->preferences->editing->general->*check* "show line numbers"

hit ok.  Now you will notice that in the view menu it still says "show line numbers". When clicking on "show line numbers" it turns line numbers off.
