>Description:
In the below racket/load program, I can require the service module as (quote module), and if I rename quote to dynamic-in I can require it as (dynamic-in module).  However, if I wrap that in rename-in, it no longer works.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module service racket
  (#%module-begin))

(module good-client racket
  (#%module-begin
    (require (quote service))))

(module another-good-client racket
  (#%module-begin
    (require
      (rename-in racket/base
        [quote dynamic-in]))
    (require
      (dynamic-in service))))

(module bad-client racket
  (#%module-begin
    (require
      (rename-in racket/base
        [quote dynamic-in]))
    (require
      (rename-in (dynamic-in service)))))
