>Description:
I believe that raise-argument-error has the same contract as raise-type-error (indeed, I believe Matthew designed it as a drop-in replacement), but TR doesn't have it. 

This is just a change-request: I think it would be <5 min 
for a TR developer. 
>How-To-Repeat:
run

#lang typed/racket

raise-argument-error
