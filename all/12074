>Description:
This is a very weird problem that seems to happen with high probability in Windows when I try to make two temporary files with content copied from another file (or from two different files - doesn't matter). It doesn't always happen on every run (see code below), but it definitely only happens when the directory (third argument to make-temporary-file) does not exist at the point the program runs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's the code I run:

#lang racket

(define (check/make-dir dir-path)
  (when (not (directory-exists? dir-path))
    (make-directory dir-path)
    ))

(define (thunk)
  (define dir "c:\\Users\\Nadeem\\Desktop\\yo")
  (check/make-dir dir)
  (define plt "c:\\Users\\Nadeem\\Desktop\\racketui.plt")
  (make-temporary-file "~a.sav" plt dir)
  (make-temporary-file "~a.sav" plt dir))

(thunk)

Now, if the "yo" directory does *not* exist to begin with, then *sometimes*, the following error happens:

copy-file: copy failed; cannot copy: c:\Users\Nadeem\Desktop\racketui.plt to: c:\Users\Nadeem\Desktop\yo\13113964151311396415336.sav

and the second (make-temporary-file ...) expression is highlighted. Looking in the "yo" directory, what has happened is that the first make-temporary-file already created a file with the name indicated in the error. Now, this never happened to me with the program I was working with on Mac OS X, but it has happened repeated on this Windows Vista machine (though not always reliably reproduceable -- sometimes I have to exit DrRacket, delete the "yo" directory, then open the program again and run it to get it to happen). Also, it doesn't happen if I'm not copying a file at the same time as making the temporary file (i.e. if the second parameter is #f). It also never seems to happen if all the expressions are at the top level (i.e. not bundled up in the thunk). Also, as noted already, it never happens if the "yo" directory already exists. Have fun... :-)

 Oh, actually the docs say that copy-file is supposed to raise an
 exn:fail:filesystem:exists? exception, so I guess that that's the bug
 (that it doesn't in this case).

 Looking at the code in collects/racket/file.rkt, it seems like maybe
 copy-file is not raising a exn:fail:filesystem? exception. I'm not
 sure if it should be, or if the with-handlers expression there should
 have a more general predicate, tho, so I didn't try to fix things.

 This problem,
   http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=12074
 is now occurring on Mac OS X. The following program, if the 'yo'
 directory exists, regularly produces (though not with every run) an
 error like "copy-file: destination already exists; cannot copy:
 /Users/nhamid/Desktop/projects.txt to:
 /Users/nhamid/Desktop/yo/13217551971321755197113.sav (File exists;
 errno=17)":
 
 #lang racket
 (define (check/make-dir dir-path)
   (when (not (directory-exists? dir-path))
     (make-directory dir-path)
     ))
 (define (thunk)
   (define dir "/Users/nhamid/Desktop/yo")
   (check/make-dir dir)
   (define plt "/Users/nhamid/Desktop/projects.txt")
   (make-temporary-file "~a.sav" plt dir)
   (make-temporary-file "~a.sav" plt dir))
 (thunk)

 I reimplemented `copy-file' for v5.2 on Unix and Mac OS X, and I didn't
 get the `exn:fail:filesysten:exists?' part right.
 
 I'll push a repair. Unfortunately, it means that `make-temporary-file'
 is broken in the current release, at least when a source file is
 provided.
