 You've phrased this as if it is a check syntax bug. But at first
 glance it looks like check syntax is just reporting what happened
 during expansion. Is that wrong?

 Ah, the macro stepper shows what (I think) is going on.  The teaching
 languages use the `racket' binding of `require', but then
 `module-continue'  *rewrites* that into the `mzscheme' require, which
 then expands again into the `racket' `require'.  This means that check
 syntax has no hope, I think, of providing the correct documentation
 link.
 
 Strangely, none of these bindings are to `beginner-require', which is
 exported as `require' by `htdp/bsl', and which is used in the
 expansion, as demonstrated by the error messages.  Ryan, do you
 understand why the macro stepper doesn't show this?
 
 So now I'm confused, and I can't tell if it's a check syntax bug or not.

 The problem is that the meaning of 'require' is tied to a mutable 
 environment, and both Check Syntax and the macro stepper only show you 
 the environment's final state.
 
 Here's another example:
 
 #lang racket
 (require (only-in racket [quote require]))
 
 Check Syntax will tell you that 'require' means 'quote'... but of course 
 it could only mean 'quote' now if it meant 'require' earlier.
 
 This is one of the reasons I'm ambivalent about shadowing.

 In the short-term is there a rewrite one could do to the teaching
 languages to make it get the right docs?

 Nothing simple comes to mind.
 
 The problem is that after expansion, 'identifier-binding' on the 
 original identifier gives the wrong answer. You could do something very 
 ad hoc like add a table to Check Syntax that overrides the 
 'identifier-binding' lookup, and change BSL 'require' to shout "this 
 identifier meant 'require' at the point when it was actually expanded". 
 You'll have to get the macro (phase 1 code) talking to the Check Syntax 
 back end (phase 0 code); I think Matthew now recommends loggers for 
 cross-phase communication like that.
 
 I would classify this as "infeasible to fix" for now.
