>Description:
If I have the following code:

(require rackunit)

(define (fn a)
  (cond
    [(number? a) 1]
    {else 2}))

(check-equal? (fn "D") 1)

and run it, then correctly the number 1 is highlighted black, since I never test it.

But if instead of 1 I return a false (boolean):

(require rackunit)

(define (fn a)
  (cond
    [(number? a) false]
    {else 2}))

(check-equal? (fn "D") 1)

then false is not highlighted black and it should be because we never test it. Is this a bug?

 Replace 'false' with '#f' to increase the accuracy of test coverage for now. 
 I will leave it to Robby to figure out how these relate.

 I've pushed a fix for the macros, but I didn't close the PR because it
 needs a test case. I hope I can leave that to you. If not, perhaps
 someone can at least suggest a place for it. (I don't think that this
 should be a test coverage test case.)
