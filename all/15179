>Description:
Hello, 

Whenever I run a test, the test result window opens at a relatively small size. This is annoying since for almost every test, I have to expand the window to see what the results are.

Is there a hidden setting to change the default size of the test result window or some configuration I can change somewhere?

I'm just starting programming and I really like Racket (minus the really small test result window!).

Thank you!

James
>How-To-Repeat:
Run any check-expect and the test result window is a relatively small square that needs to be resized in many cases.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 14 Nov 2015 12:16:09 -0500
Reason>>> 
this has been fixed with this commit:

https://github.com/racket/htdp/commit/fd061b5e332e1a8c6918d59
66f5c91a61b5e9ee7

This won't make it into the upcoming release (6.3) but it will be in the 
next one.

In the meantime, you may find it convenient to push the "dock" 
button on the test window, as that will remember the amount of 
space it has.

 Hi Robby,
 
 Thank you for addressing the issue so quickly and letting me know about the
 dock feature.
