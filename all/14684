>Description:
The second and third entries in the Community section of the main page
has a typo that look like some bug (or some consistent editing mistake):

    Discussion lists for using and developing Racke
    The Racket source code on GitHu

Note the missing last letter + ".".

Another picky-ness: the blog description ends with a "thoughtful rant"
and a "." is missing.
