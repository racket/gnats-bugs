>Description:
Textbook user Dahlia Gibson reported this to me.
More specifically, they both work correctly on (rotate 30 IMG) unless IMG is a bitmap, in which case they both produce the flip-horizontal of the right answer.  For flip-horizontal, that means doing nothing; for flip-vertical, that means actually doing a rotate-180.
This bug looks familiar: I thought this had been reported and fixed years ago.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/image)

(define s (overlay (overlay/align
                    "left" "bottom"
                    (overlay
                     (isosceles-triangle 40 20 "solid" "green")
                     (square 50 "solid" "blue"))
                    (rectangle 20 60 "solid" "blue"))
                   (square 72 "solid" "white")))

(define i (freeze s))

; ===========================================================

(text "  Image tree         Bitmap" 16 "black")

(define (stack pic)
  (above pic
         (rotate 30 pic)
         (flip-vertical (rotate 30 pic))))

(beside (stack s) (stack i))

"Bug: flip-vertical on a rotated bitmap actually performs rotate-180 instead."
