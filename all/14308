>Description:
Returning the wrong number of values from a chaperone of a struct field accessor or mutator will crash racket.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run the following code:

   (struct base (foo))

   (define x
     (chaperone-struct (base 42)
       base-foo
       (lambda (v field-v)
         (values field-v 'die))))

   (base-foo x)

2. Racket crashes with

   SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr 0x6

Note: this also crashes when chaperoning set-base-foo! instead.

 I can reproduce this crash on Racket v5.3, but it doesn't seem to occur
 on the latest development version v6.0.0.1.
 
 Can you try a pre-release build and see if it's fixed for you too?
 Pre-release builds are available here:

 Yes, this is fixed in the latest snapshot.
 
 Sorry I didn't think to check!

 Thanks for checking! I'll go ahead and close this PR then.
