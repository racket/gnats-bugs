 I think the '..' in (def._((lib._racket/private/map..rkt)
 Is a bit suspicious.
 
 But the /Applications/PLT-Racket/Racket
 v5.0.99.6/doc/reference/pairs.html is right on my system, as I put all
 my racket installs in /Applications/PLT-Racket/

 I hit f1 on ormap and I get a different url, but when I check syntax
 and then right click on an identifier with docs, I get this url:
 
 file:///Users/robby/git/exp/plt/doc/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fmap..rkt)._ormap))
 
 which looks a lot like yours, except the /s are escaped in mine.
 
 I have a version from Jan 31st under mac os x tho, so maybe a bug was
 fixed in interm 10 days?

 I wonder whether it's a difference between FireFox 3.x and the beta
 4.0, in case we need to be aware of a FF4 change. Do you know whether
 the same problem happens with FF3?

 It might be due to two things --
 
 1. The URL should have "/"s escaped after the "?", otherwise they
    might be taken as part of the path.  But copy/pasting the url from
    browsers is not reliable -- some of them will do a conversion in
    the process.  (For example, I see that documentation links get
    copied with "()"s but the url that gets used as them escaped.)
 
 2. Another possible problem is tightening security, and maybe
    forbidding local files with a query string and/or JS...  (This is
    one reason why the local documentation searches are nearly useless
    with IE.)  So perhaps FF4 changed something.

 For the record, my default browser was still Safari.

 I just downloaded FF4 under mac os x and did the same two tests: f1
 and check-syntax->click. I copy and paste and got these urls in the
 browser's bar and everything seems fine:
 
 file:///Users/robby/git/exp/plt/doc/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fmap..rkt%29._ormap%29%29
 
 file:///Users/robby/Library/Racket/5.1.0.2/doc/search/index.html?q=ormap
 
 Note, tho, that the first url has ()s in it when I see it in the
 address bar, but when I copied and pasted it, they got escaped. Not
 sure why that is.
 
 Perhaps there are some preferences one can set or something that end
 up disabling things?
