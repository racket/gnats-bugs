>Description:
The following REPL interaction seems unproblematic:

Welcome to Racket v6.1.0.3.
-> (require games/cards)
-> (make-card 0 1 2 3)
(object:card% ...)

Even though the arguments are clearly invalid since 0 is not a bitmap%, but there is no error generated.

In DrRacket, however running the following program in the definitions window causes problems.

#lang racket
(require games/cards)
(make-card 0 1 2 3)

Brings up a dialogue window labelled: "DrRacket Internal Error" with the following error message

draw-bitmap: contract violation
  expected: (is-a?/c bitmap%)
  given: 1
  in: the 1st argument of
      (->*m
       ((is-a?/c bitmap%) real? real?)
       ((or/c 'solid 'opaque 'xor)
        (is-a?/c color%)
        (or/c (is-a?/c bitmap%) #f))
       boolean?)
  contract from: (class dc%)
  blaming: <pkgs>/gui-lib/mred/private/wx/cocoa/canvas.rkt
   (assuming the contract is correct)

Then the program seems to lock up in the middle of trying to evaluate the definitions. Trying to stop execution via the "Stop" button fails whether clicking "Just Break" or "Kill". Occasionally DrRacket becomes totally unresponsive and I need to force quit the program to exit DrRacket. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following program into the definitions window of DrRacket and run.

#lang racket
(require games/cards)
(make-card 0 1 2 3)

 DrRacket Internal Error

 FWIW, this is a well-known problem with DrRacket. It trusts any snips
 that the program returns to not signal errors when they are drawn.
 
 It shouldn't do that, but we want to display certain snips as fancy
 values that we should trust.
 
 This has been on my list to fix for a  long time, but for now I just
 have to say "don't do that" (where this particular program should
 probably be fixed with a contract on make-card).
 
 If you're experimenting with snips that may be broken (because you're
 building a new kind of snip), then put them in a window instead of
 returning at the REPL as a way to work around this shortcoming in
 DrRacket.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 17 Jul 2014 01:49:46 -0400
Reason>>> 
I'm going to treat commit d4b97dcca as closing this, even tho it only affects 
part of the issue.
