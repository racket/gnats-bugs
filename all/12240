>Description:
The included program causes the following error:
fl->fx: expects argument of type <flonum integer>; given #<variable-code>

The error only occurs if the numeric operations are in a lambda.

If unsafe operations are used, this program (and many variations) gives the right answer.

Printing the result of fl/ directly gives the right answer.

Removing some of the operations makes the problem go away.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base
(require racket/flonum
         racket/fixnum)

(for-each (lambda (x) (display (fl->fx (fl/ (fl- x 0.0) 1.0))))
          '(1.0))
