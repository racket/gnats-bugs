Computer Language: (("Determine language from source") (#(#t print mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug/profile) (default) #() "#lang racket\n" #f #t ((test) (main)) #t))
>Description:
I would expect:

#lang typed/racket
(let loop ([x (list 1 2)]) 
  (cond [(null? (cddr x)) #t]
        [else #f]))

to produce #t, however it errors with:

../../Applications/Racket/racket/share/pkgs/typed-racket-lib/typed-racket/typecheck/tc-expr-unit.rkt:68:0: free-identifier=?: contract violation
  expected: identifier?
  given: #<syntax:3:16 (#%app cddr x)>
  argument position: 2nd
  other arguments.:

cond and let function fine on their own, as does this code without the `loop`.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(let loop ([x (list 1 2)]) 
  (cond [(null? (cddr x)) #t]
        [else #f]))

 In addition, I just noticed using empty? instead of null? also fixed the
 problem.
