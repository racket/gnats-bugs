>Description:
The implementation of free/bound idtables is split up into two libraries  one that uses contracts and one that does not. I assumed that this was so that the contract libraries and lower level things could use them. This is now no longer true because of the dependency on the generic library. I think the generic library should split off its contract forms so that the other forms are useable below contracts.
