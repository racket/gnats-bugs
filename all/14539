As you can see, the indentation is really odd. I would expect better output since
the macro above seems pretty straightforward.

 The `racketblock` in the expansion of `deeform*` sees a "(" at line 4
 column 14 followed by an `foo` identifier at line 9 column 9, so it
 think that 5 newlines are needed to typeset using the original source
 locations, while it gives up on negative horizontal space. Then,
 there's a an identifier `id` at line 4 column 20; negative vertical
 space (line 9 back to line 4) is ignored, but 8 blanks are produced to
 get from column 9 + 3 characters to column 20. And so on.
 
 I can imagine more complicated rules that `racketblock` could follow to
 make this case work out better, but I think it's not obvious what to do
 in general, and hopefully that explains what's going on.

 And just in case it wasn't obvious, you can manufacture source
 locations for the macro arguments to construct the "right thing" to
 hand to scribble using datum->syntax to make this macro work in the
 way you want, I believe.

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/14539: scribble: bad indentation in macro-generated defform
Date: Tue, 3 Jun 2014 17:27:42 -0400

 I have run into this problem before, and others will too. 
 
 I figured out I should be able to manufacture source locations to trick scribble. 
 And then I gave up. Too much work for what I wanted. 
 
 While I understand Matthew's doubts about being to do better, 
 I am not sure that asking the programmer to work harder for 
 this obvious wish is a good thing (tm).

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/14539: scribble: bad indentation in
 macro-generated defform
Date: Tue, 3 Jun 2014 18:45:42 -0500

 Well, _some_ programmer has to work harder here. :)
 
 In all seriousness, it isn't clear how to do this in the general case.
 But I feel like this specific case is one that the author of the
 def-foo is in a position to fix but that the author of the defform
 macro is not in a position to fix (the necc information isn't there
 ... I think?).

 I agree, because in this case I'd rather just duplicate the code than
 write a tricky macro that is harder to maintain later. So it's too bad
 that this doesn't work.
 
 That said, thanks to Matthew and Robby I think I understand why there
 isn't an obvious fix on the library side. Maybe there could be a mode
 that ignores the syntax locations and just pretty prints the datum or
 something?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 I wonder if there could be a variant of with-syntax that somehow picks
 up the source location of the place just around where a substitution
 happens and then that would make this macro easy to write?
