>Description:
I installed Minimal Racket on Windows and then tried to install
DrRacket via raco.exe. It appears that the launcher failed to
build for DrRacket and I get the following error message:

raco setup: error: during Launcher Setup for <pkgs>/drracket/drracket
raco setup:   C:\Users\asumu\AppData\Roaming\Racket\snapshot\lib\extreg.rktd::103: read: bad syntax `#<'

The contents of the file mentioned in the error is as follows:

#hash(("DrRacket.exe" . (("Racket Document" "Racket.Document" ("rkt" "rktl" "rktd" "ss" "scm" "scrbl") #<path:C:\Users\asumu\AppData\Roaming\Racket\snapshot\pkgs\drracket\drracket\doc.ico> "\"%1\""))))
