>Description:
The example in the docs for in-producer is an invalid sequence, as in you get an error if you apply any sequence functions to it. Yet, if you give the same sequence to for, everything magically works, as demonstrated in the docs.

> (define (counter)
    (define n 0)
    (lambda ([d 1]) (set! n (+ d n)) n))
> (sequence-ref (in-producer (counter)) 10)
. . +: contract violation

  | fix use of in-producer outside of for loops

  | - make-do-sequence was giving producer fn an argument when none was expected

  | Closes PR 13986
