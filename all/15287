>Description:
DrRacket crashes, or sometimes segfaults or runs out of virtual memory when running one of my projects. (Even though the memory limit is set at 128MB).

running the same line wich invokes the crash in racket on the commandline (even multiple times) doesn't result in this error.

I usually update to the latest snapshot every 2-4 weeks.  I've been noticing an increase in crashes since about the beginning of march.  But this is the first time since then that i needed this project, and this project keeps crashing more or less consistently (This morning I was still running ?6.4.14? and had the same problems, going to 6.5.0.2 didn't help)
>How-To-Repeat:
run the main module of PIAS/plugins/pd0reader.rkt.  I'll included the input file in the same folder.
(I'll try to upload a zip of my code.  Feel free to email for more info)

 The "hlpfun/csv-io.rkt" module refers to a file "atomic.rkt" that isn't
 present. Was that file meant to be in the archive, or is it meant to be
 from somewhere else?
 
 Thanks!

 it was meant to also be present in hlpfun.
 
 I noticed that the size of the external file (pd0) I read has an impact, if=
  I reduce it to around 2MB (instead of 26MB) crashes usually occur every 5t=
 h run.  It also feels like editing the main file (in DrRacket) during a run=
  makes the problem worse.
 The segfaults are gc segfaults.
 
 Thanks for looking into this.
 If you need more info or if I can help in another way.  let me know.
 
 Bert
 
 PS.  Sorry for dumping all these files as is, but due to the segfault I don=
 't have a clear idea of how to look for the mistake and trim the example.
 Also, these are files that grew over the last 5 years while learning racket=
  so pardon for bad documentation and dumb ways of doing things.  I hope I'm=
  getting better...

 Thanks --- that's helpful info. Editing the program triggers two
 relevant behaviors: it restarts background expansion, and it puts the
 main task into incremental-GC mode.
 
 Still, when I do things like that, it seems to work as it should. I'm
 seeing peak memory use right around 900MB, which isn't into the danger
 range. There might be an extra ingredient that I'm missing.
 
 
 What if you start DrRacket with
 
  racket -W "debug@GC error" -l- drracket
 
 and also watch "Peak working set" in Task Manager? What kinds of
 numbers do you see in the command-prompt window and in Task Manager?
 
 (To get "Peak working size", you'll probably have to add that one to
 the list of columns to show. I forget how; maybe it's by right-clicking
 in the column area.)
 
 
 Meanwhile, are you particularly interested in running 32-bit DrRacket,
 as opposed to 64-bit? I imagine that switching to 64-bit DrRacket would
 make the problem go away, unless your machine is particularly
 memory-constrained.

 I got "Peak memory set" confused with "Commit size", which is more
 relevant. And now that I see that the commit size was still growing ---
 up to 1.4 GB before a GC triggered a reset back down to 600 MB.
 
 The commit size grows because the GC uses more and more "adminsirative"
 memory relative to allocated memory. That pattern, in turn, is almost
 certainly related to incremental GC. I'll keep investigating.

 Hallo,
 
 last line from the terminal: (on my win10 64bit laptop)
 
 GC: 0:mIn @ 353,597(+646,899)[+32,504K]; free 8,632K(-1.784K) 0ms @ 367687
 
 Task manager @ time of crash
 peak working: 881.540K  Commit: 1.359.404K
 
 (this was with today's snapshot)
 I also tried running todays snapshot freshly installed (so not on my portable disk) with similar results
 
 This time I didn't touch anything in the editing pane.  Just opened the file and started running it.  What I tried to say was that when editing, it seems to crash faster, but maybe that's just because then I'm busy.
 
 I also tried the same program using the 64bit version both on my win10 laptop and on my linux desktop and luckely was unable to reproduce the crash.
 I noticed that on Linux my VM-use went up to 2.6G and RES up to 1.8G
 On windows similar albeit slightly lower values.
 
 Running 32bit is legacy from when I was using my portable apps more on different computers of which at least a few where 32bit.  Looks like it's time to change.

 Thanks! I've pushed an change to the GC that's aimed at avoiding the
 646MB overhead that you see in that output.
 
 Your program apparently goes through a phase that interacts badly with
 incremental collection, leading to fragmentation. You'd only see that
 effect in DrRacket, not through plain `Racket`; incremental mode is off
 by default, and DrRacket requests it in reaction to GUI events (to
 avoid pauses while you're trying to use the editor). A related issue is
 that the fragmentation problem is biggest on 32-bit Windows, because
 the ratio between an object size and the granularity of page allocation
 on 32-bit Windows is at least twice as large as for any other platform.
 
 The GC now detects the mismatch between the allocation workload and
 incremental mode, and it adjusts by forcing a non-incremental
 collection to bring things back in line.
