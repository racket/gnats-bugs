>Description:
The choices for a combo-field% do not show when the combo-field%'s drop down arrow is clicked. Instead a small empty container is shown. 

The program below works ok with 5.3.0.21 but fails with 5.3.0.24 and 5.3.1.1. 
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define frame (new frame% 
                   [label "test combo-field"] 
                   [width 400] 
                   [height 200]
                   ))

(define combo-field1 (new combo-field% 
                          [parent frame] 
                          [label "combo-field%"] 
                          [choices (list "alpha" "bravo" "charlie")]
                          [stretchable-width #f] 
                          [stretchable-height #f]
                          ))
