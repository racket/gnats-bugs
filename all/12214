>Description:
I cannot get Dr Dracket v 5.1.3 to install on Ubuntu 11.04; i'm pretty new at Ubuntu so i might be doing something wrong but I could not get the default text editor to open the file and the commands

sh filename.sh and
sudo bash filename.sh 

would not open the file either
>How-To-Repeat:
I originally attempted to open the file with the default text editor but it could not even open the file.

So then i tried to enter the command sh filename.sh into the terminal and it gave me the error 

sh cannot open the filename.sh

So next i attempted to enter the command sudo bash filename.sh which gave me the error

sudo bash cannot open the filename.sh
