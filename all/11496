>Description:
The string representation "0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001", which might conceivably be generated by some program whose output a Racketeer might want to parse, is equivalent to "1e-133". Racket reads "1e-133" correctly, but reads the other string as 0.0.

Racket has no difficulty reading "10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0" as 1e+133, so one would expect the same correctness when reading its reciprocal.
