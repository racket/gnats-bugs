 That's coming from "read", fwiw.

 I'll look into changing "read-number" to "read".

 so it's not the choice of example, but I see you're in the nightly build.

 I understand it's coming from read. What I am surprised about is that =

 What do you mean by "expression"?  Not every value produced by `read`
 is passed to `eval`.  If someone writes 1/0, it certainly shouldn't
 read back as something involving cons cells.  Rational number literals
 are not reader macros for division expressions.

 It was fixed -- it used to "hang" on every reader error, and now it
 just signals the error.

 +1 -- I wouldn't want (car '1/0) to return '/ (or for '1/0 to be
 different than 1/0)...

 Technically, when you hit return, drracket uses read and if read
 raises an eof exception then it will insert the newline and wait for
 more input (ie "hang") but any other exception from read (or a
 successful result) means that it will take this as a complete
 expression and submit it to the REPL and whatever happens after that
 happens (ie, it gets read/evaluated/errors signaled/whatever).
