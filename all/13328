>Description:
After passing a project through raco exe and raco distribute, I get the following output right after invoking the resulting executable:

standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found
  collection: "racket/match"
  in collection directories:
   C:\_GitRepos\Kanjiget\win\out\lib\plt\kanjiget\collects
  context...:
   standard-module-name-resolver
   #%embedded:g3796:wiktionaryviewer: [running body]
   #%mzc:kanjiget: [traversing imports]
   loop


The project runs fine in DrRacket and from racket CLI and the issue is reproducible on two different computers (both Windows). Another of my projects does result in working executables so it looks to be some sort of corner case. I have the redirected output from raco make/exe/distribute and the project's source code is available online for error reproduction if that helps.

Thank you for your time!

Steps:
1. git clone repo
2. cd win
3. make.bat
4. the resulting exe is in "out" subfolder

 Hi Edward,
 
 
 Ok, I'll investigate this....  out of curiosity, do you know if you do
 any dynamic module loading in the project?
 
 
 ... ok, I've been able to find some information.  It's possible that
 the underlying error for this has been repaired, as I see references
 to this problem on the developer list with regards to 5.3.1, with some
 mitigation for the issue:
 
     http://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2012-November/054847.html
 
 
 If you are still stuck on Racket 5.3.1, please try adding this to your project:
 
     (require (for-syntax racket/match/parse))
 
 as the workaround for this bug.
 
 
 If you can use Racket 5.3.3, it would be very helpful to know if 5.3.3
 has corrected this problem.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by dyoo at Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:30:04 -0500
Reason>>> Appears to be the regression to lazy-require discovered in Racket 5.3.1  
(949d12e2c6).   Awaiting feedback before closing this bug report, as it should 
be fixed in 5.3.3.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by dyoo at Tue, 05 Mar 2013 00:46:22 -0500
Reason>>> Followed up with Edward Blake, who in private email confirms that he doesn't see 
the issue in 5.3.3 anymore.
