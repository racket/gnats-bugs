>Description:
Scrolling is slow and lags causing it to be difficult to scroll to the correct place with the trackpad.

I'm pretty sure this issue is not limited to just OSX. It's just most noticeable to me on a laptop with a trackpad. Scroll wheels are not as bad.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket, type enough code so as to have a need for scrolling, attempt scrolling.
>Fix:
