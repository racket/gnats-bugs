>Description:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/sgl/overview.html
this page says to try collects/sgl/examples/alpha.rkt.  i tried in after compiling the latest stable, and after installing racket through the ubuntu ppa here: https://launchpad.net/~plt/+archive/racket

either way i get a black screen that doesn't close when i click the x.  no error messages in the terminal that started drracket either.
>How-To-Repeat:
0. start drracket
1. file -> open -> alpha.rkt
2. click "run" with the green arrow
3. find sk.jpg in collects/icons
4. window separate from drracket shows up with solid black contents, titled "OpenGL Window"
5. can't close this window except by closing drracket completely.

 What happens if you start the program directly on the command line
 with 'racket alpha.rkt'?

 When we discussed this on IRC, I tried running it from the command line
 with the same results. However, it did work once I sent it an interrupt
 with ctrl+c (black window until then).
