Hello, I have been trying to use the function string-split and regexp-split, and it doesn't work, I have tried changing every language (although I am using Beginning Student with List Abbreviations). I don't know if it used to work in previous versions, but in 6.5 I can't make it work, I tested with a friend in Ubuntu too, still, doesn't work. Thanks for your help :)

 I donâ€™t think string-split was ever defined in BSL or ISL. But what does work (and always has) is to import racket/string like thus: 
 
 #lang htdp/bsl+
 (require racket/string)
 (string-split "hello" "l")
