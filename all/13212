The sha1 function in file/sha1 appears to leave off leading zero characters from results.

Thanks to jonrafkind on #racket for confirmation, a work-around, suggesting reporting a bug, and providing a relevant URL to do so :)

FWIW, the suggested work-around was to use:

  (bytes->hex-string (sha1-bytes in))
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Download portable Racket 5.3: https://bitbucket.org/chust/racket-portable/downloads/RacketPortable_5.3.paf.exe

2. Install to C:\apps\RacketPortable

3. Calculate SHA1 hash (e.g. using HashMyFiles) of a file containing the single character
   for 6 (call it sample.txt, say) to find:

     08e5ba8ab2c17ed0eb5cdd45c51f7391ea6190ff

4. Use Racket's SHA1 capability (sha1 from file/sha1) to find:

     8e5ba8ab2c17ed0eb5cdd45c51f7391ea6190ff

#lang racket

(require file/sha1)

(call-with-input-file "sample.txt"
    (lambda (in)
      (let ([computed (sha1 in)])
        (display (string-append "Result: " computed "\n"))
        (display (string-append "Length: " (number->string (string-length computed)) "\n")))))

Note that the resulting string has length 39 and not 40 -- a leading zero appears to be 
missing.  IIUC, the SHA1 hash of plt-r5rs.exe should have 2 leading zeros, but Racket's
sha1 leaves the 2 leading zeros off.

 I agree.  Sending a patch over to be pulled at:
 https://github.com/plt/racket/pull/165 that just does the suggested
 workaround by Jon Rafkind.
