>Description:
I thought that a student in my class is hopelessly lost since he was talking about a
"binding quote" -- and then he told me that this is how DrR calls it when you hover
the mouse over it.  I then saw that the tooltip always says "binding foo imported..."
without any quotes or font/color change to indicate that `foo` is an identifier name.
This can result in some very confusing tooltips, including "natural language injection
attacks" like "binding not imported from racket".

A nice visual connection can be done by using the same bg color that the hovered
identifier gets, to show how they're connected.  But an easy fix is to add quotes or
even drop the name (since it's highlighted anyway).

 FWIW, I wouldn’t have added quotes around the names. Dropping the name completely as Eli suggested would probably make a fine tooltip.
