Computer Language: (("Teaching Languages" "How to Design Programs" "Intermediate Student") (#(#t constructor repeating-decimal #f #t none) #f () #f))
>Description:
I started up Dr.Racket and it gave me an error message that a language wasn't chosen. I opened a file before setting the language the the intermediate student. When I opened the file, it was wiped clear except the first line had 45226 characters in it (CLRF 1:45226) and there are no other lines. This version was autosaved and then Dr.Racket crashed and now I can't restore the past version of my code.
