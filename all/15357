After adding the latest version of Racket to the Applications folder, it will not open. The following message pops up when I try to open GRacket: "GRacket cannot be opened because of a problem. Check with the developer to make sure GRacket works with this version of macOS. You may need to reinstall the application. Be sure to install any available updates for the application and macOS."

 I have not yet had a chance to track down the problem. As a workaround
 for now, starting from the command line works for me. 
 
 For example:
  
   /Applications/Racket\ v6.6/bin/drracket &
 
 in Terminal starts DrRacket v6.6 when it's installed in the usual
 place (i.e., in the "Applications" folder).

 We finally tracked the problem down to Sierra's new path randomization.
 We've updated the ".dmg" for the distribution so that it's signed (in
 addition to signing the executables in the distribution), and that
 should fix the problem for installation on Sierra.
