>Description:
If I try the following interaction the following happens:

========
c:\Program Files\Racket>raco pkg install sxml
raco pkg install sxml
The following packages are listed as dependencies, but are not currently installed:
	base srfi-lib 
Would you like to install them via your package indices? [Yn] Y
Invalid input: "Y\r"
========

I couldn't find a way to make it accept the y. I tried at first from a shell running inside Emacs, and then from a normal shell window.

Cheers

 As a followup, I attach the transcript of what happens if I try:
 
 raco pkg install base
 raco pkg install srfi-lib
 
 which I don't know if it is as it is supposed to be.
 
 Cheers

 Thanks for the bug report! I think this is a duplicate of PR 14032:
   http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view%20audit-trail&database=default&pr=14032
 
 Cheers,
