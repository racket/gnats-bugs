>Description:
The following program produces a very strange type error:

#lang typed/racket
(string-join '("hello" "world") " ")



I see the following errors at compile-time:

. Type Checker: Wrong number of arguments, expected 2 and got 9 in: (string-join (quote ("hello" "world")) " ")
. Type Checker: Expected (Listof String), but got False in: (string-join (quote ("hello" "world")) " ")
. Type Checker: Expected String, but got False in: (string-join (quote ("hello" "world")) " ")
. Type Checker: Summary: 3 errors encountered in:
  (string-join (quote ("hello" "world")) " ")
  (string-join (quote ("hello" "world")) " ")
  (string-join (quote ("hello" "world")) " ")
