>Description:
Installing a .plt via URL brings my machine to its knees (DrRacket seems to be in a loop; response time becomes huge (>10sec and slower), and memory usage creeps up).

It works okay if I download the .plt manually and then install from file.  It also works for me on v5.3.6.
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrRacket:
(a) File > Install .plt File...
(b) in Web > URL, I entered: http://pyret.org/download/pyret-0.2.plt
