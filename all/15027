 This problem seems to go away if you run `raco setup` again. You can
 make it reappear with:
 
 $ raco planet remove lizorkin sxml.plt 2 1
 $ raco setup iloveck101
 
 However, just creating a simple collection that requires that planet
 package doesn't reproduce the error.

 This appears to be because that package requires a planet package and
 is not otherwise specific to that package. I'm not sure what is going
 on, but perhaps a namespace isn't being set up properly during pkg
 installation somehow?

 Lots of other packages that I've tried sucessfully install planet
 packages, so there's almost certainly something odd going on here, but
 it's hard to tell what so far for me. I spent some time trying to
 reproduce this simpler ways, and couldn't manage to.

 Ah, thanks.
 
 The error message says to me "the planet resovler was started in a
 namespace that's set up strangely". I'm not 100% confident of that
 interpretation but I'm also not sure how to proceed. I don't see
 anything in the implementation of the package that's doing something
 special wrt to namespaces or planet.
 
 I can try looking into this later when my stack gets shorter but I
 don't have the time right now. Sorry.
