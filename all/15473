 We changed how this works (because of the error you get in 6.9, which
 is a bug in osascript or somewhere else in the OS, as far as we can
 tell). So I think that this is probably more of the same.
 
 It might work if you set your OS-level preferences back to Safari for
 the default browser.
 
 If you have energy to play around with the code and try to find
 another work-around for the work-around, the code is here:
 
    https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/master/pkgs/net-lib/net/sendurl.rkt#L171
 
 It seems like it should be possible to tell the OS that you want
 *this* google chrome, not *that* google chrome, tho. Somehow.

 Hi Robby,
 
 FWIW I couldnâ€™t figure anything useful out in a short order of time..  I discovered a copy of Google Chrome for Parallels hiding in some very random corner of my computer and made it go away, so now things work fine.  I have no idea why my OS was finding that application first.
 
 Thanks for your help!
 Ron
