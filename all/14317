>Description:
Going to pkg.r-l.o (eg, from the front page link) leads two location
tweaking that is user-visible.  Currently, trying it in Chrome, after
a click on "packages" I need *three* backward steps to get back to the
main site.

IIRC, there should be a way to tweak the location in a way that doesn't
register it in the history sequence, but I think that it's more
important to consider the meaning of URLs.  If the intention is that
the main page will always showing whatever it is that it shows now,
then this should just be the default that gets displayed when there is
no fragment in the URL (no #-part).  But if it might show something
else but the link from r-l.o should show what it does now, then that
link should change and point at http://pkg.../#(!...)(!...).  Either
of these will make the question of how to better do the location
tweaking redundant.
