 That's puzzling. I've pushed improvements to checking and reporting in
 `raco decompile`, and hopefully that will help us see the problem.

Date: Mon, 26 May 2014 23:42:36 -0700

 Very informative error message.
 
 raco decompile: not a bytecode file, and no associated ".zo" file
   path: /Users/endobson/tmp/tmp.rkt
   tried associated path: /Users/endobson/tmp/compiled/tmp_rkt.zo
 
 Thats not the path that it should be looking in as I have set PLTCOMPILEDROOTS
 From my env:
 PLTCOMPILEDROOTS=/Users/endobson/proj/racket/compile-root/@(version)/
