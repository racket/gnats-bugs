>Description:
If we try to (serialize) a serializable struct defined in a submodule, the submodule's serialized module path may contain an unreadable #<path:...> value that cannot be deserialized.

(As an aside, it's counterintuitive that (deserialize) would run the `main` submodule, but I see why it has to require it to extract the serialization info)
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following to /tmp/test.rkt:

(require racket/serialize)
(module+ main
   (serializable-struct foo (bar))
   (serialize (foo 35)))

For me, this prints:

'((3)
  1
  (((submod #<path:/tmp/test.rkt> main) . deserialize-info:foo-v0))
  0
  ()
  ()
  (0 35))

But (read) cannot read #<path:...> values.
