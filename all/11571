>Description:
I think the program below should produce true, but it doesn't.

A related program is to replace the two calls to set-argb-pixels with these two lines and then the program produces #t.

(send bm1 set-argb-pixels 0 0 1 2 (bytes 0   0 0 0
                                         255 0 0 255))
(send bm2 set-argb-pixels 0 0 1 2 (bytes 255 255 0 0
                                         0   0   0 0))

I think that this means that the handling for alpha=0 colors isn't quite right (unless I've gotten something backwards...)
