>Description:
In the documentation for GUI Windowing Functions , the 'common option for the style argument in get-file, put-file, and get-directory is not listed in the function specification.  It is mentioned in the text for get-file and get-directory (and thus put-file indirectly).  There is no list of permitted style options for get-file-list in the function specification.
