>Description:
Hello,

Since I have a bad sight, I changed the text size option of my display, and several DrRacket form display are messed up.
It seems the control size is fixed, while the text rendered inside the controls follow the size option set in windows.
I guess someone who already knows DrRacket can still use it but for a first use it really makes a bad experience.

Regards,
Benoît
>How-To-Repeat:
 - In windows control panel goto "Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Display".
 - Change the text size to something significantly bigger that 100% (125% for example).
 - Install and run Dr Racket.
 - Hit the bottom left menu button
 - Select "Choose Language"
 - In the "Choose Language" dialog, hit the "Show Details" button
 - The form on the right is barely usable.
