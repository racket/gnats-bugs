>Description:
I'm running DrRacket on Ubuntu 12.04. I build from source (pulled from Git) and have experienced this bug on sevearl versions of DrRacket.  

DrRacket will frequently (perhaps all of the time) freeze upon the first save of a new document IF that document is being saved to a FAT32 partition.  I have not experienced the freeze when saving to an Ext4 partition.  Basically, I was trying to keep my source code on a partition shared between Ubuntu and Windows 7.  The initial save of a new source document would cause DrRacket to freeze and I'd have to force close. The file is almost always saved and can be opened by DrRacket.  Subsequent saves do not seem to cause the Freeze
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Load DrRacket (Linux). Create a new File.
2) Save that file to a FAT Partition.
3) DrRacket should Freeze and Require force closing. File save will be sucessful.
4) File can then be opened by a new DrRacket session and edited/saved without problem
