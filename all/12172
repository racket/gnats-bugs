State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 05 Sep 2011 09:39:34 -0400
Reason>>> Thanks for the report. I've looked into it a little bit and
I'm unable to see how it happens from the source inspection.
Also, part of the message in that box got erased somehow, so
there's a little bit of guesswork on my part.

Anyways, thank you very much for the bug and I'll keep my
eyes open, but I'm going to close this report. If you want
to re-open it if it happens again, please feel free to let
me know.

Thanks,
Robby
