>Description:
Accessing the .../quit URL of a web servlet application doesn't actually work if the http connection is immediately broken. See experiment and analysis below.

EXPERIMENT:

Start up a servlet so:
   (serve/servlet my-dispatch #:quit? #t ...)
 Now, how come if I use a program like curl/wget to access the "/quit" URL, the server doesn't shut down, but accessing the same URL via a web browser does? Here's the terminal interaction with curl:

$ curl http://localhost:8000/quit
<html><head><title>Server Stopped</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="/error.css" /></head><body><div class="section"><div class="title">Server Stopped</div><p>Return to DrRacket.</p></div></body></html>

... The server continues running. Now if I visit the same url in a browser, it stops after displaying the same HTML above. Here's the log file for the servlet (the two requests look identical):

127.0.0.1 - - [23/Jun/2010:15:25:29 -0400] "GET /quit HTTP/1.1" 200 512
127.0.0.1 - - [23/Jun/2010:15:25:37 -0400] "GET /quit HTTP/1.1" 200 512


ANALYSIS:

I think I found it... in servlet-env.rkt, the "quit-server" function starts a thread that sleeps two seconds (sleep 2) before incrementing the semaphore. If you remove the delay, or make it (sleep 0), then curl'ing the /quit URL shuts down the server. So I think the problem is something to do with whether the connection to the server remains open 2 seconds or more; if it is closed before that, then perhaps all threads related to the request are killed, including this one that is in the middle of its delay, so the semaphore is never changed. You can see this happen if you make the request in the web browser to the /quit url and then quickly close the window before 2 seconds is up, apparently.
