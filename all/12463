>Description:
In section 16.2.3 of the Racket Guide (http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/with-syntax.html)

In the paragraph:

Now we need an expression in place of .... that generates as many identifiers as there are id matches in the original pattern. Since this is a common task, Racket provides a helper function, generate-temporaries, that takes a sequece of identifiers and returns a sequence of generated identifiers:

"sequece" is a typo.
