>Description:
Hi!
I think the example found in the URL below should not just define a struct "alist" but also use it like so:

(define d1 (alist '((1 . a) (2 . b))))

https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/a3a55de00a8443297845e92834d12f4d828f758a/collects/scribblings/reference/dicts.scrbl#L589

Is my understanding right?

Also note that the generated code appears in HTML as:
======
...
           (length (remove-duplicates (alist-v dict) #:key car))))
     ; etc. other methods])
======

This last line comments out the closing brackets, not good :(
