Hi guys.

I'm writing you because of one situation i found in your documentation, i'm completely new in racket, i programmed before in other languages as basic, java, assembly, and i enjoy search and take a try in new programming languages, so i found your's, the problem is that i regularly follow the manual to understand the language and the one you give in your site seems to be from a diferent version of the program, because the commands circle and rectangle don't run giving the parameters the manual gives, we need to define outline or solid and then the color, the manual don't refer it. other question in manual you have the command hc-append, i tried to use it, but it doesn't exist in the new version of the program.

Did u implement a new one to do the same of hc-append??

Best regards

 Did you add 
 
  (require slideshow) 
 
 as in 
 
 #lang racket
 
 (require slideshow)
 
 (hc-append (circle 30) (rectangle 200 40))
 
 [[ I thought the docs said so. ]]

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Sat, 24 Jun 2017 12:53:27 -0400
Reason>>> The author reported to follow Quick. I followed the instructions (in Ready/Set) and 
copied the expressions from GO to the Interactions area in DrRacket. It all worked 
as expected.
