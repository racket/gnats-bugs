>Description:
In DrRacket, the error message indicating a required file is not found, does not get cleared immediately after the file is created.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket, open new tab (e.g. with just #lang racket), save as file-1.rkt.
Add require to non-existant file (require "file-2.rkt").
Observe error message: default-load-handler: cannot open input file path: file-2.rkt system error: The system cannot find the file specified.; errno=2
Open another tab (e.g. with just #lang racket), save as file-2.rkt (in same directory as file-1). Navigate to first tab. Edit file (e.g. add expression (+ 1 1)), save file. 
Observe error message not removed even though file has been recompiled (with zero errors).

 Where is the error message? In the bar along the bottom where the
 "background" (formerly "online") messages appear?

 Yes - the same area where syntax error check status and error messages show.

 Also, in DrRacket, the error message when trying to use old versions of
 compiled code (see example message below) does not get cleared after a
 re-compile (in another command window) and a successful racket->run
 (ctrl-r).

 Hitting "run" doesn't re-trigger online check syntax running; you must
 edit the buffer for that to happen.
 
 I tried the steps to reproduce in the original PR just now and I'm not
 seeing this problem (neither in the git head version, nor in 5.3.1).
 
 Do you still see this problem?

 I also cannot now reproduce the original PR: with the first edit to file-1
 after file-2 is created, the "file not found" error message is cleared with
 "background expansion" messages and does not reappear.
 
 However I do still see the "read (compiled): wrong version for compiled
 code" error message after a successful run, after first compiling with raco
 make in another window. In the spirit of "no information is better than
 wrong information", perhaps hitting run could clear the status of the
 online checker such that when focus returns to the definitions window, the
 online check resumes with a clean slate.

 (a59df8c/a)<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *** Description:<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In DrRacket, the error message indicating a required file=
  is not found,<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; does not get cleared immediately after the file is create=
 d.<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *** How to repeat:<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Start DrRacket, open new tab (e.g. with just #lang racket=
 ), save as<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; file-1.rkt.<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Add require to non-existant file (require &quot;file-2.rk=
 t&quot;).<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Observe error message: default-load-handler: cannot open =
 input file<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; path: file-2.rkt system error: The system cannot find the=
  file specified.;<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; errno=3D2<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Open another tab (e.g. with just #lang racket), save as f=
 ile-2.rkt (in<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same directory as file-1). Navigate to first tab. Edit fi=
 le (e.g. add<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; expression (+ 1 1)), save file.<br>
 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Observe error message not removed even though file has be=
 en recompiled<br>

 Sorry for the delayed response here.
 
 I think a better thing would be to figure out why the online compilation is
 getting a different result than 'run' gets in this case.
 
 If you can still reconstruct them, do you mind sending some instruction on
 how I can get the "wrong" answers from online compilation?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 The online check is not getting a different result. As you stated earlier
 the online check is only triggered by an edit in the file. But, when an
 error condition is cleared by editing (or creating) a second file and then
 coming back to the first, the (now incorrect) error remains visible (as
 would be expected). My point is that a Run in the first file should clear
 (update?) the error display, since now a non-online check has been executed
 and the old online check information is stale. It is confusing to see an
 error displayed even though Run was successful. In this case it should not
 be necessary to have to edit the file to clear the error.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Kieron.

 Since then, I pushed a change to online check syntax so it notices when you
 save a file that another depends on and it recompiles the other one. So if
 you are editing in drracket this should now work right.
 
 Are there other situations you've encountered?
