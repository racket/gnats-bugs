>Description:
filesystem-change-events do not document their behavior after  becoming ready for synchronization.

I assumed that it would be ready for synchronization once, and then I could resync on the same event to wait for future changes but it seems like that is not true, and it is ready forever after one change.

Also because of this behavior it seems like internally it could free the OS resources after being triggered, and the user would not have to manually cancel it. But there is no docs on this.
