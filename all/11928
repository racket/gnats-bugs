>Description:
The following program is expanded incorrectly. It ends up with a program which outputs #f, when it should do nothing. Looking at the macro expansion it looks like the (number? "1") is kept for possible side effects even though its value is known. But because of how 'top-level' expressions work in modules its value is printed.

 This fix seems to just cover the symptoms of the bug, by wrapping the expression in void so that the printer of the default module-begin doesn't do anything. Wouldn't a better fix be to wrap the begin in a #%expression, so that just the sequencing is maintained?

 Fixed. I'll push once I run the tests.
 
 Thanks,
