 (var id) is a match pattern that matches anything to `id'.

 Yes, I was about to add that maybe (var id) should be removed from match. I've only seen it cause problems, but maybe someone has a legitimate use for it.

 Can't match use standard binding behavior to implement the compiler? `var' could be a literal bound in racket/match while `list' can just be the standard one from racket/base. Then users can shadow them as they see fit.

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/13320: match fails on struct with one field
Date: Wed, 28 Nov 2012 16:46:11 -0800

 `match` currently matches the built-in pattern forms by symbol, which
 may have been a bad idea, but would break things to change.
 
 As an example, Eli's course language provides a distinct binding for
 `cons` (and many other bindings), but uses `match`, and thus would
 need to write lots of match expanders.  That's why I haven't made the
 change to use bindings everywhere.
 
 For `var`, I think we should just kill it.

 > Can't match use standard binding behavior to implement the compiler? `var' could be a literal bound in racket/match while `list' can just be the standard one from racket/base. Then users can shadow them as they see fit.
