>Description:
This program instantiates poly dots with Nothing instead of String when inferring a function application, which leads to an expression of type Nothing which returns a value.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(: foo (All (b ...) ((List (List b ... b) ... b) -> (List (List b ... b) ... b))))
(define (foo fs)
    fs)

(ann ((inst car Nothing Nothing) (first (foo (list (list "string"))))) Nothing)

  | Correctly instantiate poly dots during inference.
  | 
  | This removes the need for the cache of type variables for instantiating
  | dotted variables, because we instantiate the uses at once.
