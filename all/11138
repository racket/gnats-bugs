>Description:
If students run a program in one of the HtDP languages in which they have a definition for a generic function operating on a certain data definition, the function body is highlighted in black since it isn't tested. However this definition is not intended to be tested, so seeing it highlighted is misleading and inconsistent with the purpose of the highlighting. If possible, I think it would be better if templates do not get highlighted in black.
>How-To-Repeat:
For example:

;; Foo is Number

(define (fun-for-foo foo)
   (... foo))
