>Description:
I got the following error message:

foldl: arity mismatch, does not accept 1 argument: #<procedure ...>

Since my expression was pretty complicated, including a match-lambda in function position and HTML generation w/ quasiquoting, I spent a while trying to figure out why it thought I had given foldl only one argument (though the fact that the text isn't the standard arity error made me suspicious).

I finally realized that what it's saying is that in the function position, I've given a procedure that takes only one argument, and it needs to take at least two.  However, this error message sounds like the problem is with foldl itself, to which my reaction was, "Of course foldl doesn't take one argument, that *would* be an arity mismatch error; but I've given it three!"

What makes this message much worse is that the highlighted term is (foldl ...), not the first argument to foldl (which is where the problem is).

I suggest that a better message is something like

foldl: arity mismatch in first argument: needs to accept <n+1> arguments: #<procedure ...>

(and, of course, highlighting the procedural argument, whenever possible).  Otherwise, this is a case of good intentions having bad outcomes.

 We usually say=20
 
   fold: expected procedure of (at least) 2 arguments, given: f=20
 
 would that be okay?=20

 That would be great, because it would shift the blame from foldl to
 its argument.
 
 Please note that in addition to the text, the highlighting is also off.

 Do keep in mind that the highlighting is the stack trace. Also, you
 can compute the precise number of arguments required and report it as
 a conflict between the number of arguments and the arity of the
 procedure (unless it is a nullary or unary proc I guess).
