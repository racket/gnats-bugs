>Description:
I can have "repositories" defined in my "info.rkt", and "make-planet-archive" will appear to see the value, but it will also give a warning as if it didn't see the value.

Quoting output:

> Repositories: "4.x"
[...]
> WARNING:
>	Package's info.rkt does not contain a repositories field. The package will be listed in all repositories by default.

I suspect a conditional is missing in "collects/planet/util.rkt".
