I'm using "Windows 7 Home Premium"

I am going through the tutorial: “Continue: Web Applications in Racket” when I got down to “15 Using an SQL database”, I got the error “ffi-lib: couldn't open "libsqlite3.dll" (The specified module could not be found.; errno=126)”   How do I resolve this error?

 The next release (expected in a matter of days), makes this much easier. 
 The SQLite DLL is included by default and that section of Continue is 
 rewritten to refer to the new db library. You can get a release 
 candidate here: http://pre.racket-lang.org/release, and you can read the 
 updated tutorial here: http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/continue/.
 
 For 5.1.3, you can download the DLL from the SQLite page 
 (http://www.sqlite.org/download.html, the sqlite-dll-win32-... link), 
 rename the DLL to "libsqlite3.dll", and copy it to the "lib" 
 subdirectory of your Racket installation.
