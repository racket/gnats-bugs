>Description:
the drracket menu can completely disappear except for the drracket menu itself. 

the menu may come back if you hit RUN. 
it may also stay away.
>How-To-Repeat:
i suspect that there is a simplification but the following got me into the situation twice in a row: 

create a file bar.rkt 
#lang racket
(define (f x) 10)
(provide/contract
  [f (-> integer? integer?)])

start drracket 
set languages to ISL 
add teachpacks: 2htdp/image and universe 
run 
evaluate 
 (big-bang 5 [to-draw (lambda (x) (circle (+ 10 (* x 100)) 'solid 'red))] [on-tick sub1] [stop-when zero?])
clear all teachpacks
add teachpack: bar.rkt 
STOP: the menu is gone
