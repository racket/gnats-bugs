 Dear Nic, 
 
 I ran your program on the latest release and it works fine. 
 Based on the error message, I conjecture that you created the
 file in DrRacket and saved it from there. When DrRacket saves
 a program in the teaching languages for students (Beginning 
 Student Language, for example) it adds a header to the file 
 that starts with '#reader'. In other words, the file does 
 not contain what you think it contains, namely, a batch of 
 numbers. 
 
 Please try to use a program such as TextEdit on your Mac
 instead. 
 
 I am closing the bug report because this is not a mistake
 in the teachpack. 
 
 -- Matthias

 FWIW, I think the teachpack could have a better error message in this
 case. In particular, if it detects the file begins with "#reader" then
 it could say the same thing that you've written below, but in the
 error message.

 Matthias was completely correct - I did indeed create the input file in
 DrRacket, and it had indeed added several lines to the top that I didn't
 notice. It never occurred to me to check the contents of the file again.
 
 I definitely agree with Robby that the teachpack could provide a more useful
 error message. Alternatively, perhaps DrRacket could notice the use of
 extensions like .txt or .dat and ask the user if they want to include the
 Racket specific header info for those files.
 
 Many thanks to everyone for their help.
