>Description:
When a syntax is displayed in DrRacket a special frame appears. In that frame it's possible to "expand" the syntax and see a pretty-print version of it. 

The problem is that when the syntax contains a #hash, the values of the key-values pairs are pretty-printed incorrectly.

The same problem hapens with #hasheqv and #hasheq.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Put this program in DrRacket:
;---
#lang racket
#'#hash((1 . 2)) ;==>  #<syntax:2:2 #hash((1 . 2))> inside a frame
;pretty-print(real):     '#hash((1 . #<syntax:2:20 2>))
;pretty-print(expected): '#hash((1 . 2))

#'#hasheqv((1 . 2)) ; same problem
#'#hasheq((1 . 2)) ; same problem
#'(1 . 2) ; correct ;==> '(1 . 2)
;---

2) Run

3) Expand the first syntax that appears in the immediate window

 It appears that vectors were wrong too, FWIW. They were being turned into
 lists.
