>Description:
The documentation for free-id-table-ref! says that this is just similar to hash-ref!, but for free-id-table.

But failure thunk passed into hash automaticly called while free-id-table just stores it as-is.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require syntax/id-table)

(define x 1)

(define hsh (make-hash))
(printf "Just a value here: ~a\n" (hash-ref! hsh 1 (thunk 98)))

(define tbl (make-free-id-table))
(printf "But here we get thunk: ~a\n" (free-id-table-ref! tbl #'x (thunk 99)))
(printf "... that returns: ~a" ((free-id-table-ref tbl #'x)))
