>Description:
Hi
I have this ss file that keeps growing. Anyway this is the second time that it's somehow become corrupted after saving

This is the message that I get when I try to open:

insert-file in text%: error loading the file

===context===
/Applications/PLT  Scheme
v4.2/collects/mred/private/wxme/text.ss:2538:2:

The first time I opened it as a text file and reformatted the entire thing. Then kept a backup. This time when backing up both the original and the backup give me this message.

Any known fixes?
Thanks
John

 Possibly.
 
 Please try the current pre-release version:
 
   http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/
 
 If that version can open the file, then saving should repair the file
 for the old version. If the latest version can't read the file, let me
 know.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
