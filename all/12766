>Description:
The grammars of the *SL languages contain the following production for expressions:

 expr = ...
  | (and expr expr expr ...)
  | (or expr expr expr ...)

The correct grammar should be

 expr = ...
  | (and expr expr ...)
  | (or expr expr ...)

If you run (and (< 1 2)) in any of the five *SLs, you get the following error: 

and: expects at least 2 arguments, but found only 1 in: (and (< 0 1))

 Matthias,
 
 the current grammar specifies at least _three_ arguments to and/or, and 
 this is clearly wrong.

 (and expr expr expr ...) means 2 mandatory expressions PLUS 0 or more expressions. 
 
 In general ANYTING ... means 0 or more of ANYTHING.
