>Description:
I made somewhere on the order of ten million threads, and after running for about four and a half minutes, drscheme aborted silently.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's the code that crashed it:

(define (one? lst)
  (if (empty? lst) 
      false
      (empty? (cdr lst))))

(define (append? lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? lst) false]
    [(one? lst) false]
    [(list? lst) true])) 

(define (get one)
  (if (one? one)
      (car one)
      error))

(define (thread-split lst fun1 fun2 comb)
  (let* ([cur (current-thread)]
        [len (+ (random (- (length lst) 1)) 1)]
        [firstlst (take len lst)] [secondlst (drop len lst)]        
        [thunk1 (lambda () (thread-send cur (list (fun1 firstlst) 1) ))]
        [thunk2 (lambda () (thread-send cur (list (fun2 secondlst) 2) ))]
        [null1 (thread thunk1)] [null2 (thread thunk2)]
        [tmp1 (thread-receive)] [tmp2 (thread-receive)]
        [res1 (first (if (= (second tmp1) 1) tmp1 tmp2))]
        [res2 (first (if (= (second tmp1) 1) tmp2 tmp1))])
  (comb res1 res2)))

(define (thread-length lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? lst) 0]
    [(one? lst) 1]
    [(append? lst) (thread-split lst (lambda (x) (thread-length x)) (lambda (y) (thread-length y)) (lambda (x y) (+ x y)))]))

and then calling (thread-length) on a ten-million element list.
