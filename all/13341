>Description:
Fully expand the program in reproduction steps, and observe that (#%app make-my-vector) appears three times and (#%app make-my-flvector) appears twice.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(require racket/flonum)

(define (make-my-vector) (ann (vector 1.0 2.0 3.0) (Vectorof Flonum)))
(define (make-my-flvector) (flvector 1.0 2.0 3.0))

(vector-ref (make-my-vector) 0)
(flvector-ref (make-my-flvector) 0)
