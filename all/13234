>Description:
The pattern matching in the implementation of correct-expr? looks incorrect.  Here's an example that demonstrates the bug:

;;;
#lang racket
(require xml)
(correct-xexpr? '() (lambda () 1) (lambda (exn) 2))
;;;

This should return 2, as the empty list is not a valid xexpr by the data definition in http://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/index.html#(def._((lib._xml/main..rkt)._xexpr~3f))
