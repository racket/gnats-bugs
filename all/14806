Students in my class are experiencing DrRacket (v6.1) quoting unexpectedly and displaying the message that "DrRack GUI quit unexpectedly". We have tried to replace the users' DrRacket preference files, but did not work. We have now resorted to reverting back to a previous version of DrRacket. Students are working on networked machines. DrRacket is installed locally, but files are saved remotely to a server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket, move window around screen or push to left or right. DrRacket GUI unexpectedly quits.

 This problem should be fixed in the upcoming v6.1.1 release. For now,
 you can try a pre-release candidate from here:
