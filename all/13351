>Description:
The Racket Guide says:
------------------------------------
6.4 Imports: require
The require form imports from another module. A require form can appear within a module, in which case it introduces bindings from the specified module into importing module. A require form can also appear at the top level, in which case it both imports bindings and instantiates the specified module; that is, it evaluates the body definitions and expressions of the specified module, if they have not been evaluated already.

At first reading that implied to me that the following program should not print abc since  (require (submod ".." x) is at the module level and not at the top level. Perhaps the documentation can be made a little clearer.


#lang racket
(module x racket (display "abc"))
(module y racket (require (submod ".." x)))
(require 'y)

>abc
