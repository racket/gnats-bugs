>Description:
See below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following as foo.rkt, load into DrRacket, and run:

#lang typed/racket

(struct: foo ([x : Integer]) #:mutable)

(: f (Integer -> foo))
(define (f x) (foo x))

Upon execution, the type checker complains that `foo' is untyped in the body of `f'.

Removing the #:mutable flag makes the type error go away, as does using define-struct: and make-foo.
