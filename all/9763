>Description:
For example when you hit F1 while in Beginning Student, and thus your context is L:lang/htdp-beginner, useful teachpacks like world.ss are not returned as results.  This means that you have to clear the context in order to look for them, and that shouldn't be necessary.
>How-To-Repeat:
(Assuming you don't already have a search context set)

1. Start DrScheme
2. Select "Beginning Student"
3. Type something from world.ss (like "stop-when")
4. Hit F1
5. No profiting happens.

 Eli: if this is my PR, pls. let me know. (Otherwise, I'll assume
 you're looking into it.)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 It's a documentation issue -- a problem that I mentioned in the past:
 I need to implement an `or' operator, which means that I also need to
 implement parens or some alternative syntax for such complex queries.
 I don't have a good plan yet (but I'll need to do it eventually).
