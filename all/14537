>Description:
At head I run "raco setup -D --unused-pkg-deps" and get that pretty much every dependency is unused.

My guess is that it doesn't handle my environment setup and it should:
PLTCOMPILEDROOTS=/Users/endobson/proj/racket/compile-root/@(version)/


Example:
raco setup: unused dependencies detected
