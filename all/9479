When Search Manuals loads, I immediately get the following error (reported in FireBug).  Subsequent queries fail as well.

str has no properties

InitializeSearch()search.js (line 171)
[Break on this error] return str.replace(/\s\s*/g," ") // single spaces

 Funny that you find this now -- just last night someone else noticed
 it and I fixed it.  To verify that it's the same problem, you can open
 "scribble-common.js" and on the 4th line change "return null" to
 "return def".
