>Description:
The student language Test Results window does not show up until there is a failure, and clears the old failures when subsequent runs produce new failures.  Once the window is open, however, if the tests are fixed such that "All tests passed!" displays in the REPL, the last run of bugs stays up in the window.  The window should either be cleared or removed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following program in the Beginning Student language:

(define (square x)
  (+ x x))
(check-expect (square 0) 0)
(check-expect (square 1) 1)
(check-expect (square 2) 4)

Click Run to get an error on the (square 1) example.  Change + to * to fix the bug and Run again.  The bug remains, despite the "All tests passed!" message.
