>Description:
The documentation describes dictionaries as sequences, yet they don't work as described.

A dictionary can be used as a two-valued sequence (see Sequences). The associations of the dictionary serve as elements of the sequence.

Yet this doesn't work for alists or vectors. Also not all structures which are dictionaries are sequences.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require syntax/id-table)

(define t (make-free-id-table))
(dict? t)
(sequence? t)
