>Description:
The documentation for underlay/offset was apparently copied+pasted from overlay/offset; it says: "Just like overlay, this function lines up its image arguments on top of each other. Unlike overlay, it moves i2 by x pixels to the right and y down before overlaying them."

So, s/overlay/underlay/g in that paragraph.
