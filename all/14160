>Description:
In most contexts where a name appears (other than a "foo:" in error
message prefixes) the name is `quoted'.  TR doesn't do that with its
"Polymorphic function" which can result in confusing error messages.

>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(: call : (All (A B) (A -> B) A -> B))
(define (call f x) (f x))
(call add1 'x)

-->

Type Checker: Polymorphic function call could not be applied ...
