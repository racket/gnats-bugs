>Description:
From Racket 7.0 documentation:

"It handles a special result from a custom input port (see make-custom-input-port) by treating it as a single expression"

This is from the explanation of port-read-handler: https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Reading.html?q=port-read-handler#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._port-read-handler%29%29

If "... make-custom-input-port ..." refers to make-input-port, it may be better to revise it; or not.

Thanks for all your hard works.
