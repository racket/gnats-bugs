>Description:
It is not clear from the Help Desk documentation what "append" is supposed to do. The last paragraph is particularly unclear:

"The last argument need not be a list, in which case the result is an 'improper list.'"

From this, I deduced that this should work, but it doesn't:

(append (list 1 2) (list 3 4) 5)

Then I thought that perhaps it meant this should work, but it doesn't:

(append 1 2 3 4)

I see that the previous functions start out with "The lst argument need not actually be a list" (rather than "The last argument...") and thought this might be a typo. But "The lst argument" doesn't make sense in this context, either.

I'm not sure, either, about the meaning of "The last argument is used directly in the tail of the result." From what I see, it looks like the last argument becomes the tail of the result. I would expect that to be obvious, so I don't see what the point would be.

I would appreciate it if in addition to clarifying this in the documentation, you could also clarify it in the response to the bug report, so that I can be sure I understand the behavior of the function.

 Alan,
 
 It looks like you are using the "Intermediate Student with lambda"
 language, but reading the documentation for append from the "Racket"
 language.  In Help Desk, a lot of hits come up in a search for
 "append"; you want the one followed by "provided from
 lang/htdp-intermediate-lambda".  That one correctly describes the
 append you are using as requiring lists in all arguments.  Here's the
 relevant documentation:
 
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/intermediate-lambda-prim-op.html?q=
 =3Dappend#%28def._%28lib._htdp-intermediate-lambda..ss._lang%29._%28%28lib.=
 _lang/htdp-intermediate-lambda..rkt%29._append%29%29
 
 I hope that helps!
 
 Carl Eastlund
