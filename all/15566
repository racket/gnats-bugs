>Description:
When entering the code below in the definitions window and then evaluating said definitions, DrRacket will enter a seemingly infinite loop. Me and my colleagues have no idea why. Selecting "No debugging or profiling" seems to resolve the issues.

(define (some-procedure a)
  (define (other-procedure b)
    (if (= b 0)
        '()
        (cons b (other-procedure (- b 1)))))
  (define (another-one c)
    (if (null? (cdr c))
        c
        (another-one (cdr c))))
  (other-procedure a))
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Set langauge to R5RS using the "Choose Language..." menu
2. Type the following code in the definitions window:
(define (some-procedure a)
  (define (other-procedure b)
    (if (= b 0)
        '()
        (cons b (other-procedure (- b 1)))))
  (define (another-one c)
    (if (null? (cdr c))
        c
        (another-one (cdr c))))
  (other-procedure a))
3. Run the code in the definitions window
