>Description:
The new find is very nice. Nevertheless some suggestions.

When using the find utility at the bottom of the DrScheme window, all occurrences of the text to be searched for are marked, but the currently selected hit is not highlighted. (Control G and Control R do highlight)

Typing a newline in the "search what?" buffer seems to do a find-next and highlights the new focus with yellow background. Would it be possible and desirable to make newlines part of the text being searched (as it was before the new fancy find features were added)

When the focus is in the find or replace buffer, control R etc are not operational. It would be nice if control R etc would move the focus back to the most recent focus in the definitions or interaction window and searching from there.

The hide button is dangerously close to the replace$find button. I suggest moving the repace$find button immediately to the right of the field containing the current number of matches. This also will reduce mouse movements when alternately pressing "find" and "replace$find".

Finally: would a be possible to include an option such as to find whole identifiers/keywords only (provided the search text is an identifier cq keyword)

DrScheme is great!
Best wishes, Jos

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 17 Feb 2011 08:53:48 -0500
Reason>>> 
There were a number of changes to search & replace since
this PR was put in; they don't really match what was asked
for but Jos has reported that he's now happy with the
current state (partly because he is relying now more on
check syntax's rename identifier feature)


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:48:10 -0500
Reason>>> robby closed
