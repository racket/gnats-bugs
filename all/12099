 Racket uses immutable pairs and lists by default.
 
 See this post for rationale:
 http://blog.racket-lang.org/2007/11/getting-rid-of-set-car-and-set-cdr.html
 
 You can use set-mcar! and friends if you really want mutable pairs
 though.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Regardless of the default, the error message should mention
 `set-car!', and not `set-cdr!'.
 
 The error message is fine on a recent Racket (git HEAD from a couple
 of days ago), so the problem has probably been solved.
 
 Connor: Could you check with the latest release to see if it still
 happens on your setup? Thanks!
