 The input string should use "/" for delimiters, and it looks like
 something on the way is using windows paths and doesn't convert
 backslashes to slashes.

 I don't remember now if on windows it converts backslashes if given as
 input -- sounds like you want that to be done.

 Probably the script itself is just broken, somewhere assumign that
 paths have \\ or / in them.
 
 I'd probably take the argument and call string->path on it and then
 only operate on the path level from then on (use split-path and
 build-path to get the components if necc). That way completion in the
 shell, etc works.
 
 Alternatively, if you really want to insist on / in the command line,
 then the first think I'd do is to break up the command-line string
 with a regexp, put it together with build-path and then operate at the
 path level from then on.

 Oh, I see. You probably want to keep things as lists of path segments
 or something, then.

 It shouldn't operate on paths since the database is platform
 independent.

 Yes, that's what it should have done, but I didn't convert the
 bslashes on windows right after it's done with paths and moves on to
 that representation.  I pushed something that should fix it now -- can
 you see if it works?

 If this is what you tried, then you probably wrote "c" instead of "u"
 by mistake.  (And it takes enough time to look like it doesn't
 terminate...)
 
 I'm done with my class now, so I tried your original complaint line
 before and after the fix, and it looks like things are fine now.

 Oh, right. Sorry. Here's what I'm getting now:
 
 C:\Users\Administrator\git\plt>Racket.exe -um collects\meta\props get
 plt:drdr-command-line collects/tests/drracket/example-tool.rkt
 props: invalid path argument, expecting a relative `/'-delimited
 string, no `/' suffix, `//', `.', or `..', got:
 "collects\\tests\\drracket\\example-tool.rkt"
 
 I don't see a commit that corresponds to a fix from you about the
 props file, tho. I did "git remote update" and then "gitk --all" and I
 see two commits from you, neither of which seem to change this file.

 *sigh*
 
 In my rush it looks like I didn't actually push the commit -- and I
 was already digging through the server logs to find out why it didn't
 catch that "Fixes" line for the PR...
 
 Pushed now.
