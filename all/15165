>Description:
I'm happily using `type-output-sexpr-tweaker` in my class
language, which generally works fine.  The one exception
(bad pun warning) is type errors, where types don't go
through the tweaker.  (Resulting in great confusage in my
class, since we're using infix arrows.)

It would be nice if it gets used there too.

Looking at the code, it seems like there's a bunch of places
that print types without going through `pretty-format-type`.
One of them is `stringify-domain` (in tc-app-helper.rkt)
which is where the offending "->" from the second part I
mentioned earlier is found.  It also has some hard-wired "*"
and "..." which my tweaker wants to tweak.

`make-printable` and `cleanup-type` are two more that seem
like they should use `pretty-format-type`.
