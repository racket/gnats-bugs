This Gist https://gist.github.com/samth/5751258, when run, has a very strange bug.

At the REPL in drracket, if I do: 


> (send (new octokit%) meta)
define-values: assignment disallowed;
 cannot re-define a constant
  constant: lifted.0.2

But then a second time, it works:

> (send (new octokit%) meta)
'#hasheq((hooks . ("204.232.175.64/27" "192.30.252.0/22")) (git . ("207.97.227.239/32")))

 I narrowed your test case down a bit to this:
 
   #lang racket/base
   (require racket/class net/url)
 
   post-impure-port
   purify-port
   get-pure-port/headers
   head-impure-port
   get-pure-port/headers
   string->url
   head-impure-port
 
   (define c% (class object% (super-new)))
   (define c (new c%))
 
 With the REPL interaction like this:
 
   > delete-impure-port
   define-values: assignment disallowed;
    cannot re-define a constant
     constant: lifted.0.2
 
 Note that if you delete any of those identifiers at the beginning, the
 error goes away. I don't think the precise set of functions is
 fundamental (just that they're contracted, I think), but it's finnicky
 and certain combinations don't display the bug.
 
 Also, if you take out the class instantiation, it doesn't display the
 bug. Presumably this is because the bug is in lifting expressions (both
 the contracted functions and the class instantiation peform lifts).
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Wow, that's impressively weird.  I think this must be an
 expander/compiler/runtime bug.
