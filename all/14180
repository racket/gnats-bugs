I'm having trouble with raco pkg and raco doc.

If I

  $ raco pkg install rfc6455
  $ raco doc rfc6455

then no matches are found. The URL displayed in my browser is

  file:///home/tonyg/.racket/development/doc/search/index.html?q=rfc6455

However, if I instead load

  file:///home/tonyg/src/racket/racket/doc/search/index.html?q=rfc6455

then I get the expected matches. From there, I can browse to the package documentation. However, if from any of these pages I enter "rfc6455" as a search term in the search box in the top left of the page, I'm back to the no-results-found ".../.racket/development/..." version of the page.

I'd expect to see search matches

 (a) in response to raco doc, and
 (b) in response to a search in the page top-left search box.

 Your default package scope set to "installation", right? (The
 information included in the bug report says that "rfc6455" is installed
 in installation scope.)
 
 Does running `raco setup` fix `raco doc`?
 
 
 I think the problem is that installing package in "installation" scope
 only sets up the installation, avoiding anything user-specific. But
 `raco doc` sees that you have a user-specific documentation index, so
 it uses that.
 
 If that's right, I'm not sure of the repair. It seems wrong to me that
 package operations on "installation" scope would perform user-specific
 work, but it also seems wrong that `raco doc` doesn't work after
 installing the package.
 
 Changing the user-specific main page and search page to use the
 installation main page and search page (instead of duplicating it)
 would solve the problem, but that's a big change, and I'm not sure how
 to make it work.

 I don't think I've ever changed it. Should it be "installation"? Is that
 intended to be the default?
 
 (I've just checked: the docs suggest "user" scope is supposed to be the
 default, so I guess something must have changed it at some time... it
 wasn't anything I intended to do, though.)
 
 How do I find out? I tried "raco pkg config" but that just prints an
 error, and there seems to be no way of printing the current active
 configuration that I can see.

 No.

 Sounds plausible. But that doesn't quite account for the behaviour when
 I search using the search box in the top left of every page -- that,
 too, goes to the user-specific documentation index.

 Yep.
 
 I'd expect the documentation indexes to have the same scope that
 racket's (require) has. Could the search page pull in all of the various
 indexes at once?

 Yes. I forgot that the makefile sets the default package scope to
 "installation" at the same time that it sets the installation name to
 "development". (See "INSTALL.txt".)

 I'll change `raco pkg config` so that it lists all keys and values when
 no arguments are given. (I'll also improve `--help` output and error
 reporting in general.)

 I think I see why, and I should be able to fix that.

 When you visit the user-scope search or main page, then a cookie stores
 the address of that page. Afterward, when you go "up" or when you
 search, then cookie sends you to the user-scope page instead of the
 installation-scope page.

 Well, I tried to anticipate this suggestion:
 
  Changing the user-specific main page and search page to use the
  installation main page and search page (instead of duplicating it)
  would solve the problem, but that's a big change, and I'm not sure how
  to make it work.
 
 So, "yes, but probably not for v6.0".
 
 I think breaking out the search part is not trivial, but also not too
 difficult. The user-scope main page is currently static, so I'm less
 sure of how to make it pull from the installation-scope page.
