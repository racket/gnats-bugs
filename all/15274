>Description:
In 6.4, a call to bigfloat? (from the math collection) fails when given a mutable list (from the racket/mpair collection). I have not seen this failure in previous versions.

The error is:
bigfloat?: broke its own contract
  Attempted to use a higher-order value passed as `Any` in untyped code: (mcons 'this (mcons 'is (mcons 'a (mcons 'proper (mcons 'list '())))))
  in: the 1st argument of
      a part of the or/c of
      (or/c
       struct-predicate-procedure?/c
       (-> Any (or/c #f #t)))
  contract from: (interface for bigfloat?)
  blaming: (interface for bigfloat?)
   (assuming the contract is correct)
  at: <pkgs>/math-lib/math/private/bigfloat/bigfloat-mpfr.rkt:18.18
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require math/bigfloat
         racket/mpair)
(define m (mlist 'this 'is 'a 'proper 'list))
(bigfloat? m)
