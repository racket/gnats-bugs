I appreciate the cmd-C and cmd-U additions to the language
menu a lot. (I could be the person who switches most between
racket and *sl.) But cmd-C -- as is -- is nearly useless. 

In addition to jumping to the "choose a language" radio button, 
it should jump to BSL in the HtDP menu. From there, I can reach 
almost all languages with two/three keystrokes (arrows), I can't
even move into the menu with cmd-C as is.

 If you fiddle with the arrow keys, you'll get something to happen (try
 up maybe?). I'll work on improving this shortly.

 I think that the issue was only a problem (I say "only" because the
 language dialog is a fairly complex state machine, not because you
 this probably is one you see rarely :) when you open the dialog and it
 starts out in the module language. That is, when you start out in a
 teaching language (or anything else in the bottom) and switch up to
 the module language and back down again, things work as you would
 like.
 
 So, I added a preference that tracks the last language used in the
 hierlist region of the dialog and, when the dialog is opened and the
 initial settings are in the module language, it sets the selection of
 the hierlist to that remembered language (note that the default value
 for this remembered thing is #f, so you will need to click at least
 once in there).

 Thanks, seems to work like charm.
