>Description:
docs.racket-lang.org uses JS in a way that leads to two issues:

1. Minor: the header is loaded after the page is rendered, which makes
   it look weird.

2. When JS is disabled, the layout is bad: two things that I see are
   a weird gap at the top, and the version number ("v.6.1") is rendered
   on top of the "R" in "Racket".  (More on that number in a later bug.)
