>Description:
When the info procedure of a #lang is given the key 'drracket:keystrokes, it can respond with a list of keybindings: [List-of [List Key [text% event% -> any]]]. It appears that DrRacket binds all the keys mentioned in the list to the last procedure in the list. I’ve included a minimal example below.

The relevant DrRacket code is here:

https://github.com/racket/drracket/blob/e99b8d5d6b34db65487e61362f45e35df188ce80/drracket/drracket/private/module-language-tools.rkt#L339

It appears that the keybinding is indirected through a name that is generated from the callback procedure object. However, using named procedures rather than lambdas did not result in a change in behavior, so I don't really understand what's going on.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a lang/reader.rkt file containing the following:

#lang s-exp syntax/module-reader
racket
#:info info
#:read-syntax read-syntax

(require racket)

(define (info key defval default)
  (case key
    [(drracket:keystrokes)
     `(["a" ,(λ (text event)
                (send text insert #\X))]
       ["b" ,(λ (text event)
                (send text insert #\Y))]
       ["c" ,(λ (text event)
                (send text insert #\Z))])]
    [else
      (default key defval)]))

raco pkg install the package, and then load it as a #lang in DrRacket. Observe that typing any of a, b, or c results in Z being inserted in the buffer.
