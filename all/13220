>Description:
By "tooltip" I mean the yellow box that says "binding ... imported from ...".

I've got online expansion turned on in 5.3.  Overall it's great, but it has a strange bug (Windows 7).  Sometimes, a tooltip will hover for a VERY long time.  By which I mean it'll persist over DrRacket even after I've moved on to do something else, have switched to a different buffer, etc.  And on rare instances, I've even seen it hover over other windows (eg, over Chrome).

I cannot tell in what situations this happens or what makes it go away.  But when it gets into this state, even switching to some other app doesn't help.  Sometimes, it mysteriously goes away on its own.  A few times, I've had to kill and restart DrRacket.

I have been trying to pin down the circumstances for this, but I haven't yet succeeded (the problem is that it isn't until much later that I realize "this is a non-disappearing tooltip").  Hopefully this is gone in the latest release, esp. since online is now on by default.  But I thought I'd file the report in case it jogged any ideas.
