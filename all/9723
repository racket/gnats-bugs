>Description:
When standard Scheme (#lang scheme for example) is loaded in the Definitions window, double clicking on the ellipses should highlight the entire ellipses. Currently, it doesn't recognize it is a single "word". I understand why, it looks like three periods in a row, but it is really meant as more than that. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following code in the definitions window and double click on the ellipses.

(define (attendees ticket-price) 
  ...)

(check-expect (attendees 5) 120)
