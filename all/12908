>Description:
A confusion of names.

Suppose you have a require, like:

(require (only-in "external/main.rkt" [main ast2node])

in a file called example.rkt and suppose also that you have a definition of main in the example.rkt file.

In the only-in form main in "external/main.rkt" is being renamed to ast2node so that it does not conflict with the main function defined in example.txt.

Now, if I click on the occurance of main in the require form and I select "Jump to Definition of main" in the context menu I jump to the definition of main in the file example.rkt, which is clearly not the relevant definition of main.

If I click on ast2node the only option is "Search in Help Desk for ast2node" which is not so good either as there is no information on this homegrown method in the Help Desk.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 14 Jul 2012 23:00:02 -0400
Reason>>> This menu item is a convenience that is not doing any
lexical analysis of the program text to actually determine
where to jump to. For example, the quoted 'x also has the
menu item:

(define x '(x))


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:16:00 -0500
Reason>>> robby closed
