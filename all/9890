>Description:
DrSchme occasionally hangs.  This may be somehow related to the application giving sporatic error messages indicating that it is out of memory (the same error that you would get if you accidentally had infinite recursion).  Generally the error clears if I press "run" again, but it seems like DrScheme hangs shortly thereafter.  As far as I can tell, the application never recovers - my only recourse is to `kill` the application from the command line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use DrScheme on OSX.
