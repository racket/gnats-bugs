>Description:
TaskManager on Windows usually reports most of the CPU going to DrScheme process when there is a DrScheme window up, no matter which window you're working on. And, work in other windows goes slower than normal.

Also, if you, leave a DrScheme window up for a long time without using it, it stops responding, it becomes hard to shut down normally, and I usually resort to shutting it down with TaskManager.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme on a Windows system, run it for a while, then check the processes list with TaskManager. The CPU will probably be 99% active, and DrScheme will have most of it.

 I tried it with both 372 and the recent v4 pre-release, and didn't see
 it (I left it running for hours).  Maybe it's related to ACL?
