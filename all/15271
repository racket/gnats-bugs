Mouse wheel doesn't scroll in editor-canvas%. But it works in listbox. For example, in DrRacket main window doesn't scroll, but in preferences window keyword lists scroll.

 Yes, I indeed see the same: scrolling those lists does work.

 In "gui-lib/mred/private/wx/gtk/canvas.rkt", there's a
 
  (gtk_widget_add_events client-gtk (bitwise-ior GDK_KEY_PRESS_MASK
                                                 GDK_KEY_RELEASE_MASK
                                                 GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK
                                                 GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK
                                                 GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK
                                                 GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE_MASK
                                                 GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY_MASK
                                                 GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY_MASK))
 
 Does adding GDK_SCROLL_MASK to that set fix the problem?
 
 
 I think the problem is related to the switch to GTK+ 3, so if adding
 GDK_SCROLL_MASK doesn't work, a back-up question is whether setting the
 PLT_GTK2 environment variable restores scrolling.
 
 Thanks!

 Yes -- looks like it's working fine, thanks!

 I'm assuming that this switches it to use gtk2, in case of similar
 issues?  -- That's useful to know about.
