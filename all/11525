>Description:
We currently document list? as being "amortized constant time".  This is not quite true.  It is memoized, which improves its behavior, but amortized bounds means every sequence of actions stays under the bound on average even if individual actions go above it.  It is quite easy to defeat this with list?, however: simply construct a list of N elements, and run list? on it.  The very first operation is expensive.  The memoization only pays off if list? is used repeatedly on very large lists.  If list? is used on a list fewer than O(N) times, its average time will be higher than O(1).  We should update the documentation to accurately reflect list?'s running time.
