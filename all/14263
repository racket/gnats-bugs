>Description:
When installing a package using "File > Install Package 
...", the "Install" button remains enabled and pulsing 
all through the installation process. Clicking it again 
during this process appears to abort the installation and 
leave the package in a half-installed state. I would 
expect this button to go into the "clicked" state (light 
blue, dim, and solid) during the install process. 

My guess is that a whole bunch of my students will get 
caught by this.
>How-To-Repeat:
- Choose File > Install Package ...
- Enter this URL: github://github.com/jbclements/racket-handin-client/csc430-wi14
(I have no reason to believe that this package is special, but it's the one I tested.)
- Wait until halfway through the install
- See the Install button still pulsing.
- Click it!
