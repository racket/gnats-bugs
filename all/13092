>Description:
Hi,

There are two little format bugs in Section 3.9.3 of The Racket Reference:

In the explanations after `andmap' and `ormap':

  ... that `proc' is applied to each element of racket[lst], ...

I think it should be

  ... that `proc' is applied to each element of `lst', ...

The attached patch will fix this, you may want to check it out.

Best regards,
lee
