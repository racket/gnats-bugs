>Description:
In v5.3.6, superfluous internal declarations are silently ignored:

  (: foo : Number -> Number)
  (define (foo a)
    (: n : Number)
    (: i : Integer)
    (: s : String)
    a)

This was particularly bad because it doesn't follow what happens when
such declarations are done at the module's toplevel.  Looks this has
been "somewhat fixed" recently, and I do get errors for this, but the
errors are bad:

  y.rkt:5:5: n: unbound identifier in module [...]

It would be nice to see the same error that you get for these things
at the toplevel.

(BTW, this is about a week-old build, in case something changed in
this very recently.)

 Yes.

 Oh good -- having the "unbound identifier" error made me think that
 the code gets transformed in some weird way that leads to that error.

 Just to make sure we're on the same page, you want both cases to produce
 something like the following instead?
 
   ; Type Checker: Declaration for n provided, but n has no definition
 
 That should be easy to change, so I'll look into it. I was the one who
 put in the current error message, and I can't remember if there was a
 reason why I didn't use that message instead.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
