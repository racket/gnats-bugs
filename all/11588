 One problem is that `shared' is looking for `make-'. I'll fix that.
 
 A deeper problem is that `shared' cannot create cycles that involve
 only immutable structs. There's no fix for that, except that immutable
 prefabs could be supported.

 Sorry I distilled this snippet a bit too much. The original had =
 #:mutable in the struct def (and I am happy if shared applies ONLY to =
 mutable structs).=20
 
 [ I consider the deeper problem one of macro composability here. ]=
