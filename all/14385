No compiled binary for windows (at least using the gui library) will run. Those same programs run fine if not compiled to a standalone executable first.
>How-To-Repeat:

This is the program that causes the bug:

#lang racket/gui
(define w% (class frame% (super-new)))
(define w (new w% [label "Test"]))
(send w center)
(send w min-height 200)
(send w min-width 200)
(send w show #t)
(send w focus)

If saved to test.rkt, then:
  - when run as 'racket test.rkt' it runs fine on Windows
  - when compiled as 'raco exe --gui test.rkt' it compiles fine, but when the executable is run I get:

file-exists?: contract violation
  expected: path-string?
  given: #f
  context...:
   c:\program files\racket\collects\racket\file.rkt:393:0: get-prefs
   c:\program files\racket\collects\racket\file.rkt:510:3
   c:\program files\racket\collects\racket\file.rkt:492:0: get-preference75
   ...

racket -v says: Welcome to Racket v6.0.

 Thanks for the report! We have confirmed this bug in version 6.0 and
 fixed it for the next release.
 
 If you'd like to make an executable using a repaired version of Racket,
 you can find a snapshot at either of the following URLs:
