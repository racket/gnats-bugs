>Description:
When I switch from a tab to another, sometimes the text in buffers does not stay where I leaved it.

I have two buffers. In one the cursor is at the end of the text. I click on another tab. Then click on the first tab, and the the text is scrolled down up 4 lines from where I leaved it, moving the cursor out of the screen. 

The tab where this happens has an interaction panel below.

It's difficult to characterize the exact circumstances. It does not happen with every pair of tabs. Between two pairs which causes this, it happens always (and today it's driving me crazy).

 OK, it happens when the first tab has an interaction window below, and
 the second one doesn't.
 
 It looks like that when the first tab is redrawn, DrRacket thinks
 there's no interaction window, and so it positions the text lower than
 it should.

 Ah, thanks. I can see it happening now but I also see what appear to be
 reasonable values being passed to the admin's scroll-to method, so I'm not
 sure why it doesn't scroll. The scroll-to method is returning #t.
 
 Specifically I do this:
 
 - create two tabs, each with a file that has only "#lang racket" and 100
 newlines.
 - in the first one, make the interactions window visibile and scroll to the
 end of the file.
 - switch to the second one (with no interactions visible).
 - switch back.
 
 The last switch shows me a definitions window that would be scrolled to the
 end if the interactions window weren't present, I believe (which means that
 the end of the file isn't visible as it as before the tab switch).
 
 I added the printfs in the diff below and I see reasonable looking numbers
 being passed to scroll-to.

 That's it!
 
 Another clue:  the amount of displacement is proportional to the
 height of the interactions window.

 Okay, one step closer: I think the bug is that the scroll-height private
 field in mred/private/wxme/editor-canvas.rkt is not being set to its proper
 value by the time scroll-to is called.
 
 As far as I can tell, the local variable 'sy' in scroll-to is getting set
 properly (in my experiments the second case is used "fits, need to shift up
 into view") and then do-scroll is called with a good value in its second
 argument. Then in the body of do-scroll, the call to set-scroll-pos (the
 second one, of course) gets the wrong value because the 'min' is taking
 into account an old value of scroll-height; one that is right for the
 previous tab's configuration of editor canvases, but not the current tab.
 
 (That is, as discussed earlier, the setup is two tabs, the first one with:
 definitions and interactions shown, definitions that is longer than the
 visible area and scrolled all the way to the bottom of the file. The second
 one has only the definitions shown. In that configuration, switch from the
 second tab to the first tab.)
