>Description:
On page http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/syntax-notation.html, the notation for a portion of the docs is explained. It gives the example

(something [id ...+] an-expr ...)

It describes the meaning of ...+ as being one or more repetitions of the previous data, in this case id.

It then lists 

(something [x])
(something [x] (+ 1 2))

as being conforming uses of something. Clearly an error.

 Are you sure about that?  I would agree with you if the syntax description was:
 
     (something [id ...+] an-expr ...+)
 
 but as it stands, the "...+" is only on the id sequence, and both
 examples provide a non-empty sequence if ids.

 Ah.  But The patterns ... (zero or more repetitions) and ...+ (one or more
 repetitions) modify the very previous pattern.  It doesn't leave the datum
 alone.
 
 The syntax is remeniscent of regexp pattern syntax, where "a*" notates zero
 or more "a"'s.

 Aaron responded:
 
 Thanks for the clarification. I'm finding the guide to be very well written
 so thanks for that as well.
