>Description:
OK, so "require" in #lang scheme and #lang scheme/base is now much friendlier than it was a few versions ago.  The HtDP teaching languages should have the same "require", so I can say
(require (planet sbloch/tiles))
instead of
(require (planet "install.ss" ("sbloch" "tiles.plt" 1 14)))
