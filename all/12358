Say I launch drracket on file tests/struct-universe.rkt
Then I open private/universe.rkt 
I exploit live CS to jump to the definition of sexp? 

The file exists but I get the error message below: 

open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/Users/matthias/plt/collects/2htdp/tests/check-aux.rkt" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

 I think that something is somehow triggering a
 module-path-index-resolve somewhere in what check syntax is doing in a
 way such that the current-directory is not the right directory (it is
 the dir where drracket started up not the dir where the file being
 check syntax'd is located). Then, by the time that check syntax looks
 for the directory, there is a cache somewhere that's being consulted
 instead of the actual resolution happening.
 
 Problem is, I don't know what's triggering that resolution. I tried
 grepping around for uses for module-path-index-resolve in the tree and
 didn't find any that seemed to be the right thing.
 
 You can see the bad lookup by adding the printf below. cd to
 collects/2htdp/tests/ and do this:
 
 [robby@yanpu] ~/git/plt/collects/2htdp/tests$ drracket ../private/universe.rkt
 
 and then wait for check syntax to finish and you should see the printf
 with the bad directory (pointing to "tests" instead of "private").

 I think the most useful thing would be for me to change
 module-path-index-resolve so that it checks to see if it is going to
 return a path ending in "check-aux.rkt" and then instead printing out
 a stack trace (or just signalling an error), but since it is
 implemented in C, I'm not sure how to do that.
 
 Maybe if Matthew had any advice, that'd be helpful.
