>Description:
When I try to search-replace a word in my program, everything works well until I get to my search word within a comment box. Below are the list of error messages I receive:

=: contract violation
  expected: number?
  given: (cons (object:scheme+copy-self% ...) 45)
  argument position: 1st
  other arguments...:
   874

<DrRacket Internal Error>
=: contract violation
expected: number?
given: (cons (object:scheme+copy-self% ...) 45)
argument position: 1st
other arguments...:
87 (there seems to be more characters after 7 but they are cut off)
>How-To-Repeat:
Ctrl-F, search TRIVIAL-SIZE, and replace with STOP

 Robby
