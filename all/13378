>Description:
position and position-token structs don't compare with each other.  i'm trying to write unit tests for a lexer and i end up having to write my own position-equal? and position-token-equal?
>How-To-Repeat:
#! /usr/bin/env racket
#lang racket/base

(require parser-tools/lex
         rackunit)

(module+ main
  (check-equal? (make-position 1 1 0)
                (make-position 1 1 0)
                "should be able to compare position structs")
  (check-equal? (make-position-token
                 'a (make-position 1 1 0) (make-position 1 1 0))
                (make-position-token
                 'a (make-position 1 1 0) (make-position 1 1 0))
