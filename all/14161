throws the same error message about "the top-level of an interaction",
but both should be plain syntax error instead.  (There's the obvious
question of what error should be printed for (list :print-type), but
the choice is not too important IMO...)

 The first one gives me an error about no arguments. Are you seeing
 something different?

 No -- I mistakingly switched to DrR to mimick more naive users, but
 used 5.3.6, and it seems that the first case was fixed since then.
 
 The two-argument case is still broken though.
