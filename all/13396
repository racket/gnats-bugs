64 bit Arch Linux with herbstluftwm
>Description:
Following your windowing overview[1] until just before section 1.2. Run my program with all the code contained in section 1.1 crashes DrRacket. The programs (both Racket and the frame/panel/canvas example) completely exit.

>How-To-Repeat:
1. follow along through section 1.1 in the windowing overview[1]. Evaluating the panel code causes DrRacket to crash.

 Here is some more information:
 
 - My computer has 8 gb of ram.
 - DrRacket doesn't crash unless herbstluftwm is managing the windows
 on the tag in floating mode.
 - Switching to floating mode from tiling mode immediately causes
 DrRacket to crash
 - X gave the following output:
 --------
 The program 'drracket' received an X Window System error.
 This probably reflects a bug in the program.
 The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
   (Details: serial 59155 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
   (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
    that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
    To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
    option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
    backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
 --------
 
 When I clicked the Pause button and then tried to switch to floating
 mode, I managed to crash the X server.

 Nothing crashed when I ran the gui from Emacs geiser instead of Dr Racket.

 Thanks for the report!
 
 I haven't yet been able to replicate the crash. I've been trying with
 Ubuntu 12.04, but 64-bit and 32-bit, using `herbstluftwm' as installed
 via `apt-get', using an xterm to start DrRacket and `herbstclient' to
 toggle floating mode, and using both v5.3.1 and the current development
 version of Racket.
 
 Any thoughts on what might still be different in my configuration?
