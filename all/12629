 This looks to me like a bug in errortrace.  Ray, can you change the
 settings in the language dialog to "no debugging or profiling" and see
 if the problem goes away?

 Right, DrRacket and Geiser are both much more sophisticated tools.

 The below doesn't look like it's from DrRacket.

 Major portions of the module system were just revised, which is almost
 certainly causing this problem, esp. since it's not specific to TR.
 For the moment, you may need to back up to an earlier version.

 Does the program work in DrRacket?

 PLEASE maintain the CC list!  That probably means using "Reply All" in Gmail.
 
 Ok, that's surely a DrRacket and/or Racket bug.
