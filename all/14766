 Really? We have a whole bugs category exactly for this purpose. Is there a
 different big tracker we're using for this?

 I have no objection to using gnats to keep track of errors or feature
 requests. But downtime is not an error or feature requests. We don't
 want people to submit PRs when they can't access the homepage, for
 instance.

 Downtime can have lots of causes, including software bugs. I guess I'd
 prefer that we allow people to report errors (construed broadly) in
 any of our systems as bugs -- it's not like we have so many bugs that
 it will be a problem.
