>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
The following program crashes Racket at runtime:

#lang typed/racket/base

(: f : Real â†’ Real)
(define (f x)
  (+ 1 (expt 1.0 x)))
(f 0)


Any of the following prevents the crash: turning type-checking off, inlining the function, changing `1.0` to `1`, or removing the (+ 1 ...).
