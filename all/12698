I can't try to recreate this ATM, so this is what I *think* caused it.
It's pretty straightforward, so hopefully this is enough, and it looks like
something that is easy to fix.  Doing the steps below results in an error.
Seems that a fix would be to just not try to delete a file if it doesn't
exist.  (The bad part in this is that it turns off autosaving.)
>How-To-Repeat:
* Start DrRacket and type some text, wait for an autosave file to appear.

* Delete the file.

* Type some more, and get an error:

| Error autosaving "Untitled".
| Autosaving is turned off
| until the file is saved.
| 
| delete-file: cannot delete file: "/home/eli/#mredauto#2#" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

 I see just one unprotected `delete-file' in
 "framework/private/editor.rkt":
 
                (when old-auto-name
                  (delete-file old-auto-name))
 
 Also, in "framework/private/autosave.rkt" there's this:
 
              (with-handlers ([exn:fail?
                               (λ (exn)
                                 (message-box [...])
                                 #f)])
                (delete-file autosave-file)
                #t)
 
 but the fact that there's an error handler just for that, it looks
 like that one is intentional.  (Maybe the deletion of an autosave file
 when one is found on startup?)
