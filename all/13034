>Description:
Hi,

Maybe you want to do a double check about the example
codes in section 7.4 of The Racket Guide:

1. version 3 rev. a

In the definition of dominates-all:

   (for/and ([v lov]) (>= (f v) f@r)))

I think it should be

   (for/and ([v lov]) (>= f@r (f v))))

2. version 3 rev. b

The comment and the definition of is-first-max? doesn't
match:

; r is (second x) for ...

I think it should be

; r is (first x) for the first x in lov+flov s.t. (= (second x) f@r)

3. version 3 rev.b

The last expression in the definition of is-first-max?

   (is-first-max? f@r r (rest lov+flov))))

I believe it should be

   (is-first-max? r f@r (rest lov+flov))))

4. version 4

The comment before the definition of is-first-max? has
the same problem as in problem 2.

Best regards,
lee

 Hi,
 
 Thanks for the fix, but it doesn't fix all the problems. The comment
 before `is-first-max?' still doesn't match
 the codes, the attached patch will fix this.
 
 Best regards,
 lee

 Thanks! Should be fixed now.
