In documentation of formlets (webpage http://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/formlets.html)

there is a comment that says that the formlet input-int is equivalent to 
(to-number input-string) .

This is not true, input-int would give a contract error if a number that is not an integer is passed to it. On the other hand (to-number input-string) would accept any kind of number with no error.

Class changed from "doc-bug" to "change-request" by jay at Mon, 12 Jun 2017 06:29:35 -0400
Reason>>> The documentation and contract are accurate, but qxacur is requesting different 
behavior -- https://github.com/racket/web-server/blob/master/web-server-
lib/web-server/formlets/input.rkt#L458

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Mon, 12 Jun 2017 06:29:35 -0400
Reason>>> input-int is provided for backwards compatibility, so we can't change what it works 
on. You're right that the name was a bad choice because it accepts any number 
and not just integers.

 Hello,
 
    thank you for your reply. I clarify that I was not asking for a
 change in the name of the function. It is an actual bug. I am sending a
 code example at the end of this e-mail, if you run that servlet you will
 have two almost identical formlets, the only difference is that one
 uses  (to-number input-string) and the other one uses (input-int).
 
    Both forms call a page that gives the sum of two numbers.
 
 In the first form one you can use integers, decimals and complex numbers
 and it will be fine. It calls a page that gives the sum of both numbers.
 
 The second form only works with integers, if it receives a non integer
 number one gets the following error message:
 
 input-int: broke its own contract
   promised: integer?
 
 
 I apologize for not sending a code that reproduces the error from the
 beginning.
 
 Best Regards,
 
      Oscar.
