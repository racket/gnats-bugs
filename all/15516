>Description:
When scrolling quickly through a .rkt document in DrRacket, it randomly freezes the display manager.

The trigger seems to be scrolling quickly through a .rkt file.

The issue seems to occur mainly when the "Definitions Area" is the only active pane (i.e. the "Interations Area" is hidden). The issue is harder to reproduce while scrolling through the Definitions area with both panes shown, but that was the situation the issue occured first.

OS: Arch Linux, (Linux archlinux 4.15.3-1-ARCH)
Desktop Environment: Plamsa (KDE 5)
Racket/DrRacket version: 6.12

The only teachpack that has been used is Biginner Student.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a .rkt document with enough content that it is scrollable in DrRacket.

2. Scroll up and down quickly through a .rkt file in the Definitions Area, especially with the Interactions Area hidden.
>Fix:
