>Description:
When generating an executable from DrRacket, and the executable file already exists, a message box appears containing:
----
Are you sure you want to delete C:\Users\bernardip\Documents\Scheme\sexomini-con-for.exe?
----
which is puzzling. "Are you sure you want to replace" would be better.

Also, answering yes to the previous question, if the file cannot be replaced because it's locked by the OS, such as when the exe is in execution, the error appears in an OS box (black background), which can't be closed:

----
delete-file: cannot delete file
  path: C:\Users\bernardip\Documents\Scheme\sexomini-con-for.exe
  system error: Permission denied; errno=13
  context...:
