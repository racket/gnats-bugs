>Description:
On Windows 10, using a screen resolution of 3840x2160, with display scaling set to 200%, the "split pane" cursor (the one that looks like "<-|->") that is used to change the size of the panes in DrRacket is not scaled like other cursors. The arrow cursor and I-beam cursor are scaled properly, but the split-pane cursor is very small and does not appear to be scaled at all. I wish I could add a screenshot, but my screenshot tool doesn't capture the cursor.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket on a 4k (3840x2160) display and set display scaling to 200% (probably other scales are affected too). Move the cursor to resize the panes, and the cursor becomes a very small split-pane cursor.

 I've pushed what is probably a fix to this problem here:
 
    https://github.com/racket/gui/commit/26205f6ae6b4d99f472187b48606057bef62ff94
 
 I don't actually have a display to test this out on, but probably the
 built-in cursors do the right thing (the code was using a homebrew
 cursor from the dawn of time before).
