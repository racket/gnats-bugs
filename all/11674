>Description:
The note at the end of Slatex Wrapper docs is critical to do, but is easily overlooked.  I suggest moving it to the top so it's always seen.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Look up the Slatex Wrapper docs.
2. Find what you need at the top of the page.
3. Run slatex and wonder why it doesn't work.
4. Ask someone who's got it working and have them point you to the random note at the bottom.
5. Feel ashamed while getting lectured again about reading the docs.
