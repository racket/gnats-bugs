>Description:
If you lower the size of the text too much in DrRacket, it seems to throw an error out. The program doesn't crash and it isn't very problematic as no one will try to lower their text size to that low, but it does output an error. I am not sure if this error occurs if you try to increase the size of the text too much as it seems to just keep on increasing.
