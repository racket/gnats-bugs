>Description:
In typed racket the for/hash: for does not seem to allow the use of #:when clauses. For example the following definition:

(define my-hash (for/hash: : (HashTable Integer Integer) 
                  ([x (in-range 10)]
                   [y (in-range 10)]
                   #:when (odd? x))
                 (values x y)))

Gives the error for/hash:: expected optionally type-annotated binding in: #:when


Leaving out the #:when clause works as expected though
(define my-hash (for/hash: : (HashTable Integer Integer) 
                  ([x (in-range 10)]
                   [y (in-range 10)])
                 (values x y)))

will type check correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a typed racket module run the following program

(define my-hash (for/hash: : (HashTable Integer Integer) 
                  ([x (in-range 10)]
                   [y (in-range 10)]
                   #:when (odd? x))
                 (values x y)))
