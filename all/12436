 [General note: these emails had non-ascii characters in the subject,
 which makes email clients encode the subject line in a way that gnats
 doesn't see so they didn't get logged.]

 What happens to you when you click the check syntax button?  These
 problems may be related.

 If they have a consistent way of getting the error to happen, that's
 the most important thing.  The other information would be useful as
 well, particularly the distribution and desktop environment.

 Hello,
 
  > What happens to you when you click the check syntax button?  These

 Nothing much happens beside the status bar says "Check Syntax: color 
 expression". Not being able to break the syntax check I have to kill 
 DrRacket all the time.

 Highlighting is not working at all! No syntax highlighting, no

 If I kill the gdm and restart it as root everything works!!

 Everything works now for me (Ubuntu 11.10, Unity) using the latest 
 release of DrRacket (5.2.1). Meaning bracket highlighting and syntax 
 checker.
 
 Thanks a lot!
