When using with-output-to-file; racket fails to write a large bignum to file. It does show up in console when not redirected to an output file though.

#lang racket

(require racket/flonum)

;; calculate fibonacci number using binet formula
(define (fibonacci-binet-float fl)
   (flround (fl* (fl/ 1.0 (flsqrt 5.0))
               (flexpt (fl/ (fl+ 1.0 (flsqrt 5.0)) 2.0) fl))))

;; optimized fibonacci routine
(define (fibonacci-opt-float fl)
   (if (fl<= fl 1474.0)
       (fibonacci-binet-float fl)
       (letrec ([iterator (lambda (prev cur count)
                             (if (fl<= count 1.0)
                                 (+ prev cur)
                                 (iterator cur (+ prev cur) (fl- count 1.0))))])
               (iterator (fl->exact-integer (fibonacci-binet-float 1473.0))
                         (fl->exact-integer (fibonacci-binet-float 1474.0))
                         (fl- fl 1474.0)))))

 I believe you meant to write (note the lambda):
 
   (with-output-to-file "/tmp/fib-9999999.txt" #:exists 'replace
     (lambda () (display (fibonacci-opt-float 999999.0))))
 
 in which case it works.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 To Asumu,
 
 You're right; thanks a lot! This bug report should be closed.
