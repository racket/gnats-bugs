>Description:
The 2hdtp/universe docs do not define what "dragging" means.  2.1.34 mouse-event% says

(send a-mouse-event dragging?) â†’ boolean?
Returns #t if this was a dragging event (motion while a button is pressed), #f otherwise.

This definition of dragging should be copied into the universe docs to make them more self-contained.
