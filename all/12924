 Where do you see scene? mentioned in the 2htdp/image documentation?

 Sorry, the problem is more complex than I had realized.
 
 There are a couple of functions specified in 2htdp/universe documentation which require or provide a scene. However, wherever scene? occurs it is not hyperlinked to any documentation. Yet, I wanted to know what that documentation said about scene? So, I searched for scene? and clicked on the one entry in the resulting list _not noticing that I had ended up in the old version of htdp/image_. After all, if there is just one entry it has to be the correct one, said my subconscious, too clever by half. So the problems are two and not as I reported it:
 
 1) The current 2htdp/universe documentation specifies several contracts using scene?. I don't know if that documentation is obsolete and should really say image? or not. It seems weird to use in the documentation a predicate that is not documented anywhere else except in the documentation for an obsolete package.
 2) It is far too easy to enter the twilight zone, i.e., the documentation for the old version of the htdp classes, without noticing it. I can't see any easy way to change this, of course.

 I just noticed that there are also some scene links in the text and that =
 they all jump to the old version of the image documentation.
 
 As:
 
  Its size is determined by the size of the first generated scene.
 
 and
 
 ells DrRacket to use a width-expr by height-expr canvas instead of one =
 determine by the first generated scene.
 
 .
 
 Also, there is a typo in the second line if you look very closely, =
 "determine" should be "determined".
 
 But I'm less and less sure what was the original intention for the =
 documentation.

 This looks to me like some clarification in the 2htdp/universe docs is
 needed, or maybe there is just some old docs there, from when scenes
 were more used.

 2htdp/universe can be combined with both 
  [1]  htdp/image 
  [2]  2htdp/image 
 
 When it is combined with [1], it really needs a scene? in the sense of [1]. (Well it did, and I have to check whether this specification is still exploited.) 
 
 When it is combined with [2], it suffices to supply an image. 
 
 I left it like this after you responded with "not yet" last time I asked whether we should complete switch from htdp/image to 2htdp/image. I think what I am hearing is "yes" now and I should probably fix the documentation to eliminate all accommodations of linking with [1].
