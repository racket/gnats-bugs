>Description:
Consider the following example:

  #lang typed/racket
  (require/typed racket/base [list (All (a) Float)])
  (* 3.3 list)

Since the contract generated for `All` is always a `parametric->/c`,
it just checks that it's a function and wraps it for later calls.
This is a bogus contract in this case, however, since the type in the
body is not a function. (the higher-order part of the contract never
triggers anyway since `list` is not called)

As a result, the third line produces an unsafe result.
