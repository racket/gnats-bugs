>Description:
Several functions that work on namespaces or
modules refer to when a module is "declared" or
more generally to a "module declaration", but
this term is never defined. (or at least not
hyperlinked)

Here is an example for `module->imports`:

  Like module-compiled-imports, but produces the
  imports of mod, which must be declared (but not
  necessarily instantiated or visited) in the
  current namespace.

Both "instantiate" and "visit" are hyperlinked, but
not "declare". It's also not obvious that when a module
is instantiated, it also counts as declared (since the
function above will work if you require the module).
