>Description:
I originally had the problem trying to get use plot/dc to a printer-dc% object:

#lang racket/gui

(require plot)

(define (test)
  (let ((dc (new printer-dc%)))
    (send dc start-doc "Printing")
    (send dc start-page)
    (plot/dc
     (function sin (- pi) pi #:label "y = sin(x)")
     dc 0 0 400 400)
    (send dc end-page)
    (send dc end-doc)))

(test)

Gives an error  "class-field-accessor: expected argument of type <object>; given '(40 . 7)".

Neil traced it back to printer-dc% itself. From his e-mail back to me.

Looks like it's an error in `printer-dc%', not in `plot'. Here's a simpler, non-plotting test case:

#lang racket/load

(module printer-test racket/gui
 (define dc (new printer-dc%))

 (send dc start-doc "Printing")
 (send dc start-page)
 (send dc draw-polygon '((40 . 7))))

;(require 'printer-test)  ; class-field-accessor error

(module bitmap-test racket
 (require racket/draw)
 (define bm (make-bitmap 400 400))
 (define dc (make-object bitmap-dc% bm))
 (send dc draw-polygon '((40 . 7))))

(require 'bitmap-test)  ; no error


According to the docs, `draw-polygon' accepts a list of (cons/c real? real?). The `bitmap-dc%' class implements the interface properly, but the `printer-dc%' class doesn't.

I've also verified that `printer-dc%' raises an error when you send pairs of reals to `draw-lines'. That'll also cause plotting directly to a printer to fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define (printer-test)
  (define dc (new printer-dc%))
  (send dc start-doc "Printing")
  (send dc start-page)
  (send dc draw-polygon '((40 . 7)))
  (send dc end-page)
  (send dc end-doc))

(printer-test)

(define (bitmap-test)
  (define bm (make-bitmap 400 400))
  (define dc (make-object bitmap-dc% bm))
  (send dc draw-polygon '((40 . 7))))

(bitmap-test)

The printer-test fails on the draw-polygon to a printer-dc% object while the bitmap-test works with a bitmap-dc% object.
