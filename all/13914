>Description:
I'm using subprocess to execute a binary from command line, but it hangs. I originally used 'system' instead of 'subprocess'. 'system' returns normally, but 'subprocess' hangs when executing the same command.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the link to download everything you need to reproduce the behavior I encounter:
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mangpo/racket-hang.tar.gz

1) link the path variable to the z3 binary
2) run system.rkt

After about 10-20 seconds, (system "z3 debug-syn-3-4.smt2") will return the output from the system call.

3) comment out (system "z3 debug-syn-3-4.smt2") and uncomment (z3 "debug-syn-3-4.smt2")

After 20 seconds, it still doesn't return. If you run it again and consult top to see what's running. You will see that z3 is running for the first 10-20 seconds, and it will terminate, but 'sync/timeout' doesn't return. I change sync/timeout to subprocess-wait, and it doesn't return either.

I test both 'system' and 'subprocess' to execute z3 on debug-syn-1-0.smts which is smaller than debug-syn-3-4.smts, and both 'system' and 'subprocess' return normally.

 I didn't look at your code but just as a quick check: did you close all of
 the ports from the Racket side?

 Hi Robby,
 
 Yes, I do close all ports in the case of timeout. I close input and error
 ports when the process returns and use output port to get data. In the code
 I provide, I don't close the output port, but in the real program I do
 close that port after I'm done using it.
 
 However, I'm not sure if it's relevant in this case because 'sync/timeout'
 call never returns before the program can close any port, unless you wait
 until timeout.

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] all/13914: subprocess hangs unexpectedly

 The difference between "debug-syn-1-0.smt2" and "debug-syn-3-4.smt2" is
 the amount of output that they make `z3' produce on stdout.
 
 When you run `z3', it's going to write lines to stdout, and then it
 exits --- but it only exits after the write to stdout completes.
 
 When you use `(subprocess #f #f #f ...)', the subprocess's stdout is a
 pipe. A pipe has a limit on the number of bytes that it will hold
 between the sender and the receiver. If the pipe is full, the sender
 blocks.
 
 So, when `z3' writes enough output, you have a deadlock between the
 Racket process (which is not yet reading the other end of the pipe but
 waiting for the subprocess to finish) and the z3 process (which won't
 exit until it can push more output through the pipe).
 
 When you use `system', then problem is avoided, because `system' allows
 the subprocess's stdout to go through while it waits for the subprocess
 to complete.
 
 Probably, you want to call `subprocess' as
 
  (subprocess (current-output-port)
              (current-input-port)
              (current-error-port)
              ...)
 
 so that you don't have to worry about pumping the subprocess's stdout
 while waiting for it to finish.

 I see. Thank you so much. I wouldn't figure this out myself. I'll try this

 mt2&quot; and &quot;debug-syn-3-4.smt2&quot; is<br>
 the amount of output that they make `z3&#39; produce on stdout.<br>
 <br>
 When you run `z3&#39;, it&#39;s going to write lines to stdout, and then it=
 <br>
 exits --- but it only exits after the write to stdout completes.<br>
 <br>
 When you use `(subprocess #f #f #f ...)&#39;, the subprocess&#39;s stdout i=
 s a<br>
 pipe. A pipe has a limit on the number of bytes that it will hold<br>
 between the sender and the receiver. If the pipe is full, the sender<br>
 blocks.<br>
 <br>
 So, when `z3&#39; writes enough output, you have a deadlock between the<br>
 Racket process (which is not yet reading the other end of the pipe but<br>
 waiting for the subprocess to finish) and the z3 process (which won&#39;t<b=
 r>
 exit until it can push more output through the pipe).<br>
 <br>
 When you use `system&#39;, then problem is avoided, because `system&#39; al=
 lows<br>
 the subprocess&#39;s stdout to go through while it waits for the subprocess=
 <br>
 to complete.<br>
 <br>
 Probably, you want to call `subprocess&#39; as<br>
 <br>
 =A0(subprocess (current-output-port)<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0(current-input-port)<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0(current-error-port)<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0...)<br>
 <br>
 so that you don&#39;t have to worry about pumping the subprocess&#39;s stdo=
 ut<br>
 while waiting for it to finish.<br>

 &gt; Reported by Mangpo Phothilimthana for release: 5.3.2 - 5.3.5<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; *** Description:<br>
 &gt; I&#39;m using subprocess to execute a binary from command line, but it=
  hangs. I<br>
 &gt; originally used &#39;system&#39; instead of &#39;subprocess&#39;. &#39=
 ;system&#39; returns normally,<br>
 &gt; but &#39;subprocess&#39; hangs when executing the same command.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; *** How to repeat:<br>
 &gt; Here is the link to download everything you need to reproduce the beha=
 vior I<br>
 &gt; encounter:<br>
 &gt; <a href=3D"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mangpo/racket-hang.tar.gz" ta=
 rget=3D"_blank">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mangpo/racket-hang.tar.gz</a>=
 <br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; 1) link the path variable to the z3 binary<br>
 &gt; 2) run system.rkt<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; After about 10-20 seconds, (system &quot;z3 debug-syn-3-4.smt2&quot;) =
 will return the<br>
 &gt; output from the system call.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; 3) comment out (system &quot;z3 debug-syn-3-4.smt2&quot;) and uncommen=
 t (z3<br>
 &gt; &quot;debug-syn-3-4.smt2&quot;)<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; After 20 seconds, it still doesn&#39;t return. If you run it again and=
  consult top<br>
 &gt; to see what&#39;s running. You will see that z3 is running for the fir=
 st 10-20<br>
 &gt; seconds, and it will terminate, but &#39;sync/timeout&#39; doesn&#39;t=
  return. I change<br>
 &gt; sync/timeout to subprocess-wait, and it doesn&#39;t return either.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; I test both &#39;system&#39; and &#39;subprocess&#39; to execute z3 on=
  debug-syn-1-0.smts which<br>
 &gt; is smaller than debug-syn-3-4.smts, and both &#39;system&#39; and &#39=
 ;subprocess&#39; return<br>
 &gt; normally.<br>
