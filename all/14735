Linux
>Description:
I don't think that I've seen anything about changes to focus policies,
and I don't see any HISTORY item about such a change.

The code below used to work fine, and now it fails because the focus is
not on the canvas.  Clicking the canvas does get it focused, as well as
uncommenting the `focus' line.  The last line is me verifying that
there's a single child, so I don't know who has the focus initially.
(Also, pressing tab doesn't help, so it looks like there is no initial
focus.)

This is on linux.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define roulette-canvas%
  (class canvas%
    (super-new)
    (define/override (on-char e) (eprintf "CHAR\n"))
    ;; (send this focus)
    ))

(define f (new frame% [label "Foo"] [min-width 300] [min-height 300]))
(define c (new roulette-canvas% [parent f]))

(send f show #t)
(send f get-children)
