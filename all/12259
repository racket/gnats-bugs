>Description:
Apparently, some flonum code that uses Newton's method to invert a function exposes an optimization error when used in a different module.

I'll try to find a smaller test case the causes the same problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's a standalone program that exposes the problem:

#lang racket
(require plot)

(parameterize ([plot-x-transform  (hand-drawn-transform 200)]
               [plot-y-transform  (hand-drawn-transform 200)])
  (plot (function sqr -1 1)))

=> read (compiled): ill-formed code [../../../racket/gc2/../src/validate.c:806]


A more fine-grained way to discover it: open collects/plot/common/sample.rkt, run it, and enter

(nonlinear-seq -1 1 500 (hand-drawn-transform 200))

=> read (compiled): ill-formed code [../../../racket/gc2/../src/validate.c:806]

Also try the should-be equivalent

(map (invertible-function-finv ((hand-drawn-transform 200) -1 1))
     (linear-seq -1 1 500))

=> internal error: flonum position not found


Now open collects/plot/common/axis-transform.rkt, and try the previous:

(map (invertible-function-finv ((hand-drawn-transform 200) -1 1))
     (linear-seq -1 1 500))

It returns a list of reals between -1 and 1, as it should.


All the code to reproduce the problem should be in axis-transform.rkt: flnewton-invert, sine-diag, sine-diag-diff, sine-diag-inv, make-axis-transform, and the invertible-function struct. (But of course it doesn't reproduce the problem.)
