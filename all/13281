>Description:
When DrRacket is not maximized, open a new file or changing the active tab can cause DrRacket to increase it's width and to change its position.

This can be really annoying, e.g. when you split your screen on windows 7 in 2 parts, left DrRacket, right documentation, browser, ... and when you switch your tabs or open a new racket-file, the windows get more or less overlapped.

Related to this problem, I think, is the fact, that I can't reduce the width of DrRacket to less than about 750px. It's caused by the toolbar, but place the toolbar to the left is not an option. A solution could be to provide a option to place the toolbar at the top, but only with symbols and no symbol-text so that the window-size can be smaller. (Racket does that automatically, when placing the toolbar to the left or to the right).  
>How-To-Repeat:
On a 1600x900 or smaller resolution and windows 7:
Set DrRacket to a size about 800 px, e.g. dock a window at the left and another at the right, using both half of the screen.
Open DrRacket. Open a file with a long name, eg "this-is-a-very-very-long-long-name.rkt"
Two things happen: 
- The DrRacket window doesn't stay at the place it was before, it moves to an other place.
- When you try to put it back to its original-place, you see that now the Window-size of DrRacket has increased, and you can't reduce the width.

Same happens with tabs: open some files in tabs, place drracket to the position and size you want, and change between the tabs.

 Is placing the toolbar on the left not an option because you want the
 horizontal space for your code?

 Ryan: would you consider a shorter name for the "Macro Stepper" button?

 I've pushed a commit that adds the requested option.
 
 In the meantime, if you're not using the git (or nightly build)
 version, you can find this line:
 
 (send button set-label-visible (not vertical?))
 
 in collects/drracket/private/unit.rkt
 
 and change it to:
 
 (send button set-label-visible #f)
 
 and you should be set (restart drracket after the edit).

 Thanks a lot! Works fine in the nightly build.

 That one reason, and the other one (which is only a personal preference, I think) is that I use the vertical-split quite often when correcting solutions of students 
 and then the mouse-way to the left/right toolbar feels often too long for me.

 I've been trying out this "put the window on the left/right"
 keystrokes in windows and I'm noticing that when I open a new file,
 DrRacket's window gets a lot bigger all of the sudden. I'm not sure
 why it does that, tho.

 I haven't been able to think of one.
 
 Also, as people write more button-worthy tools for DrRacket, we'll keep 
 running into this problem. Perhaps at some threshold the non-essential 
 buttons should be collected into a dropdown box?

 Could DrRacket dynamically switch to the all-icon view when the window
 gets narrow?

 How about "Step"? The "#'" in the icon is pretty suggestive and we can
 make sure things are clear from the title of the window.
 
 But yes, I agree that this is a longer-term problem.
 
 But in the meantime, I think that the Macro Stepper button is too
 large and I would prefer not to drop it, but I'm not sure what we
 should do.

 Oh.... that's an interesting thought. I'll give that a try.

 Well, it took me far to long to realize this, but to do Sam's suggestion
 properly, it means that the minimum height of a button depends on the
 available width, something that doesn't work with our current geometry
 management setup. It could be made to work if we changed how that works and
 probably even in a backwards compatible way (with a bunch of special cases).
 
 The reason this happens is because the text of the button might be taller
 than the bitmap and since the text goes away when the button is made
 narrow, it might also get shorter.
 
 For now, I'm trying out how thing work when I just give up on that aspect
 of the buttons and make them always take up the full text-included height.
 This should only be noticeable when someone has a non-default configuration
 that makes the font for controls larger than normal and what they'll see is
 a too tall toolbar when the labels go away. That seems sufficiently rare
 that this at least isn't a non-starter.

 Well, it took me far to long to realize this, but to do Sam&#39;s suggestio=
 n properly, it means that the minimum height of a button depends on the ava=
 ilable width, something that doesn&#39;t work with our current geometry man=
 agement setup. It could be made to work if we changed how that works and pr=
 obably even in a backwards compatible way (with a bunch of special cases).<=

 What if we gave buttons a fixed height, which was the full text height?

 Yes, that's what I meant to say that I'm trying. When there is no
 text, however (and the text would be bigger than the button) it looks
 bad.

 Could we just make those icons bigger?

 Well, we don't know the size of the text until DrRacket starts up. I
 think it won't be a problem in practice. I suggest we deal with it
 when it comes up (I'm also reluctant to add complex code behind
 conditionals that are only true in strange GUI setups).

 Oh, I didn't mean automatically making them bigger, just that if we
 have some icons that are too small, we make new icons that are
 slightly bigger.

 You can set the font size arbitrarily large.

 Okay, I've been playing with this and it seems to be working well. The
 minimum window width on my mac went from 773 to 359 pixels (with a few
 other, minor tweaks too).
