>Description:
Hi, 

For launch-many-worlds/proc, the docs give the following example:
(apply launch-many-worlds/proc
         (build-list (random 10)
                     (lambda (i) (main (number->string i)))))

Based on the signature of the procedure, it seems likely that it should be:
(apply launch-many-worlds/proc
         (build-list (random 10)
                     (lambda (i) (lambda () (main (number->string i))))))

i.e., one lambda (or thunk) is missing.
For students though, maybe the following would be easier to read:
(define (launch-one-world n)
  (lambda ()
    (main (number->string i))))

(apply launch-many-worlds/proc
  (build-list 10 launch-one-world))

But that's just one suggestion.

All the best,
Laurent
P.S.: 2htdp/universe with planet/cute is awesome!
