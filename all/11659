>Description:
On a couple of occasions now, I have had problems with renaming via right-click in check-syntaxed buffers.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the following program, 
 -- check syntax 
 -- right click on tiles 
 -- rename to *tiles 
RESULT: identifiers such as *tilesss show up in buffer. 

Also, replace tiles with *tiles via the replace functionality. Then 
 -- check syntax 
 -- right click on *tiles 
 -- rename to tiles 
RESULT: missing parenthesis to the right of the *first* occurrence of *tiles

#lang racket

(define player%
  (class object% 
    (init-field strategy player# tiles)
    (field [score (set)])

    (super-new)

    (define/private (put t pl)
      (set! tiles(remove t tiles)))))
