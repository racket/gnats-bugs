>Description:
One of my students turned in her homework as a .docx file, so I copied and pasted it into TextEdit, then copied and pasted again into DrR.  I got a dialog pointing out that there were ligatures and other non-normalized characters in the clipboard, so I said "yes, normalize them".  The resulting file, however, still had left and right quotation marks, which don't make any sense in Racket; could these be converted to plain quotation marks at the same time as the ligatures are being converted?  I can do it myself with find-and-replace, but it's sort of a pain.

 Give the student an F for the homework.

 The normalization that is offered there is a specific thing defined as
 a part of unicode standard because some of the characters look almost
 identical (or there are other related issues that can be very
 confusing). It isn't really about what you're asking for.
 
 And I don't think that there is really a good, general solution to the
 specific problem you're experiencing (at least not as a part of
 drracket); you're probably best off writing a script if you see this a
 lot and maybe contributing a planet package eventually.

Reason>>> Fair enough: a two-line shell script does the job.  Not a
Racket problem.
