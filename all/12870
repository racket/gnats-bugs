>Description:
A function defined with `procedure-reduce-keyword-arity` does not seem
to retain its procedure arity correctly for functions like
`procedure-arity-includes?` (but produces the correct result for
`procedure-arity`).

See attached code for examples.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(define f
  (procedure-reduce-keyword-arity
   (lambda (x [y 5] #:z z) x) 
   2 
   '(#:z)
   '(#:z)))

(define g
  (procedure-reduce-keyword-arity
   (lambda (x [y 5] #:z z) x) 
   '(1 2)
   '(#:z)
   '(#:z)))

;; expect #t
(procedure-arity-includes? f 2 #t)
(procedure-arity-includes? g 2 #t)

;; expect success
(contract (->* (number? #:z number?)
               (number?)
               number?)
          f
          'pos
          'neg)

(contract (->* (number? #:z number?)
               (number?)
               number?)
          g
          'pos
          'neg)

;; but this produces '(1 2) as expected
(procedure-arity
 (procedure-reduce-keyword-arity
   (lambda (x [y 5] #:z z) x) 
   '(1 2)
   '(#:z)
   '(#:z)))
