 I think the way to fix this would be to have struct-out be a provide
 pre-transformer which would expand into a reference to "card" which
 seems like it would work fine if the struct defines card as a
 constructor. But if it doesn't, then I'm not sure what's the right way
 to tell check syntax about this "reference" to card.
 
 SImilarly, this program doesn't have the arrow we want and I'm not
 sure how it should be fixed. Any ideas?
 
 #lang racket
 (struct card (x) #:constructor-name cut-up)
 (match (cut-up 1)
   [(card 1) 1]
   [_ 2])

 This program seems not to have an arrow even without the
 `#:constructor-name`. I think this is a bug in `match`, which should
 use `disappeared-use` -- I'll look into that.

 Oh of course! Disappeared-use. Duh me.

 Turns out I was already using `disappeared-use` there, but it had
 broken (I think with the new macro system) because of a missing
 syntax-local-introduce.
