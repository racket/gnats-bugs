>Description:
I don't know if this is a bug report or a change request,
but it appears that check syntax doesn't yet support
submodules, in the sense that doesn't display cross-module
requires and bindings
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter this program:

#lang racket

(require racket/system)

(module+ test 
  (system "ls"))

After check syntax is ready, hover over racket/system,
see it highlighted red. Hover over 'system', see no
arrow.

Apologies if this is an obvious, known, or 
already-discussed issue.
