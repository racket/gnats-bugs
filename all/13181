>Description:
In a combo-field%, the mouse cursor is not always correctly set to an arrow when moving the mouse cursor from the text-entry area to the drop-down-arrow area.

The effect can be demonstrated by moving the mouse cursor repeatedly back and forth from the text-entry area to the drop-down-arrow area. After several shifts the mouse cursor seems to stick as an I-beam for several shifts back and forth until at some point it again starts switching correctly back to arrow when over the drop-down-arrow area.

Sometimes moving the mouse cursor very slowly from text-entry area to the drop-down-arrow area you can see the mouse cursor switch from an I-bean to an arrow as the mouse cursor just leaves the text-entry area and then is switched very quickly again to an I-beam as the mouse cursor just enters the drop-down-arrow area.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require racket/gui)

(define f 
  (new frame%
    [label "test mouse cursor"]
    [width 300]
    [height 200]
    ))

(define c
  (new combo-field%
    [parent f]
    [label "combo-field"]
    [choices (list "alpha" "bravo" "charlie")]
    ))

(send f show #t)
