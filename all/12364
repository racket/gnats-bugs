>Description:
See below
>How-To-Repeat:
On Ubuntu 11.10 ("Oneiric Ocelot"), I installed postgres via "sudo aptitude install postgresql".

Then I ran this file via "racket repro.rkt":

    #lang racket

    (require db)
    (define pgc (postgresql-connect #:user "erich" #:database "erich" #:socket 'guess))
    (start-transaction pgc)

I saw

racket repro.rkt 
start-transaction: self-contract violation, expected: void?, given: '#(command ((command . "BEGIN")))
  contract from: <collects>/db/base.rkt, blaming: <collects>/db/base.rkt
  contract: 
    (->*
     (connection?)
     (#:isolation

       'repeatable-read
       'read-committed
       'read-uncommitted
       #f))
     void?)
