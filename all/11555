The doc for (read-bitmap) indicates path-string? or input-port?, but only path-string? works.  This helper function calls (make-object bitmap% ....) which does now accommodate an input-port.

(The input-port is a welcome feature.)

 Not really related to the bug and you probably already know this, but
 just in case you probably wanted write this instead of the below:
 
   (call-with-input-file "/some/path/file.png" read-bitmap)
