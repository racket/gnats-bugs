>Description:
The following two functions return something different than what their documentation says.
- racket:get-color-prefs-table
- racket:get-white-on-black-color-prefs-table

Invoking the first one gives the following contract violation:

racket:get-color-prefs-table: broke its contract
  promised: a list of 2 elements
  produced: 3 elements
  complete list: (list 'symbol (object:color% ...) "Symbol")
  in: an element of
      the range of
      (->
       (listof (list/c symbol? (is-a?/c color%))))
  contract from: 
      <pkgs>/gui-lib/framework/main.rkt
  blaming: <pkgs>/gui-lib/framework/main.rkt
   (assuming the contract is correct)
  at: <pkgs>/gui-lib/framework/main.rkt:1482.2
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base
(require framework)

  | fix contracts for racket:get-color-prefs-table and
  | racket:get-white-on-black-color-prefs-table
  | 
  | Apparently these contracts have always been wrong;
  | 5.2.1 had these exports with the wrong contracts and
  | 5.2 didn't have them
