>Description:
Could you add a desktop file for drracket? I've included one at the end of this bug report. Some higher resolutions icons would be nice too (perhaps 64x64 and/or 96x96 for example) or maybe a svg icon. 
Thanks.

 Is there someone who perhaps regularly uses an OS that uses these files and
 is maybe familiar with our friendly new package system give this a shot?
 (Not sure the latter is really necessary, as perhaps the file can just be
 put into git or maybe installed with the drracket collection's info.rkt
 installer step.)

  | Add ".desktop" file support
  | 
  | A launcher can have a ".desktop" file (found like other files: as the
  | same name as the main launcher file, but with a ".desktop" suffix),
  | where the "Exec" and "Icon" fields are added automatically. A ".png"
  | or ".ico" file can be supplied for the icon (where the ".ico" file
  | is already used for Windows launchers).
  | 
  | Closes PR 13953
  | 
  | Fix various problems with Unix-style install from an installer.
  | 
  | Also, add an ugly icon for the Racket Package Manager, with the hope
  | that it will provoke someone to create a nicer one.
