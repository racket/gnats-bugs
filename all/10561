>Description:
The program below gives the error "compile: identifier used out of context in: point-x", and highlights "point" in the first define-struct/contract.  The error goes away and the program runs if the first match clause is commented out.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

(define-struct/contract point
  ([x number?] [y number?])
  #:transparent)
(define-struct/contract (color-point point)
  ([c symbol?])
  #:transparent)

(match (make-color-point 1 2 'red)
  [(struct color-point [dx dy color])
   (list dx dy color)]
  [(struct point [dx dy]) (list dx dy)]
  [v (box v)])

 Thanks for taking on this one!
 
 There are other bugs related to structs, contracts, and subtyping that
 I never really sorted out, if you happen to be in that
 neighborhood.... (this is with provide/contract).

 Adding this to the audit trail, since I think it's the same problem at =
 the root.
