>Description:
A few students in my colleague's HtDP course are having problems installing 6.1 on Windows (I don't know which specific OS).  The install itself goes fine, but at the end, the students click the option to open DrRacket, and instead get taken to a command window.  

They are able to open DrR successfully by browsing through Program Files (and it seems to work fine once open).

The class has 200 students, and only a handful are reporting problems.

Is this a known oddity?
>How-To-Repeat:
Install DrRacket and request to launch it at the end of installation.

 I haven't heard of this before, and I don't have any immediate ideas,
 but I'll look for problems there.
