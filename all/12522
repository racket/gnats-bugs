 Can you give us more information on how this came up? What file did you
 try running that caused this problem?
 
 My guess is that your #lang line is formatted wrong. Do you have
 #lang class/0 at the top of your file?
 
 Note for others: class/0 is part of the course software we're using at NU.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
