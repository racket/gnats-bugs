>Description:
Open a new buffer in DrRacket and write a small module that includes provide/contract (one is provided in the steps to reproduce).  Try running it, or anything that involves expansion, and that will fail.

Save the buffer, then try again, and it will succeed.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a new buffer.

2. Paste the following code in:

-----
#lang racket

(define f add1)

(provide/contract [f (-> number? number?)])
-----

3. Hit Run, or Check Syntax, or step through it in the Macro Stepper.

4. Save, then try again and notice no error this time.
