>Description:
Save the following file in DrRacket, putting an actual image (Insert->Insert image...) in the file where indicated:

#lang slideshow
(require slideshow/code)
(define book <<<PUT_IMAGE_HERE>>> )
(slide
 (code (code:comment "a comment")
       (define FREEZING 32)))

When you run this by clicking "Run" in DrRacket, it works fine and shows two lines of code rendered. But when you run it using the slideshow application (/Applications/Racket/bin/slideshow test.rkt) then the code is rendered as a single long line.
