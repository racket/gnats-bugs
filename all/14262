>Description:
The docs about identifier-binding says that source-phase can be 0 or 1. But it can be any non negative integer. If I understand correctly it can’t be negative and it can’t be #f. The docs about identifier-???-binding have the same error.


See: http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stxcmp.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._identifier-binding))


Proposed changes:

[plt] / pkgs / racket-pkgs / racket-doc / scribblings / reference / stx-comp.scrbl

Lines 105, 187, 201, 215:
-                       (or/c 0 1)
+                       exact-nonnegative-integer? 

Lines 155-156:
-         @item{@racket[_source-phase] is @racket[1] if the source
-         definition is for-syntax, @racket[0] otherwise.}
+         ??? :)
>How-To-Repeat:
For example, in the following code the source-phase is 2.

 The declarations of Typed-Racket have the same problem than the docs.

 Hi! I used this to get a segfault in the typed-racket program.
 
 Sorry for the ugly code. I'm not a TR expert, and it's difficult to
 preserve the (U Zero One) type of the binding phase until it's useful
 to raise the error.
 
 If you uncomment the 'c in [v (vector 'a 'b #;'c)] --> [v (vector 'a
 'b 'c)] then the code doesn't produce an error but the result is wrong
 (2 "one" 'c) instead of (2 "else" 'c).

 Thanks for the report! I can't seem to reproduce the segfault on git
 HEAD, but running your example on 6.0 gives me a #<bad-value>.
 
 In any case, the type is still wrong so I'll go ahead and fix that.
 
 I'll also fix the docs for `identifier-binding` while I'm at it, unless
 someone thinks the documentation is correct and the implementation
 should change.
 
 Thanks,
 Asumu
