>Description:
Not sure if this is to be considered a documentation bug or an implementation bug, but it looks like the string-contains? function provided by the HtDP languages  interprets its first argument as a regular expression, not a literal string. So I had some students that were searching in a string for a period using (string-contains? "." the-str) and this was always true for non-empty strings causing them some confusion. Along the same lines, (string-contains? "?" "hi"), results in an error. (My students were working on an assignment that involved checking strings for punctuation marks.)
