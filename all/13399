>Description:
the scribble/srcdoc language has constructs for documenting functions (proc-doc), values (thing-doc), and parameters (parameter-doc). However there is no corresponding form for documenting user defined structures.
This means that if I want to document structures I would have to document the module in a separate file, which rather defeats the point of scribble/srcdoc
