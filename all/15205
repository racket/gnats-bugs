What should happen: open web browser that searches for that term in the docs.

What happens: Browser window with local copy of manual opens on the "Search manuals" page but it does not actually search for the term.

 I believe the problem is that the file that the file:
 
    /Applications/Racket v6.3/doc/search/index.html
 
 is in Apple's quarantine. It may work to run this from the command line:
 
    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Racket
 v6.3/doc/search/index.html"
 
 Please let us know if that works!
