 Hi: we now have a separate bug tracking system for planet packages.
 Could I trouble you to submit your bug there instead?
 
   http://planet.plt-scheme.org/trac/newticket
 
 (if you have a login to planet already, you can use that login to trac
 too -- but you may have to set your password first. Just set it on the
 planet side and the trac side will pick up the change. Unfortunately,
 we could not initialize the trac-side passwords without knowing the
 planet side ones since they use different hashing functions ...)

 Jay -- this is a result of a batch of improvements I did a short while
 ago to the base64 library.  Here's a relevant bit from the message I
 sent Matthew at the time:
 
   * I'm removing `base64-filename-safe' -- if there's any use for that
     thing, it should definitely not be in the form of side-effecting
     the way that the library works...
 
 IIRC, this was banging new characters into the array, which sounded to
 me like a very bad idea.  (The new implementation takes care to make
 them immutable...)  And BTW, I've looked around but couldn't find any
 RFC or something similar related to a `filename-safe' variant of
 base64.  If you know about one, then point me to it and I'll see if I
 can add the variant in.

 I think that I've seen these -- and it looks like it doesn't justify a
 new library function because it's just a `regexp-replace' away from
 the basic base64 functions, right?  (One to remove the padding and one
 to change the two extra characters.)  The thing that makes me hesitate
 to do this in the library is that there are so many options and
 they're all sort of semi-conventions.  The `regexp-replace' thing
 might be an issue if there were large amounts of data involved, but if
 the goal is a filename-safe or a url-safe string, then it's not going
 to be very long anyway.
