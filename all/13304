>Description:
This seems to require both methods and optional arguments (either alone is fine), which suggests the real bug is that the method expansion is not reusing lambda properly (but that's just a guess).

#lang racket
(send (new (class object%
             (define/public (f [x 1])

      f)

==>  (for example)

(cons
 'core16
 (srcloc 'unsaved-editor286976 3 13 53 129))


but the 'core16 there should be 'f'.

 This is unrelated to the class system.  It happens to regular
 functions with optional arguments.
 
 
 The following at the interactive REPL demonstrates:
 
     > (define (f (x 1))
          (car (continuation-mark-set->context
                          (current-continuation-marks))))
     > (f 1)
     (cons 'core3 (srcloc 'unsaved-editor326 3 2 111 112))
 
 
 Oddly enough, if 'f' is defined in definitions rather than at the
 repl, then the output is different:
 
     > (f 1)
     (cons 'f3 (srcloc 'unsaved-editor427 2 0 14 112))
 
 
 The implementation in racket/private/kw.rkt is probably the place to
 start finding where the names are getting lost, as that's where the
 "core" symbol is being introduced.
