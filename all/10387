 Robby --- looks like there are two problems here, and while digging
 for it I found a third as well.
 
 The first is that the web server isn't configured with the correct
 MIME type for the rss feeds. You want to add the line
 "application/rss+xml    rss" to mime.types in /local/webroot on the
 planet server (I'd do it myself but I no longer have access to user
 wwwplanet who owns the file).
 
 The second is that somehow the link to the RSS feed got hardcoded to
 point to the /300/planet.rss, which is the RSS feed for the older
 repository. I have committed a fix.
 
 The third problem is something I found while investigating. It looks
 like U of C deleted the planet-announce mailing list; it doesn't
 appear on their mailman page anymore and the last mail I got from it
 came in May. Unclear how to deal with that, but getting them to bring
 the mailing list back up or creating a new one at Brown or NU seems
 appropriate. (It'd be good to at least get the list of subscribers
 from U of C if that's possible.)

 I think I did this, but I'm not sure how to tell if I did it right.
 When I visit the url in the PR in firefox, I still just see xml. But
 perhaps visiting the url is the wrong way to test?
 
 I'm happy to tel lyou the password. It is one that you might already know .=

 Thanks. I've updated and restarted the planet server (there was a bug
 in your commit, so there's a new version in iplt).
 
 I click on the little rss icon in the address bar in firefox and I
 think I'm seeing the right thing now.
 
 Is that the right test?

 Apparently, Jim sent you a message asking if that mailing list was
 still useful more than a year ago. Did you reply to that? (techstaff
 claims you didn't reply and thus they deleted the mailing list.)

 What you really want to see is the content-type http header. Many
 applications ignore it, but sometimes its very relevant. You can test
 that with wget -H, and it looks like it's still set incorrectly:
 
  wget -S http://planet.plt-scheme.org/4.x/planet.rss
 --22:14:50--  http://planet.plt-scheme.org/4.x/planet.rss

 The important thing is " Content-Type: text/plain".  You may just need
 to restart the apache server --- "apachectl restart" IIRC.

 I don't remember anything about that and I can't find anything in my
 mail about it, though maybe I'm not looking in the right places. In
 any event, if it's been deleted it probably needs to be replaced.

 Thanks.
 
 They are digging thru the archives and tape backups trying to find the
 subscription list.
 
 (I'll move the mailing list to brown.)

 Thanks. I made sure the server shut down via /local/planet/bin/webctl
 (and planet.plt-scheme.org definitely was down) and then brought it
 back up again and it was still wrong. I see that there are several
 copies of mime.types in various places in the filesystem. Is it
 possible that some config file is looking at the wrong one?
 
 I made an unsuccessful attempt to try to find something along those lines .=

 Ah, you're right. The one you want is  /local/apache/conf/mime.types,
 I believe.
 
 Reason for this belief: /local/apache/conf contains the file
 httpd.conf, Apache's main configuration file. That file points to
 /local/apache/conf/mime.types; I now seem to recall that I copied that
 file into the PLT server's directory, rather than pointing at the same
 file in both places, for some reason that I thought was good at the
 time but that escapes me now.
