>Description:
In the 'Bug Report Form' that I'm typing in just now, some field labels are truncated.

The labels of the fields Name, Summary, and Class, have the last character truncated in half. The Email label is shown as 'Emai', the l is completely not shown.

 This (simpler) program also illustrates the bug. Under windows, I see
 "emai" only in the message% object.
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label ""]))
 (define hp (new horizontal-panel% [parent f]))
 (define msg (new message% [label "email"] [parent hp]))
 (define tf (new text-field% [parent hp] [label #f]))
 (send f show #t)
