>Description:
In the batch-io teachpack, on a Mac, if you use read-lines to read in a file created on a Windows machine, you end up with a bunch of strings that have the \r character at the end of the string.

Note that the built-in function file->lines handles this correctly, and eliminates both the \r and \n characters when reading the file into a list of lines.  So perhaps the easiest fix is to make read-lines an alias for file->lines...
