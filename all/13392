>Description:
Many modern distros enforce "-as-needed" and "-no-undefined" default linker flags, to prevent underlinking [1].

With these flags, libracket-5.3.1.so couldn't be built, please see log excerpt [2].

This happens because libracket is not explicitly linked against the library providing GC_functions (libmzgc-5.3.1.so). This is generally allowed if a library is a dynamic module that could be dlopen()'ed; in this case, it should be reflected with the corresponding "..._LDADD = -module" in Makefile.am (and this will let the build system turn that restrictive flags off as well). In other case, it's an underlinking issue that should be fixed with "..._LIBADD = libmzgc.la".

Thanks,
Dimitri
