>Description:
I wrote a three-line program in ISL+ and created an executable via the Racket menu. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket 

Write this program in ISL+:
(require 2htdp/batch-io)
(define in (read-file 'standard-in))
(define out (write-file 'standard-out in))

Save as io.rkt. 
Menu: Racket | Create Executable 

You get io.dmg in same folder. 
Unpack dmg. 
Move io.app from dmg to folder. 

Now run at Unix prompt: 
$ ./io.app/Contents/MacOS/io 
require: unknown module
  module name: #<resolved-module-path:(submod 'submod #%embedded:g35068:intermediate-funs)>
  context...:
   #%embedded:g34602:htdp-intermediate-lambda: [traversing imports]
   io: [traversing imports]


Conjecture: this could be related to my changes to the documentation in teaching 
languages that I made last summmer. But we have released TWICE since and I don't
see how the lack of 'create executable' could have survived two releases.
