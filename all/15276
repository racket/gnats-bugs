>Description:
See my simplified test below.

Note: define works, but define/contract does not.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define/contract (name1 x)
  (-> number? number?)
  (+ 1 x))

(define namex (name1 1))

(module+ test-x
  (require rackunit)
  (check-equal? 2 (name1 1)))


1. rename name1 in line 1
2. name1 in (module+ ...) unchanged. Drracket complains unbound identifier

 This is a simplified program found by Matthew that demonstrates at
 least one of the problems in the program in this PR, but without the
 contract system in the way.
 
 #lang racket/base
 (define-syntax-rule (m) 1)
 (m)
 (module+ test (m))
