 What's going on is that trim (and split) have a faulty idea of what
 regexps are. If you look at this line:
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/collects/racket/string.rkt#L52
 
 You can see that to trim the front of the string it just adds ^ in
 front of the given regexp (which you can get the string version via
 object-name.) That means that "a|b" is turned into "^a|b" means
 "either starts with a or has a b in it", rather than "starts with an a
 or a b".
 
 I don't think it is sound to just wrap the given regexp in ()s so you
 get "^(a|b)", because I haven't studied the code enough, so I think
 Eli should take a look.
