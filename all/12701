 There isn't a system-independent way to get your IP and MAC addresses.
  You'll need to use some windows-specific calls via the FFI, I
 believe.
 
 For further discussion of this, you should use the
 users@racket-lang.org mailing list, where you're more likely to have
 people see your questions, rather than bug reports.
