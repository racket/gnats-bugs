>Description:
Whenever the cursor is on the bottom line of text in a window, it seems, the autocomplete choices menu is invisible (i.e., it presumably is drawn below the window border, and so doesn't show).  I'm not sure there's a good solution for when the window is too small for the autocomplete choices menu to be drawn, but for most situations it would be preferable for DrScheme to adjust the menu's y-coordinate appropriately.  (For my immediate needs, I'd be happy to have a way to force an editor to remain on one line, and pad its canvas to ensure the menu's visibility.  Any suggestions?)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/gui
(require framework)

(define my-text%
  (class (text:autocomplete-mixin text%)
    (super-new)
    (define/override (get-all-words)
      (list "foo" "bar" "buz" "wah"))
    (define/override (completion-mode-key-event? ke)
      (eqv? (send ke get-key-code) 'f8))
    ))
(define frame (new frame% [label "Example"]))
(define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent frame] [editor (new my-text%)] [line-count 5]))
(send frame show #t)

;; Run the above; typing "f" and pressing F8 on line 1 shows the completion menu,
;; and on line 5 it doesn't. (I've tested under Vista only.)
