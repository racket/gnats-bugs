>Description:
The new documentation in section 5.2 of the web-server uses syntax-parse constructs directly.

If this is supposed to be a fine form for documenting syntaxes, then the documentation of the
relevant bits in `syntax-parse' should be rewritten so they're suitable for consumers of
such macros rather than macro writers.  A potentially useful way to do that would be some fake
bindings with the same name that such documentation pages would point to, which would then get
linked to such a consumer-level documentation for them.

A better solution would be to have some new kind of `defform'-like construct that will render
a form with these things in a readable way.

In any case, this particular definition looks like an awfully long-winded way to write that
there's an optional `#:method method' with the given default expression, and an optional
`else' clause.  IMO, the 11 lines that say that are way less comprehensible.  Note also that
the two forms are shown with the `else'-form first which fits a macro definition, but doesn't
fit documentation consumers.

Another sidenote: the default of #'(or #f "get") looks like a very weird choice -- if there's
a reason for this it should be documented...
