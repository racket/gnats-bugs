>Description:
The program below (a simplification of what appears in collects/scribblings/scribble/manual.scrbl) does not get colored properly in drracket. The scribble colorer doesn't realize that the }|>| terminates the string portion of the sexp beginning with 'string-append', so the following @ is not recognized properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scribble/doc

@string-append[]|<|{
  abcdef
}|>|

@not-a-string
>Fix:
