>Description:
The copy-from method of color%, according to the documentation, returns the object that receives the method call.
However, as implemented the method just returns void.

Excerpt from docs:
"(send a-color copy-from src) â†’ (is-a?/c color%)
  src : (is-a?/c color%)

Copies the RGB values of another color object to this one, returning this object as the result."
>How-To-Repeat:
The following REPL session demonstrates the problem:

> (require racket/draw)
> (define c1 (make-object color% 0 0 0))
> (define c2 (make-object color% 255 255 255))
> (is-a? color% (send c1 copy-from c2))
#f
> (void? (send c1 copy-from c2))
#t
