>Description:
Steps to reproduce:

  * Open GUI package manager, go to "Available from Catalog" tab.
  * Click on "aws" and click "Install"

The following output is produced:

  Resolving "aws" via http://pkgs.racket-lang.org
  Downloading https://github.com/greghendershott/aws/tarball/4735d2f40152797fbdd13e555bde68495e6b81dd
  The following uninstalled packages are listed as dependencies of aws:
     http
     sha
  Would you like to install these dependencies? [Y/n/a/?] 

Since it's not a shell, it's not possible to provide any input. There's nothing
the user can do except "Abort Install".

Reproduced on git HEAD and 6.0.

 It turns out that if I'm running DrRacket from the command-line in the
 foreground and then also type "Y" at the command-line, it will keep
 going. I don't think that's a good mode of operation for a GUI program
 though.

 What is the right behavior here?
 
    --deps search-auto
 
 ?

 Alternatively, a dialog window asking the user if they want to install
 the dependencies sounds good to me too.

 Yes, I think so. In general, I think it should match the defaults of the
 "DWIM" tab (which seems to include "--deps search-auto").

 That seems more complex and not currently supported by the package
 manager's APIs, so I'll just go with the easy thing for now.
