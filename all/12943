>Description:
When an error occurs during a `check-expect' evaluation,
the error message shown in the test-report window
is not rewritten as it is for other error reports.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this BSL program:

 (check-expect (+ "not a number") 0)

The error message shown in the test-report window 
is the raw one from Racket's `+', instead of the
rewritten message that you see in the interactions
window.

 I'll shortly push a commit that makes this program behave like it did
 in the past (I checked 5.2.1, 5.2, and 5.1.3), but the output in the
 test results window has indentation that seems kind of strange.
