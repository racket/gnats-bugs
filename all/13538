4.8.3 : (when test-expr then-expr ...)
        (unless test-expr then-expr ...)

http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/when_unless.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fletstx-scheme..rkt%29._unless%29%29
(when test-expr body ...+)
(unless test-expr body ...+)

> (when #t)
stdin::39: when: bad syntax
  in: (when #t)
  context...:
   /usr/local/racket/collects/racket/private/misc.rkt:87:7
> (unless #f)
stdin::49: unless: bad syntax
  in: (unless #f)
  context...:
   /usr/local/racket/collects/racket/private/misc.rkt:87:7
