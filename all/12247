I start racket using: racket -I datalog

When trying the example at http://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog/Tutorial.html, I type 'parent(john, douglas).' and press enter.

I get the following exception:
stdin::0: compile: unbound identifier (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) at: #%top-interaction in: (#%top-interaction . parent)

 Yes, the REPL only works in DrRacket. At the moment, the Racket
 command line program does not use the same hooks as DrRacket does to
 customize the environment, but it could in the future.

 I don't think this is entirely right.  The Racket repl doesn't invoke
 the same hooks, because the DrRacket REPL is run in the context of a
 module written *in* datalog, where 'racket -I datalog' runs a repl in
 the context of the datalog module itself.  However, this means that
 you need to write `datalog/main' in a language that provides the
 proper information.
 
 See the discussion starting here:
 http://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2011-September/047723.html
 and the commit that I did to fix Typed Racket for this issue here:
