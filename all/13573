 "raco test" doesn't know anything about what it means for a test to
 succeed or fail. It just runs the test submodule, whatever that does
 and doesn't communicate in any way. If the submodule called "exit 1",
 then it would exit from "raco test" but other than that there's no
 notion of failure built in to it. In DrDr, we assume that errors are
 written to STDERR, so that's what we pay attention to, rather than the
 exit code only.

 For reference, this has been fixed, and `echo $?` now produces 1.
