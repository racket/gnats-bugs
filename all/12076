>Description:
If "reencode-input-port" can't decode an input port it gives the following error message:
"format: format string requires 2 arguments, given 1; arguments were: "~a: ~e" "decoding error in input stream"".

It seems that the error reporting uses erroneously the format function.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following code:

(port->bytes (reencode-input-port (open-input-file "16.txt") "utf-8"))

where "16.txt" is a utf-16 text file (It may use any other encoding except utf-8, to trigger the decoding error.)
