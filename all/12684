>Description:
The function rotate (from the 2htdp teachpack images.ss) fails when called with an angle that is not an integer. The error message is:

modulo: expects a integer as 1st argument, given 0.5
>How-To-Repeat:
(define my-angle (/ 1 2))

(angle? my-angle) ; returns true

(rotate my-angle (circle 10 10 "black")) ; fails
