Using equal? to compare identical strings is returning false, when run from inside a future.

I've reproduced with racket and DrRacket, on OS X with Racket 6.5, and Ubuntu 16.04 with Racket 6.3.
>How-To-Repeat:
(for/async ([s (in-list '("a" "b" "c"))])
  (displayln s)
  (displayln (equal? s "b")))

This should say "b" equals "b", but often it says it doesn't.

 I'm not seeing this on either the 64 bit or 32 bit versions of racket,
 downloaded from the website (on mac os x). I get the following output
 (tried many times, always the same):
 
 a
 #f
 b
 #t
 c
 #f

 I think I was able to reproduce this on Linux. This seems to
 consistently print "b\n#f" for the second printout:
 
 taskset 0x01 racket -e "(for/async ([s (in-list '(\"a\" \"b\" \"c\"))]) (displayln s) (displayln (equal? s \"b\"))) (for/async ([s (in-list '(\"a\" \"b\" \"c\"))]) (displayln s) (displayln (equal? s \"b\")))"
 
 Or if you just run "taskset 0x01 racket" and try that expression in
 the REPL a few times it does the same.
 
 Peter, is the machine you are running this on a single core machine?
 
 Cheers,

 I get the behavior described in the bug report if I delete the first 
 displayln, which I would have expected to cause the future to block 
 until the main thread touched it.
 
    > (for/async ([s (in-list '("a" "b" "c"))])
        (displayln (equal? s "b")))
    #f
    #f
    #f
 
 Or better:
 
    > (for/async ([s (in-list '("a" "b" "c"))])
        (printf "~s => ~s\n" s (equal? s "b")))
    "a" => #f
    "b" => #f
    "c" => #f
 
 (Racket 6.4 on x86-64)

 Ah, yes. I see that too. And it appears to go back to v5.2 (was that
 the first one with futures?) using this program:
 
 #lang racket
 (for-each
  touch
  (for/list ([s (in-list '("a" "b" "c"))])
    (future (Î» () (displayln (equal? s "b"))))))

 It seems to be an issue specifically with equal?, since displayln etc correctly displays the value. Further, eq? / eqv? seem to consistently return true (I assume since my example uses string constants). It's _specifically_ equal? that shows up false.
 
 Weirder yet, the result is eventually correct, for example:
 
 (for/async ([s (in-list '("a" "b" "c"))])
   (displayln s)
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b"))
   (displayln (equal? s "b")))
 
 Displays things like:
 
 ...
 b
 #f
 #f
 #f
 #f
 #f
 #f
 #f
 #f
 #t
 #t
 #t
 #t
 ...

 Both machines I tested on were multi core. First my laptop, late 2013 macbook pro, 4 cores. Then a Linux server with 40 cores / 2 sockets.

 A little more investigation with Robby's test program shows that this
 was introduced between 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, which is the release that
 introduced places to Racket.

 The problem is that `equal?` is not handled correctly as a
 future-blocking operation. Specifically, the `equal?` implementation
 within the VM returns its result represented as an integer (0 or non-0)
 instead of as #t or #f, and that doesn't always work for an operation
 that can block a future. As a consequence, the result of `equal?` gets
 lost.
 
 I've pushed a repair as 7318b1fd34.
 
 Thanks for the report!

 Peter,
 
 We're currently putting the finishing touches on Racket 6.6.
 
 It would be possible to include this fix into the upcoming release, but
 it would be more straightforward to leave it for Racket 6.7.
 
 Of course, the fix will be available in nightly builds starting
 tomorrow, so you can easily use a fixed version sooner than 6.7 (which
 should be released in the fall).
 
 So my question for you is: Are you ok with using nightly builds until
 6.7, or would it be better for you to include this fix in Racket 6.6?
 
 Thanks!
 
 Vincent

 I have already have cherry-picked the fix onto 6.5 (with printfs removed) and deployed that build. So, you can tell that I consider this bug severe based on the action I've taken. Do what you think is best, if the patch doesn't go in to 6.6 I'll just make another patch build. :)

 Wouldnâ€™t a nightly build (these will have the fix) be preferable to a patched 6.5?

 Yeah, but it might include other bugs that haven't been fixed yet for the release. For example, the two debug printfs in the patch fixing this bug. I removed them myself for my build, and emailed Matthew about them. He removed one of them, and just now removed the other.
 
 In short, It's easier to personally audit the one patch I really care about than everything else on master since 6.5.

 Hmmâ€¦ if you trust the release process, you might at least consider applying the patches to 6.*6* rather than to 6.5, unless youâ€™re planning to use 6.5 foreverâ€¦

 Peter,
 
 Thanks for your input.
 
 We've decided to include the fix in 6.6, so you should be able to use
 Racket 6.6 as is, when it comes out.
 
 Thanks again for the report!
 
 Vincent
