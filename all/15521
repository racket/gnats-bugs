>Description:
I was not able to find any kind of instructions for installing DrRacket. The only thing being said is that "To get started with Racket, download it from the web page and install it."

I don't want to run any programs without knowing exactly what they are going to do, so the exact behaviour of the installation procedure should really be documented starting from how to start the installation in the first place, how to specify any settings and so on.
>How-To-Repeat:
Search DrRacket's docs for missing installation instructions.

 Thanks for your report. I can imagine a number of ways of helping you get what you want, but I think we’d need more information from you. Unfortunately, it looks like you’ve provided a non-working e-mail address. Can you provide a real one?
