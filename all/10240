>Description:
In the guide, section 16.1 (Pattern-Based Macros):

  (define-syntax-rule (define-get/put-id id get put!)
    (define-syntax clock
      (syntax-id-rules (set!)
        [(set! clock e) (put-clock! e)]
        [(clock a (... ...)) ((get-clock) a (... ...))]
        [clock (get-clock)])))

should probably be

  (define-syntax-rule (define-get/put-id id get put!)
    (define-syntax id
      (syntax-id-rules (set!)
        [(set! id e) (put! e)]
        [(id a (... ...)) ((get) a (... ...))]
        [id (get)]))) 

This is basically covered by Bug #10120.

-----

Additionally, there's a missing close paren in the prose before the definition of the clock macro:

"(as opposed to being a pattern variable" => "(as opposed to being a pattern variable)"
