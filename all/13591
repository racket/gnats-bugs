>Description:
In the documentation about Typed Regions there is a minor typo. It says 
"The [with-type] for allows..." but it should say "The [with-type] forM allows ..."

File: [plt] / collects / typed-racket / scribblings / reference / typed-regions.scrbl
Line: 14

- The @racket[with-type] for allows for localized Typed Racket regions in otherwise untyped code.

+ The @racket[with-type] form allows for localized Typed Racket regions in otherwise untyped code.
