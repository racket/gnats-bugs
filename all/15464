 For the most part, `raco test` just runs a module, and it's up to the
 module to act as a test and raise an exception or exit with a non-zero
 code if a test fails. There are two specific ways to communicate with
 `raco test`, though:
 
  * Use `test-log!`, where a false value indicates a failure. The
    `rackunit` forms like `check-equal?` Use `test-log!`.
 
  * Run `raco test` with `-e`, which makes stderr output trigger a
    non-zero exit code.
 
 Are you already using one of these techniques and it isn't working, or
 do you have different notion of test failure?
