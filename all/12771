  (yin yang))

2) Try to get it to indent correctly using tab or auto-correct. 

3) Replace the 'call-with-current-continuation' in the definition of 'yin' with 'call/cc' and try again. It works?!

 Could you please describe what you expect and what it does? 
 
 My version does fine with all three variants.

 I don't know how gmail indents, so it is hard to describe. But:
 
 (let* ((a add1)
        (b 2))
   (a b))
 
 In DrRacket, the open parenthesis for 'a' and 'b' are aligned. In the
 example I submitted,
 
 (let* ((yin
         ((lambda (cc) (display #\@) cc)
 (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c))))
           (yang
            ((lambda (cc) (display #\*) cc)
 (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c)))))
   (yin yang))
 
 'yang' should be aligned with 'yin' but it is not aligned. It is
 indented under the "lambda" like the first expression in an anonymous
 procedure. Auto-indenting or using tab does not align the identifier
 like one expects with a let expression. When I change to 'call/cc'
 
 (let* ((yin
         ((lambda (cc) (display #\@) cc) (call/cc (lambda (c) c))))
        (yang
         ((lambda (cc) (display #\*) cc)
 (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c)))))
   (yin yang))
 Then 'yang' can be aligned with 'yin' by using auto-indent or tab.

 I believe this should be closed. I was unable to reproduce it on
 another machine. Though I could not find anything in the indenting
 preferences for keywords that might have triggered the behavior---I
 looked through the list several times---on a hunch I reset them to
 defaults and indentation works properly. Not a bug. PEBKAC.
