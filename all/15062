 Oh, I'm trying a Linux build. I should try a source build...

 Does "/usr/local/share/racket/pkgs/.LOCKpkgs.rktd" exist, or is `raco
 pkg show` trying to create it?
 
 (I'm pretty sure that the installer should have created that file, and
 it does when I try the install, so I'm not sure what's going wrong.)

 The file doesn't exists, racket is trying to create the file. The workaround 
 which I use in the OpenBSD port is create manually the file.
