 Not sure where the actual bug(s) are.
 
 Is a url with a port but no scheme a valid url?
 
 But even if it's not the errors are not consistent. For example, if I
 replace the current string->url regexp contract with url-regexp (in
 net/url) then
 
 -> (string->url "213.92.8.7:31204")
 ; Invalid URL string; bad scheme "213.92.8.7": "213.92.8.7:31204" [,bt for
 ;   context]
 -> (url-scheme (string->url "google.com:80"))
 "google.com"
 
 
 Or maybe the bug is in the web server? The initial contract violation
 blamed a call to url->string made by read-request in the web server.
 Should the web server handle these invalid requests?
