 This is a bug in the Windows operating systems. DrRacket happens to trigger it but other programs could too. For a lengthy discussion, see

 This is potentially a different problem, since it looks like that
 version corresponds to windows 8, not Windows 10 creators update,
 which is the one with the problem we know about.

 Not positive why it's showing Windows 8. I have Windows 10 version
 15063.332. I haven't upgraded to creator's version on my PC and don't
 experience the bug there so I believe you're correct about the OS bug being
 the issue.
