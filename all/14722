>Description:
For some reason I thought that this was done, but I just noticed that
the documentation of `rename-in' is still completely omitting the fact
that it does let all of the unmentioned names through (un-renamed).  The
short text blurb doesn't talk about them, and even the example doesn't
show that.  IMO it would be good to have both a quick comment about
them, and to show that in the example.  Similarly, it would be nice to
also extend the example in `only-in' to show that an unmentioned name is
not there (it's only demonstrated for a renamed identifier).

BTW, the example is also using ()s instead of []s.
