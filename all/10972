>Description:
When running a compiled version of the mandelbrot.rkt benchmark in the collects/tests/racket/benchmarks/shootout directory (compiled with mzc or raco make ahead of time), I get the following error:

UNKNOWN: read (compiled): ill-formed code [../../../racket/gc2/../src/eval.c:12151]

 === context ===
/Users/stamourv/src/plt/collects/tests/racket/benchmarks/shootout/mandelbrot.rkt: [running body]


If no compiled version exists, it runs fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
cd $PLT/collects/tests/racket/benchmarks/shootout
mzc mandelbrot.rkt
racket mandelbrot.rkt 20
