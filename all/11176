>Description:
Breaking a setup (ctrl+c) shows the context of where the break happens.
The utility of this information is questionable -- but with a 4-core
parallel build, it's getting to obnoxious levels.

So one thing that I think should be done is to avoid that context
printout for user breaks.

But more than that -- I still shouldn't see N "use break" messages when
I abort a build.

 I find the context you get for a exn:break exception to be very useful
 on occasion when trying to find out what is going on with some long
 running computation or where something is blocked so I'd like it to
 stick around in general (altho swallowing it in the raco setup +
 control-c case sounds right).

 Sorry, I wasn't clear -- I agree that the context on breaks is useful
 in general -- just not in the setup case.
