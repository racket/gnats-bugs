>Description:
The inclusion of all the "main-distribution" packages causes a number of UX issues on https://pkg.racket-lang.org/search.

I think the common case will continue to be users who've done a "full" install of Racket. When they visit pkg.racket-lang.org/search, it will be to browse for other packages. Currently all the "main-distribution" packages overwhelm and obscure the other packages.

A separate but related feature request is to allow searching for packages that are NOT tagged X. If such feature already existed, then I'd suggest simply having the initial/default pkg.racket-lang.org/search page show things NOT tagged main-distribution.

 The NOT filter does exist:
 
 https://pkg.racket-lang.org/search/!main-distribution
 
 You just want it to be the default?

 Oh. Cool!
 
 (Although, how was I supposed to know that from the UI?)
 
 > You just want it to be the default?
 
 Yes, I guess that's it exactly.
 
 And I guess that's at least an answer to how people discover `!` --
 they might observe it in the URL.
