 I agree that drracket's stdout isn't a great place for it, but
 open-output-nowhere also doesn't seem that great.

 When clicking the run button, I agree that you want to keep the output.
 For check syntax (especially online), I don't think it's very useful.
 
 Optimization Coach has the same problem.

 Okay, I'll throw it away. I still think we could do better.
