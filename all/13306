>Description:
If DrRacket is not in Fullscreen, it maximizes the window when opening a new file in a new tab. This doesn't happen always, see the Description how to reproduce. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket, but not in full screen.
Disable "Open files in separate tabs (not separate windows)".
Create a new tab with file->new tab.
Open a file. DrRacket gets maximized.

If you close DrRacket, and start it again, the same bug may appear, or may not. 
So it doesn't happen always when opening a new file in a new tab, but it occurs regulary - I think in about a third of all DrRacket starts, when DrRacket is closed completely before.

 I've seen this too under windows. I don't really understand why, tho.
