>Description:
Running the "test.rkt" file in the example below causes an error stating
that the file "stuff.rkt" can't be found. It seems like the relative requires
of the reader submodule are being resolved relative to the directory that the
client using the #lang lives in.

Is this the right behavior?
>How-To-Repeat:
;; in some directory

;; main.rkt
#lang racket

(module reader syntax/module-reader
  racket

  (require "stuff.rkt")
  (displayln stuff))

;; stuff.rkt
#lang racket

;; doesn't matter what goes here
(provide stuff)
(define stuff 3)

;; test/test.rkt
#lang reader (submod "../main.rkt" reader)
