>Description:
When I run the PLT Games executable file and play Gobblet (4 x 4 version), I can place pieces on the board, but I cannot move any pieces that should be allowed to move that are already on the board except for the pieces in the first row. All pieces in the other three rows do not respond to mouse clicks even though they are "enabled," according to the system. When experimenting with the gl-board.rkt file, I noticed that, in the start-dragging procedure, it uses the pick procedure to get the object at (x, y). The problem is that it returns a space for the bottom three rows but properly returns the piece in the top row. Using the following expression before the conditional statement in the pick procedure, I was able to see the order of indices that were being returned:

(for-each (lambda (x) (display (gl-selection-record-stack x)) (newline)) results)

The indices that were less than the length of the spaces (indicating that it was a space) appeared first in the last three rows where they did not appear at all in the first row's searches. Since it always went for the first index in the list, it always returned the space, even though it should have picked the piece index that was listed after the space index. My fix was to just grab the second index whenever the first index indicated a space (whenever the results list length was greater than 1). Nobody else has experienced this problem who I know, but it seems to happen on this computer at least, for some reason. I even updated my graphics card and DrRacket.

 I cannot recreate this problem. I am skeptical that it could be
 computer specific.

unfortunately with some difficulty.
