>Description:
I tried making an executable out of a module with a "main" submodule and got the following error:

hash-ref: no value found for key
  key: '(submod #<path:/Users/cce/Desktop/bug.rkt> main)
  context...:
   /Users/cce/git/racket/collects/compiler/../racket/private/map.rkt:26:19: loop

   /Users/cce/git/racket/collects/raco/raco.rkt: [running body]
   /Users/cce/git/racket/collects/raco/main.rkt: [running body]
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following two lines to a .rkt file:

#lang racket
(module+ main)

Run "raco exe <filename>.rkt".
