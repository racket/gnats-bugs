>Description:
Renaming identifier after running check-syntax is messed up when the new name is of different length than the old and occurs several times on a line -- seems like computation of the positions of charaacters to replace is not correctly taking into account multiple occurrences on a line.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a BSL file put:

(define some 4)
(+ some some)

Run "Check Syntax"
Right-click on "some", choose "Rename ...", rename it to anything with more or less than 4 letters.
