>Description:
There is a typo in the docs about the R7RS conformance. Near the bottom of the page, it says "racket-report-environment" but it should say "scheme-report-environment".

File: [plt] / collects / r6rs / scribblings / r6rs.scrbl
Line: 397
-       or @racket[racket-report-environment] correspond to @|r5rs| bindings
+       or @racket[scheme-report-environment] correspond to @|r5rs| bindings
>How-To-Repeat:
See http://docs.racket-lang.org/r6rs/conformance.html , near the bottom of the page.
