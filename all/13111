 The currently nightly build includes a change that might fix the
 problem --- but we're not sure, because we haven't been able to
 replicate the problem. (If the change is on the right track, then we
 haven't been able to replicate the problem because it is
 locale-specific.)
 
 Can you try the latest version at
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 and let us know whether printing still misbehaves?
 
 Thanks!
