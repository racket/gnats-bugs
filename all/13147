 Specifically, if you start from a new DrRacket, open a blank file, and
 start typing, do you see the slowness? Can you send a screenshot and
 your preferences file?
 
 Also, more details about your computer might be helpful.

 Can you be more specific about your setup and how you're using
 DrRacket?  For most of us, DrRacket runs quite fast, so we'd like to
 be able to reproduce whatever is slow for you.

 Thanks for the reply!
 
 The green icon indicates that garbage collection is happening, so
 that's a good clue.
 
 Can you send me the exact content of the file that had the ~40 lines
 in, please? (DrRacket does different things based on what is actually
 in the editor that might be relevant here.)
 
 Your preferences file is named "racket-prefs.rktd" and it is in the
 "Racket" directory in the application-data folder as specified by the
 Windows registry; the application-data folder is usually "Application
 Data" in the profile directory.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Does it get faster again if you disable the 20,000-foot overview? (Ie
 type control-u for the menu shortcut to make the right-hand vertical
 thingy go away)

 Okay, thanks. Yes, perhaps.
 
 Just a shot in the dark: what is your local setting? Here's a website
 that tells you how to find it, I believe:

 Well, I'm not sure what to guess next. I feel pretty frustrated that I
 can't really debug this remotely.
