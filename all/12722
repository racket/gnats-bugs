 Based on where the build seems to get stuck, I think it is probably not
 stuck, but just taking a long time.
 
 We have fixed the problem for the next release. Meanwhile, in your
 partial installation, try
 
  bin/racket -l- setup -j 1
 
 to complete the install. This will likely complete faster, because it
 works around a problem that is triggered by parallel build.

 Hello,
 
 I do not fully understand what you mean.
 
 In the tarball there is not bin directory.
 and on /usr/bin there is no package racket because the compling of the 
 whole package is not successfull

 Sorry --- I forgot that `racket' is copied into place only after
 building bytecode.
 
 So, instead of the `bin/racket' line below, does it work to install
 with
 
  env PLT_SETUP_OPTIONS="-j 1" make install
 
 ?

 The process that builds bytecode is not driven by `make', and we don't
 know of a way to propagate the `-j' argument of `make' to the
 bytecode-building program.
 
 The `PLT_SETUP_OPTIONS' environment variable, then, is a way to push a
 `-j 1' through to the bytecode-building program.

 Can't I do the whole build again but then with make -j1 or configure -j1 ??

 I'm not really sure of the larger context and what those commands are
 supposed to do, only that the image is not as recent as some others we
 have made. Do you need an xpm file? I don't think that renaming a .png
 file into an .xpm will work, but I don't really know for sure.

 You should probably keep the .png suffix and change your
 "drracket.desktop" accordingly.  BTW, if this is for some package that
 will be updated on future versions, then keep in mind that we'll
 probably start distributing these (desktop, icon, etc) files in the
 near future.

 Oke,
 
 I will do that.
 And yes, I do these steps to make Racket avaible for Chakra Linux.
 Im the maintainer of Racket for this package.
 So thanks for the warning that these lines can be changed in the near 
 future.
