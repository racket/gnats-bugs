>Description:
Types defined as a union involving a struct are not correctly type-checked. Calling a function that has a parameter of this type, if the struct is used as an argument, results in a type mismatch error.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make a struct of any kind.
2. Define a new type that is a union of the struct and anything else
3. Define some function that requires a parameter of the new type
4. Attempt to call the function with an instance of your struct.

Example:

#lang typed/racket
(struct NumW([n : Real]))
(define-type MyType (U NumW Boolean))
(define (myFunc [x : MyType]) : MyType
  (match x
    [(NumW n) (NumW 0)]
    [b b]))
(myFunc (NumW 7))

 I can’t reproduce this on 6.8 (or 6.7). Specifically, it seems to type-check and run fine in my stock 6.8. Can you double-check, and include the error message that you’re getting?
