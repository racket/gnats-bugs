>Description:
A #land racket file with 2 comment boxes run fine in DrRacket 6.0.1. but after updating to 6.2. there appeared this new message  written in red in the lowest part of DrRacket window (below REPL). When I removed the comment boxes from the file, it run ok without displaying this message. 

The message that appeared:

read-bytes: reader provided by (lib "comment.ss" "wxme") is not an instance of snip-reader<%>

Before updating to 6.2. this text said "Only pure text files supported".
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create file in DrRacket 6.0.1. starting with #lang racket and language setup for Racket.
2. Create a comment box with DrRacket's "Insert Comment Box", save file.
3. Run file in DrRacket 6.2.

 This bug has been fixed already (but probably will be included only in
 the release after 6.2.1, not in 6.2.1).
 
 Thanks for the report!
