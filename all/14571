>Description:
When scrolling left and right in the timeline and future tree views of the "Futures Performance" window, the display is updated only after you stop moving the scroll bar and it often lags a few milliseconds behind when the scroll bar stops moving.
>How-To-Repeat:
I created a gist at https://gist.github.com/5038fc088f27939800be

The racket file expects the `test` file to be given on stdin, and it will generate an instance of the "Futures Performance" window. When I scroll left/right in the timeline it's slow to update.
