>Description:
When I hit f1 on something with non-ascii, I get sent to what appears to be the correct url, but the search box contains a mangled version of the characters and the search doesn't work. 

If I copy the correct thing from the url down to the search box, the search again works correctly. 

For example, imagine you're search for lambda; you'll go to this url:

file:///C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Racket/5.1.2.3/doc/search/index.html?q=%CE%BB

(which, in my firefox, renders as a lambda) but you'll see this:

Î»

in the search field, which is an I with a circumflex and a >> aka:

(bytes->string/utf-8 #"\303\216\302\273")
