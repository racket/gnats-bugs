>Description:
Currently the type of the values primitive does not have any filter or path information. It sortof works correctly because there are special cases for it if it is in application position.

The following program doesn't type check, but does if values is substituted for v. It does work if v is bound to identity.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket


(define v values)
;(define v identity)

(: f (Boolean -> #f))
(define (f x) (if (v x) #f x))
