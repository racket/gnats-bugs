Reason>>> Yes. Please see the ffi library: 

http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/index.html

and the few helpers that are needed to specify the ABI on Win32

http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/winapi.html

As an example

https://github.com/plt/racket/tree/master/collects/mred/private/wx/win32

is a very large in-Racket interaction with the Win32 API.

Also, questions are best answered on the mailing list. Please ask there for 
more detailed help once you get started on the particular APIs you need to 
call.
