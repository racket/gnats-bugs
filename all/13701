 The result you see is correct (i.e., as intented):
 
  * A `begin' in a module body splices, so that the program is
    equivalent to
 
     #lang racket
     (define cc3 #f)
     ((call/cc (lambda(k) (set! cc3 k) *)) 9 8)
     (display "Do you catch me?\n")
 
  * Each form in a module body is wrapped with a prompt, so that
    `call/cc' captures a continuation that does not include evaluation
    of the rest of the module body.
