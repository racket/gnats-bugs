 The space en dash space rendering of em dash is intentional. It's based
 on advice I kept seeing when I was first working on Scribble's HTML
 output: lots of recommendations to typeset an em dash as a
 space-separated en dash.
 
 I don't remember the rationale given for the advice. I think the
 overall reason was that a separate-separated en dash rendered more as
 an em dash should, perhaps due to browser limitations.
 
 So, I could be convinced that we should change, but the current
 behavior is not merely an oversight.

 I suspect that was a reaction against the lack of a portable way of
 getting an em-dash, which meant people tended to instead write it like
 so--which was rather ugly since it rendered as two en-dashes.  (Or
 worse, as three.)  It looked better to offset it with space and a
 single dash.
 
 But now that there seems to be a portable way to specify it, that's
 what I use.  (&#151; also does the trick, but I don't know how
 standards-compliant that is.  Whereas &mdash; is pretty clear.)

 No, it wasn't as simple as that.

 As I try to remember, I think it had more to do with linebreaks. I see
 that Firefox on Mac OS X doesn't break a line after an em dash, instead
 pushing the word before to the next line.
 
 There are, of course, ways to suggest that the browser break a line
 without inserting space. That's another area of weak browser support,
 though, an so on. Since space-separated en dashes look about right,
 they are considered respectable in some parts of the publishing world,
 and they save you lots of browser-portability problem, the conclusion
 was that it's a good way to go, especially with relatively narrow
 columns.
 
 I don't claim to be much of an expert myself, and I may now misremember
 the details. I'm just trying to follow advice of people who seem to
 have thought about the issue.

 Would you consider space mdash space?
