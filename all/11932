>Description:
Stream-first on most empty streams gives a pretty nice 
error message.  On streams produced by ports, though, it's
much less helpful, and suggests a bug somewhere. See
steps to reproduce, below
>How-To-Repeat:
evaluate this program:
#lang racket

(with-input-from-string ""
  (lambda ()
    (stream-first (sequence->stream (in-port)))))

Get this error:

apply: expects type <proper list> as 2nd argument, given: #f; other arguments were: #<procedure:values>
