>Description:
Run the following slideshow program:

#lang slideshow

;; change this to 1 to remove the bug
(define SCALE 2.5)

(slide (scale (t "P") SCALE))

(slide #:layout 'top
       (vc-append (titlet "AAAAAAAAA") 
                  (titlet "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB") 
                  (t "M")))
(slide #:layout 'top
       (vc-append (titlet "AAAAAAAAA") 
                  (titlet "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB") 
                  (t "M")
                  (t "M")))

Go to the end (3rd slide).  Then go back to the second slide, and then to the third again.  The spacing between the 'AAA's and between the 'BBB's will change slightly.  Moving rapidly between slides 2 and 3 will make this apparent.

The first slide always renders the same, but it's presence is required to show the bug.  Additionally, if the `SCALE' value is changed to 1, the bug goes away.  The bug remains at values of scale such as 1.1 and 0.9, and the bug becomes harder to discern (but is still there) at 1.001.  1.0 behaves the same as 1.  

This bug does not appear on OS X.

 FWIW, similar symptoms have been around for some time with slideshow
 (and they are platform dependent (although probably font dependent is
 a more accurate characterization)). There may even be a PR about it.

 This happens for multiple fonts that I've tried, and had not noticed
 anything like it before GR2, so it might be something different.
