Upon invocation, drracket issues the following:

WARNING: bad bitmap #<path:/usr/lib/racket/collects/icons/plt-logo-red-diffuse.png>
continuation application: attempt to jump into an escape continuation

and freezes (without CPU consumption). No window is opened. /usr/lib/racket/collects/icons/plt-logo-red-diffuse.png is a valid PNG bitmap. If I replace it with any non-PNG image, then the splash with the progress bar is rendered for a fraction of a second, and then it bails out with the following message:

png_structp->C: expected argument of type <non-null `png_structp' pointer>; given #f

In the same time, gracket starts OK. (make-object bitmap% "/usr/lib/racket/collects/icons/plt-logo-red-diffuse.png") returns (object:bitmap% ...).

Mageia Linux has GTK+ 3.4.1 and GDK-PixBuf 2.26.1 (which uses a libpng15-based PNG loader).

 Racket uses libpng directly, and it's looking for "libpng12" or just
 "libpng", not currently "libpng15".
 
 If you add a symlink in Racket's "lib" directory that is named
 "libpng.so" but links to "/usr/lib/libpng15.so" (or wherever the
 library is), does that fix the problem?

 Matthew, thanks for your hints,
 
 If by "Racket's lib directory" you mean /usr/lib/racket - then putting a
 symlink there doesn't help. Neither does putting a libpng.so ->
 libpng12.so.0 symlink into system libdir (/usr/lib). strace shows that
 DrRacket opens /usr/lib/libpng15.so.15 first, and
 then /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0. I previously had a
 symlink /usr/lib/libpng.so -> /usr/lib/libpng15.so.15 (installed by
 libpng15-devel package), but removing it didn't help either.
 
 However, I've managed to run DrRacket successfully with
 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpng12.so.0. In the latter case, libpng12 is
 loaded first, and then goes libpng15.
 
 Seems like Racket is not fully compatible with Mageia's libpng15
 (1.5.10). I'll appreciate any considerations on how to workaround this
 and to finally have Racket 5.2.1 included into the distro.
 
 Thanks! Dimitri

 Matthew,

 That /usr/lib/racket directory is formed by raco install; here's what is
 put to /usr/lib by raco:
 
 /usr/lib
 |-- libracket3m-5.2.1.so
 |-- libracket3m.la
 |-- libracket3m.so -> libracket3m-5.2.1.so
 `-- racket
     |-- buildinfo
     |-- collects
     |-- mzdyn3m.o
     `-- starter
 
 I've tried the following symlinks (to no success):
 /usr/lib/racket/libpng.so -> /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0.49.0
 /usr/lib/racket/libpng12.so -> /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0.49.0
 
 strace shows the following:
 
 [mitya@localhost ~]$ strace -e trace=open gracket -J DrRacket -l
 drracket/drracket.rkt 2>&1 | grep libpng
 open("/usr/lib/libpng15.so.15", O_RDONLY) = 6
 open("/usr/lib/libpng12.so.0", O_RDONLY) = 9
 
 and DrRacket doesn't start. Yet the only way to make it work is to
 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpng12.so.0. In this case, libpng12 and libpng15
 get loaded in inverse order.

 The problem is observed with our binary RPM builds. The packages are
 available from the "Core Updates Testing" repository for Mageia 2; you
 can enable it via drakrpm-edit-media or manually:
 urpmi.update --no-ignore "Core Updates Testing"
 
 Then you can install drracket package for testing. RPM spec file is
 available here:
 http://svnweb.mageia.org/packages/cauldron/racket/current/SPECS/racket.spec?revision=234767&view=markup
 But all it does is basically the standard configure / make / make
 install sequence.
 
 Thanks! Dimitri

 How about
 
   /usr/lib/racket/libpng.so -> /usr/lib/libpng15.so.15
 
 ?
 
 
 Or maybe it would make sense to just use a patch for commit
 466ffadb12, which fixes the problem more directly:
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/commit/466ffadb12c5488e65ccf95170c41cd224b2ca8f
 
 In retorspect, maybe the patch should try libpng15 first, instead of
 libpng12. Other Racet changes since v5.2.1 likely solve problems with
 using libpng15 and libpng12 at the same time, though.

 Matthew,
 
 Indeed, the problem was caused by libpng12 installed together with
 libpng15. After removal of libpng12 DrRacket was able to start. I've
 applied your patch, it fixes the issue even in the case of parallel
 libpng{12,15} installation. Bug 12727 seems to be fixed as well. The
 packages have finally landed in the repositories, and Racket 5.2.1 will
 be hopefully included into Magiea 2.
 
 Thanks! Dimitri
