>Description:
Racket enters an infinite loop when it tries to (read/parse/???) this expression:

    (quasisyntax (unsyntax 1 2))


I believe `unsyntax` should never be applied to more than one argument, but supposing this happened somehow by accident, it seems Racket shouldn't enter an infinite loop and chew up memory (in a minute or two it had used 3GB of RAM on my machine).
>How-To-Repeat:
echo "#lang racket\n(quasisyntax (unsyntax 1 2))" > /tmp/foo.rkt && racket /tmp/foo.rkt

Alternatively, type

    (quasisyntax (unsyntax 1 2))
