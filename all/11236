>Description:
Trying to render a 1-pixel rectangle on the screen using 2htdp/image fails in certain
cases. Rendering of other odd pixel images are also inconsistent.

Our hypothesis is that this is due to the image being aligned at a
half-pixel, which causes the image to be truncated at a pixel
boundary. In the case of the 1-pixel rect, it just gets truncated
to nothing.

This is a problem because 2htdp has exercises (e.g. exercise 63) that use 1-pixel
images, which have been disappearing in the output of functions students write for
homework.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is a minimal example which fails on my computer:

(place-image (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red") 50 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))

and this succeeds (renders as expected):

(place-image (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red") 50.3 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))

this succeeds (displays a red line between two pieces of text):

(require 2htdp/image)

(beside
   (text "foo" 11 "black")
   (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red")
   (text "bar" 11 "black")))

while this fails (just text):

(beside
   (text "foo" 10 "black")
   (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red")
   (text "bar" 10 "black")))

These two (note the three pixel rectangle) are rendered differently:

(place-image (rectangle 3 20 "solid" "red") 50 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))
(place-image (rectangle 3 20 "solid" "red") 50.3 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))

 Thanks for the report! I've fixed the bug and plan to push shortly.
 
 As a meta comment, I think you don't want to use place-image to place
 pixels, since place-image is defined to place the center of its first
 argument at the coordinates given (in the second argument). Instead,
 you probably want to use overlay (or underlay).

 The change to fix this PR was something that affected how all polygons
 were rendered. I think that it was a holdover from when we were
 experimenting with different interpretations of coordinates (or before
 I really understood what was going on with coordinates, more likely).
 
 Anyways, everyone pls. watch out for other strange things now.... (the
 examples in the docs all look reasonable to me, but if anyone else
 wants to make a pass thru, that would be great.
