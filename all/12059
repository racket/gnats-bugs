>Description:
Hi,

get-slides-as-picts adds margins to slides when (set-margin! 0) is used.

In file "test.rkt":
<<<
#lang slideshow

(set-margin! 0)

(slide 
 (colorize (filled-rectangle client-w client-h) "blue"))
>>>

In file get-slide.rkt:
<<<
#lang slideshow

(require slideshow/slides-to-picts)
 
(get-slides-as-picts "/full-path-to/test.rkt" 1024 768 #f)
>>>


Evaluating get-slide.rkt shows that the picture has an added white margin on the left and top edges (and, consequently, the bottom and right edges are cropped).

This is easily seen when DrRacket is in white-over-black color mode,
or when selecting the resulting picture.

Adding (set-maring! 0) in top of get-slide.rkt does not change anything (but it shouldn't).

Thanks,
Laurent
