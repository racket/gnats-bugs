>Description:
If you select Edit > Keybindings > Show Active Keybindings ,
you must close the list of keybindings before you can go back to any other interaction window (the definitions window, the interaction window, or this (bug report form) window).

cf the Bug Report Form window:  I can have this window open and go back to the definition or interaction window at any time.

This is annoying, since I'd like to have the list of keybindings available when I am working.
