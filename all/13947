 What is the authority you cite for these design decisions?
 
 I'm not finding anything about either of these specifically in the apple
 human interface guidelines, but Apple's TextEdit app treats triple click as
 selecting a whole line, not a word.
 
 As for the behavior of hyphens, what you ask for matches TextEdit, but in
 Racket programs, most of the time hyphens are inside "words" (really:
 symbols) and this is why we have the behavior we have. It has been this way
 for more than a decade in DrRacket, I believe, and so it seems like a bad
 idea to change, as I expect many people are used to the current behavior.

 I didn't refer to any authority, I was suggesting a change (I marked it 
 as such,
 not a bug) that would make the editor easier to use.
 
 In TextEdit the word separator is space and it has the double click 
 behavior I suggest.
 Racket is a special purpose computer language editing tool and could 
 reasonably
 have slightly different behavior. The names in Racket are very often 
 words separated
 by hyphens, so it makes perfect sense (to me) to mimic the behavior of 
 TextEdit, but
 with hyphen taking the place of space. I like programming editors that 
 are syntax
 aware and make your life easier.
 
 Try out Emacs (on the Mac, or PC/Linux) on Lisp code and the mouse works 
 the way I suggest.
 
 You are right though that even in Emacs the triple click selects a whole 
 line.

 I see. Thank you for clarifying that this was a request. I misunderstood
 your original message.
 
 I found this (old) copy of the human interface guidelines that suggests
 that DrRacket's current behavior is the right one:
 
 http://dropbox.scripting.com/dave/misc/appleHumanInterfaceGuidelines.pdf
 
 with the possible exception that hyphen should be considered a word
 separator. Indeed, some 10 or 15 years ago, I believe DrRacket did that,
 but I found that making hyphen as a non-separator worked better, since I
 usually wanted to get an entire identifier when I double click on it (as an
 identifier is more logically a "word" in a Racket program, IMO). So it has
 been that way for a long time and I don't think we should change it now, as
 many people are, I presume, used to this behavior.
 
 Meanwhile, you can control how double-clicking works by making your
 keybindings file. Below is one that does what you want, I believe. (I've
 put more code than is strictly necessary, so you can maybe make other
 tweaks.)

Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2013 10:56:26 -0400

 I think that the proper thing to do is to distinguish words from
 sexprs, and clarify that a double-click does the latter.  (IIRC, the
 function names also have "word"s in them, which is bad choice.
 Consider also the fact that there are word-* functions that actually
 work on human words, so the terminology is inconsistent.)

 They work on something approximating identifiers, not (English) words or
 sexps (or actual identifier syntax for that matter). But they should all be
 consistent, at least in the keybindings dialog.

 I intentionally used "sexpr" rather than "a non-list
 sexpr-estimation", since double-clicking also selects list sexprs when
 use on a paren -- so as far as the usage goes, it is (an approximation
 of) sexpr selection...

 I did look at the list of keybindings and didn't see the double clicks
 there -- are they included?  In any case, I was referring to the use
 of "word" in function names.

 I thought you were talking about the use of the word "word" in keybinding
 names (that you'd find in the keybindings dialog). Those should all go thru
 the same path in the code and so should all be consistent with each
 other....
 
 Except I see "Complete Word". Probably I should remove the word "Word" from
 that one.
 
 And now I see that upcase-word isn't right, either. It seems to stop at
 hyphens.

 Yeah, I think that "word" should have a single meaning consistently.
 (And I now see that the name that I was talking about avoids the whole
 thing by describing the operation instead of the subject noun:
 
     (send keymap map-function "leftbuttondouble" "paren-double-select")
 
 )
