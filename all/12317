>Description:
Under Windows 7, DrRacket doesn't behave in the expected way when dragging the window to the left or right edge of the screen. (Snap-Feature)
In General, when doing this action, most Applications (including DrRacket 5.0.x) are resized to exact the half of the left/right screen.

That doesn't always work in DrRacket 5.1.x:
If the contour-view is enabled and the Name of the current open file is too long, DrRacket resizes not to the half of the screen, it takes more width, depending how long the file-name is.

Sample Image: http://www.dobretzberger.de/drracket-overlap-on-snap.png
>How-To-Repeat:
Enable contour-view, use a file with a long name and snap the window to the right. Take another window of DrRacket and snap it to the left. Then the 2 windows overlap in the middle.

 The issue is that the minimum width of the DrRacket window is more
 than half the size of your screen in this situation. I don't really
 see how to do too much better in general, but I did shrink the maximum
 size of the file popup in the upper-left portion of the DrRacket
 window, which should probably help in these exact circumstances (but
 it will not work if you were to, say, open the module browser in the
 window).
