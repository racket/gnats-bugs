I should be able to click on struct-out to see its binding in the following program.

#lang racket/base

(provide (struct-out x))

(struct x () #:transparent)

 Looks like something with the expander or a macro somewhere, rather
 than something with check syntax, I think. At least the program below
 seems to show no trace of struct-out and I think it would need to if
 check syntax is going to show anything.
 
 #lang racket/base
 (current-namespace (make-base-namespace))
 (define (show-origins stx)
   (let loop ([stx stx])
     (cond
       [(syntax? stx)
        (define ogn (syntax-property stx 'origin))
        (when ogn
          (printf "~s\n" ogn)
          (loop ogn))
        (loop (syntax-e stx))]
       [(pair? stx)
        (loop (car stx))
        (loop (cdr stx))])))
 
 (define stx
   (expand
    '(module m racket/base
       (provide (struct-out x))
       (struct x () #:transparent))))
 
 (show-origins stx)
 (syntax->datum stx)
