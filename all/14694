>Description:
I saw that Racket v6.1 for OSX@PowerPC is missing from download on http://download.racket-lang.org/ so the only way for me is building it from source.

Currently, the build fails:

raco setup:   ffi-lib: couldn't open "/racket-dev/racket-build/build/user/6.1/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib" (dlopen(/racket-dev/racket-build/build/user/6.1/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib, 6): Library not loaded: /Users/mflatt/bl/m32/dest/lib/libintl.8.dylib
raco setup:     Referenced from: /Users/powermac/Desktop/racket-dev/racket-build/build/user/6.1/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib
raco setup:     Reason: image not found)
racket pkg install: packages installed, although setup reported errors
make[6]: *** [packages-from-local] Error 1

I tried to dig more, and found that draw-ppc-macosx-2/racket/draw/libglib-2.0.0.dylib is broken by using hardcoded absolute path "/Users/mflatt/bl/m32/dest/lib/libintl.8.dylib" (in contrast to draw-i386-macosx-2/racket/draw/libglib-2.0.0.dylib):

So:
1) can you please update binary blob in submodule native-pkg?
2) can you provide a way to build all these native-pkg on my side, and not cloning any blobs?

 We need to fix the download page to clarify that the main "Racket"
 source distributions will work only for Unix variants. The page should
 also provide information on building on Mac OS X and Windows.
 
 To build for Mac OS X, build the "Minimal Racket" distribution, then
 run
 
     raco pkg install -i main-distribution
 
 to install the rest of the packages that are part of the distribution.
 
 (The problem is that the main distribution depends on platform-specific
 native libraries, which obviously can't be included in the source, and
 which are intended to be installed via the package system. The Unix
 distribution doesn't include any native libraries, so that's why a
 source variant of the main distribution bundle makes sense for Unix.)

 Download page is so minimalistic, isn't it "a feature"? Anyway, I didn't
 get the point of source releases at all. So I used git (origin/stable
 branch). And did "make installers" to make nice-and-pretty .dmg to share it
 with everybody (freedom 2) at the time PLT team suddenly (and silently)
 stopped providing downloads for OSX@PowerPC.

 Thanks, will try it.

 But I'm using Git repo. I already got that source tarballs are unusable for
 me.

 Sorry --- I completely misread your report. I agree that the PPC dylibs
 are broken, and so trying to install them as packages will not make any
 difference.
