>Description:
I disabled Optimization Coach in Preferences -> Tools, but the button still appears in DrRacket. Pressing the button when the tool is disabled causes an error:

send: no such method
  method name: launch-optimization-coach

  context...:
>How-To-Repeat:
Disable Optimization Coach in Preferences -> Tools and then press the button in DrRacket.
