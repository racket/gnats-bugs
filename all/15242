>Description:
I use Synergy to let me use a linux system and a windows one without a hardware KVM, where the physical mouse is plugged into the windows computer, and is sent to the linux system when it's active.

For some reason, DrRacket doesn't like the virtual mouse's scroll wheel - it works with every other feature (clicking, moving, etc), but doesn't scroll. When I plug a USB mouse into the computer, I can scroll using that mouse.

I can't seem to replicate the issue with only things attached to the Linux computer - plugging in the second mouse results in both scroll wheels working perfectly, and unplugging the physical mouse leaves the virtual mouse's scroll wheel equally nonfunctional.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use Synergy to connect a windows computer to a linux one.
Try to scroll down in any window with a scroll bar.

 Oh, and as a quick addendum to this, the scroll wheel works fine with every
 other Linux app, it's just that it doesn't like DrRacket for some reason.
