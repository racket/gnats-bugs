>Description:
The documentation says that anyone can inspect or create an instance of a transparent structure without access to the structure-type declaration. IIRC transparent structures can be inspected but not created in this case.

See: http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/define-struct.html#(part._prefab-struct)

"â€¢Transparent : Anyone can inspect or create an instance without access to the structure-type declaration, which means that the value printer can show the content of an instance."

 I think both statements are true actually. Here's an example:
 
   Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.1.
   -> (module ex racket
        (struct foo (x) #:transparent)
        (define a-foo (foo 3))
        ;; Note: does not export struct-type declaration
        (provide a-foo))
   -> (require 'ex)
   -> (define-values (st _) (struct-info a-foo))
   -> (define maker (struct-type-make-constructor st))
   -> (maker 5)
   (foo 5)
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 You are right. The docs are OK. Sorry.
 
 (Before submitting the bug, I tried with struct-type-info and failed.)

explain further.

 Thanks for the report anyway. Perhaps the docs can be clarified by
 pointing to `struct-type-make-constructor` or by providing more
 examples.
 
 I'll go ahead and mark this PR closed though.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
