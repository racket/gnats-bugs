>Description:
When searching for documentation using the "Search in Help Desk for...", the browser opens a new tab not displaying the local html file file:///Applications/Racket%20v5.3.4/doc/search/index.html
but a web page instead (the one of the Coursera course I am taking).
Happening on MacosX 10.6, with Google Chrome Browser.
I set the default browser to Firefox but it still point to the same page on Google Chrome.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. In DrRacket, type an expression, say (+ and try to have documentation on "+" by activating the context menu "Search in Help Desk for "+""

 I understood what was going wrong. I think was doing a mistake but actually
 I can't reproduce it now but I'll try to remember the message I had:
 When requesting for help with "Search for help desk for..." a warning
 window appeared saying something like
 "This file was downloaded from the site 'blah blah'. Are you sure you want
 to open it ?"
 And the choices were "Display this web page", "Cancel" or "Open", the first
 one being the default one. I always type "enter" to display the web page as
 I understood the Manual pages were displayed in the browser. Finally, I
 figured out that I could try "Open" instead, and that was the good solution
 to display the manual page... not really straightforward.
 Conclusion : I fell in an ergonomic defect.
