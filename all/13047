In src/startup.rktl line 583, map is not applied to its list argument.

(apply
 string-append
 (map (lambda (p)
  (format "\n   ~a" (unbox p))))
 (filter box? all-paths)))

Just a case of too many parens on the format line. startup.rktl is generated somehow so hacking it locally didn't immediately fix the problem.

 src/racket/src/startup.rktl isn't generated, but you need to rebuild
 the binary to see changes.

 I tried changing startup.rktl in my existing tree where I had done a 'make clean' followed by a rebuild. I also tried a modified startup.rktl in a completely clean tree. In neither case was the optimizer warning gone. I should have mentioned that the symptom here is a warning from the optimizer

 Oh, right. I forget exactly how this goes and I can't seem to find a
 relevant readme anymore. But you need to build something from the
 startup.rktl that then the regular build targets pick up. startup.rktl
 is mentioned in src/racket/src/Makefile, so you might try looking
 there. Sorry.

 There are directions in comments at the top of startup.rktl about 
 regenerating cstartup.inc. Just changing the source doesn't work.
