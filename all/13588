>Description:
See the reduction below.

I'm not completely sure what the main bug is here:

1. async-channel and sync/timeout aren't currently declared as types;

2. I don't seem to be able to declare async-channel as a subtype of evt;

3. the illustrated attempt to do so results in an error from the bowels of Typed Racket
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(require/typed racket/async-channel
              [#:struct (async-channel evt) ()]
              [async-channel-put (Async-Channel Any -> Void)]
              [make-async-channel (-> Async-Channel)])
(require/typed racket
              [#:opaque Event evt?]
              [sync/timeout ((U False Nonnegative-Real) Event * -> Any)])

=>
../../Data/LocalApplications/Racket/5.3.3/collects/typed-racket/typed-racket.rkt:40:4: syntax-local-value: not defined as syntax

 The real issue is that the require/typed didn't give you a good error
 message when you are trying to declare a substruct of evt. As for
 events not being supported in TR I have field PR13625,
 http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=13625 for tracking
 that.
