>Description:
Here's the given data definition:
;   Xexpr is one of:
;   – symbol?
;   – string?
;   – number?
;   – (cons symbol? (cons [List-of Attribute] [List-of Xexpr]))
;   – (cons symbol? [List-of Xexpr])
; 
;   Attribute is:
;      (list symbol? string?)
;   (list 'a "some text") is called an a-Attribute
;   and "some text" is a's value.

But this example fails:

> (xexpr? (cons 'html empty))
first: expects a value that is a list and a value that is not an empty, given '()

This works:

> (xexpr? (list 'html empty))
#true

Should those initial "cons" be changed to "list"?

 FWIW, xexpr? should not fail, either way.

 Thin about it: both are Xexpr with rather different denotations. -- Matthias

 Yes, of course. I see now that the bug was in the predicate and not
 the data def.
