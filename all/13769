>Description:
If you accidentally mix up the argument order in splitf-at, the error says:

expected: procedure?
given: #<procedure>
argument position: 1st

The argument position is correct, but the predicate is wrong. I think it should say expected: list? given: #<procedure>
>How-To-Repeat:
(splitf-at (Î» (arg) #t) '(1 2 3))
