>Description:
Running the "arithmetic.ss" example in redex/examples gives me this totally
cryptic error message:

could not find the dot binary

(ok)

Eventually, I remembered that 'dot' was a dag layout tool, and things made
somewhat more sense, though I still can't figure out whether redex is using
another layout tool, or whether it's faking the dot functionality.  I would
consider an error message like this:

"Redex could not find the 'dot' binary; will use alternate layout tool."

... or something else equivalent.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The bug was that I was calling the dot-button's callback function to initialize the GUI state (as the window opened), but that button also checks to see if dot is installed. So I pulled out the GUI init state into a separate function and then call that.
>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation. Nor would it have been a type error.

 FWIW, you can ignore that message. Its not actually an error. (It is
 only supposed to show up when you click on the button that actually
 uses dot ...)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:29:06 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

The message is still the same, but it now comes when you
click the button that invokes 'dot' so heopfully it is more
clear. If not, suggestions for alternate text welcome!
