>Description:
The redex tutorial contains a path to a directory, which for people who
don't compile it (most people) looks exactly as seen at:

  http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/redex/tutorial.html

That path is therefore meaningless.

The code should use `setup/path-to-relative' to produce a human-readable
independent path.
