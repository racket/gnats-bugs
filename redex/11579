>Description:
`cross' does not work with (some) languages that rely on `hide-hole'.

(define-language L
  (e (e e ...)
     x
     v)
  (v (λ (x ...) e)
     (cont (hide-hole E)))
  (E hole
     (in-hole L E))
  (L (v ... hole e ...))
  (x variable-not-otherwise-mentioned))

> (redex-match L (cross e) (term (cont ((λ (x) x) hole))))
matcher.ss: found two holes

Matching proceeds top-down as follows.

matching (cross e) against (cont ((λ (x) x) hole)) with prefixed crosses
matching (cross e-v) against (cont ((λ (x) x) hole)) with non-prefixed crosses
matching (cont (hide-hole (cross e-E))) against (cont ((λ (x) x) hole)) with non-prefixed crosses
matching (hide-hole (cross e-E)) against ((λ (x) x) hole) with non-prefixed crosses
matching (cross e-E) against ((λ (x) x) hole) with non-prefixed crosses
matching (in-hole (cross e-L) E) against ((λ (x) x) hole) with non-prefixed crosses
matching (cross e-L) against ((λ (x) x) hole) with non-prefixed crosses
matching (v ... hole e ... (cross e-e) e ...) against ((λ (x) x) hole) with non-prefixed crosses

The final match "finds two holes" by consuming (λ (x) x) with hole and hole with (cross e-e).

I think the fix might be for Redex to generate a compatible-context language that uses `hide-hole' annotations to hide all holes except the one consumed by the `cross' pattern. For example, the failing (cross e-L) production should change from

(v ... hole e ... (cross e-e) e ...)

to

(v ... (hide-hole hole) e ... (cross e-e) e ...)

or even (if it's easier to implement)

((hide-hole v) ... (hide-hole hole) (hide-hole e) ... (cross e-e) (hide-hole e) ...)

If you were to define the compatible closure context for e by hand, I think you'd end up with something similar.

Alternatively, Redex could stop trying to guess what `in-hole' means.
