 Huh? They are typeset like that.
 
 Eg:
 
 #lang scheme
 (require redex)
 (define-language mt)
 (parameterize ([rule-pict-style 'horizontal])
   (render-reduction-relation
    (reduction-relation
     mt
     (--> e ep))))
 
 > Standard (contextual) reductions should come with E[e] |--> E[e']
 
 Is this a change request for redex to typeset with clauses?

 Yes. Stevie ran into this and changed his private Redex copy.

 And the other half? I don't see any arrows going backwards.

 Perhaps "Redex type setting gets defaults for arrows backwards" means
 something else to you than it does to me.

 When I use where clauses and typeset them, I want local reductions to  
 use --> and contextual reductions to use |-->

 Okay, so the title of the pr and this comment "Local reductions shoud
 be type set as e --> e'" are nonsense, then?
 
 I somehow thought you were saying you'd see "e' --> e" or "e <-- e'"
 or something.

 Huh? "backwards" is conceptual not right-to-left

 I've checked this in, but using #:arrow instead of #:main-arrow.
