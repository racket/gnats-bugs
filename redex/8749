>Description:
language->pict causes the error "min: expects at least 1 argument, given 0" if a language has a variable-except clause containing newlines.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "mrpict.ss" "texpict")
         (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
         (lib "class.ss"))

(require (planet "reduction-semantics.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3))
         (planet "pict.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3)))

(define the-dc (make-object bitmap-dc% (make-object bitmap% 1 1)))

[dc-for-text-size the-dc]

;; Any newlines inside a variable-except clause cause an error:
(define simple
  (language [var (variable-except something
                                  anything)]))
(language->pict simple #f)

 On further investigation, it's not (necessarily) variable-except
 that's at fault.  It seems a newline in the right-hand-side of any
 production with only one alternative causes the bug.  Adding an extra
 alternative removes the error just as well as removing the newline.

 Thanks, Carl. These examples are already just great. Very helpful.
