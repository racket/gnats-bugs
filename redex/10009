Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme/base\n" #t))
>Description:
This program:

#lang scheme/base

(require redex)

(define-language lang
  [e any])

(define r (reduction-relation lang
                              [--> e #f]))

(define (tr* . t) (traces r t #:multiple? #t))

(tr* 1 1)

gives this error:
insert in pasteboard% (snip% without position case): expects 1 argument, given 3: #f 25 42.0
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
A check was missing from the initial construction of the snips for traces.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. THis probably would have been a type error, since likely the function in question would have returned an option type, but it was used in a place that expected only the "payload" of the option, after the NONE's had been filtered out.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 07 Jan 2009 11:32:24 -0500
