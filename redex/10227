>Description:
I'm still not sure how to solve the error that redex is
actually trying to inform me of, but there's a bad 
call to 'raise-syntax-error' in there, where #t is 
passed as the 'what' argument to ... some internal redex
function.  I gave up trying to fix it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this program:

#lang scheme

(require redex)

(define-language lamv)

(define-metafunction lamv
  foo : E  -> any
  [(foo hole)
   #f])

see this error:

raise-syntax-error: expects type <symbol or #f> as 1st argument, given: #t; other arguments were: "hole expected to stand alone or to have one argument"
>Fix:
The bad error message was transposed arguments somewhere. This was a contract and could have been a type error.

The other problem was old code that wasn't properly removed. I'm not sure if it could have been a type error, but it seems unlikely. It was traversals of syntax objects that had extra cases in them. But perhaps a right-hand side that should have been gone could possibly have been type incorrect.
