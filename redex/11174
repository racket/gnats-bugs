>Description:
In redex/gui:

1) There are multiple occurrences of things that should be typeset as code but are not.

#t, #f, expr, reduction-steps-cutoff, pred, term-node-children, term-node-parents, and term-node-labels.

2) Typos

"the colors specified colors"
"the coloring of the coloring of each window"
"when new terms is inserted"
"it is called when after"
"The traces library an instance"
"the same as to the traces functions"

3) The docs for `stepper' are confusing.

"This function opens a stepper window for exploring the behavior of its third argument in the reduction system described by its first two arguments."

The third argument is a) optional and b) a pretty printer.  I think it should be "behavior of its second argument in the reduction system described by its first argument."  Maybe?
