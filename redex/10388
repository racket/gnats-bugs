>Description:
I'm modeling languages with probabilistic choice and it would be nice if I could label the arrows in the traces graph by the probability of the transition.

For example, if my language has a (choose p M N) construct that steps to M with probability p and N with probability 1-p, then I'd like to construct my reduction relation with two clauses like:

  [r (choose p M N) M ,(string-append "L " (number->string (term p)))]
  [r (choose p M N) N ,(string-append "R " (number->string (- 1 (term p))))]

Or if I wanted a uniform-choice operator (uniform M ...), I'd like to say:

  [r (uniform M ... N L ...) N ,(string-append "U " (number->string (/ 1 (length (term M ... N L ...)))))]

 I won't be able to do this soon, but you could label the reductions
 just "p" and "1-p" and then hack redex to let you compute the edge
 labels on the fly from the source term and the current edge label.
 This would let you turn "p" into what p actually was. Ditto 1-p.

Responsible changed from "robby" to "clklein" by clklein at Wed, 18 Aug 2010 15:14:33 -0400
Reason>>> Blame me.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by clklein at Wed, 18 Aug 2010 15:14:33 -0400
Reason>>> This works in the latest git revision:

(define-language L
  ((M N) (choose p M N)

  (p (side-condition (name p real) (<= 0 (term p) 1))))
