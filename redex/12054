 I don't see anything unusual on OS X or Windows 7. Can you send a screenshot?

 I see the problem in a 64-bit build, too.
 
 My best guess is that it's a Cairo bug. The problem happens when a
 clipping region is set, text is drawn, the clipping region is changed,
 and something other than text is drawn --- for certain Win32-specific
 drawing destinations. It seems that a Win32-level clipping region
 installed by the text-drawing routine is sticky. I found a workaround,
 which is to reset the Win32-level clipping region explicitly when
 reseting the Cairo clipping region, and I'll probably push that
 workaround. But I don't understand why the bug would be Win64-specific,
 and nothing in the Cairo source looks suspicious.
