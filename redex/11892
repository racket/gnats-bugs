>Description:
Symbols that are quoted with vertical bars 
cause the redex highlighting of the Redex's 
stepper to select the wrong text.

It looks like it miscounts the width of symbols that need ||.
>How-To-Repeat:
Running this program demonstrates the problem.

#lang racket/base
(require redex)
(define-language L (e ★ (e e)))
(stepper (reduction-relation L (--> e (e e)))
         (term ★))

[If the use of unicode characters above is lost, try this but replace \star with it's LaTeX expansion.]

#lang racket/base
(require redex)
(define-language L (e \star (e e)))
(stepper (reduction-relation L (--> e (e e)))

 I see the problem if I replace the stars with |a'| but I wonder if I'm
 still missing something. What requires quoting in the stars example?

 Nothing, but someplace in the printer system seems to think the stars
 need quoting.

 Hrm. I tried a few more variants of the stars example, and I still
 don't see this behavior.
 
 Let's see if fixing the example with |'a| in place of star also fixes
 what you're seeing.

 Casey, are you on Linux?  The stars seem to behave correctly on Linux
 for me, but we saw the quoting on David's Mac.
 
 However, the problem with |a'| seem exactly the same, so that might be
 just as good.

 No, I tried on a Mac.

 OK, I'll look into it.

 I pushed a fix for the |a'| case, but I doubt it will fix the star case.
 
 The stepper's diff-highlighting writes symbols to a custom port which
 turns byte strings back into strings and counts their lengths. I don't
 know the first thing about string encodings, but I can imagine some
 platform-dependent thing going wrong here.
