>Description:
The redex traces function causes an internal 'values' arity mismach on
the following use of #:colors:

#lang racket
(require redex)
(define-language L)
(traces #:colors (list (cons "x" (list "red")))
        (reduction-relation L (--> any any "x")) '())

The #:colors argument seems to satisfy the contract given in the docs:

(listof
 (cons/c string?
         (and/c (listof (or/c string? (is-a?/c color%)))
                (Î» (x) (<= 0 (length x) 6)))))

But when run, it results in:

racket/collects/redex/private/traces.rkt:433:30: result arity mismatch;
 expected number of values not received
  expected: 6
  received: 7
  in: local-binding form
  values...:
   "red"
   "blue"
   "lightblue"
   "blue"
   "lightblue"
   "lightblue"
   "white"

Note that the error does not occur if the "x" strings don't match.

[This bug was reported to me by Ilya Sergey at ICFP.]
>How-To-Repeat:
Run:

#lang racket
(require redex)
(define-language L)
(traces #:colors (list (cons "x" (list "red")))
        (reduction-relation L (--> any any "x")) '())
