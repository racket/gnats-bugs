>Description:
PLT Redex's traces window indents s-expressions based on the width of each box and known PLT Scheme keywords.  This indentation is inappropriate for non-Scheme languages modeled with PLT Redex.

The boxes allow editing of code, but the code reverts to the original text and default indentation when the box is resized.

For the "Export as Postcript" and "Export as Encapsulated Postcript" menu options, it would be very useful to edit/indent code as needed for display, and have it stay that way while moving and resizing boxes in the window.

The code below shows an example of non-PLT keywords "module" and "interface".  They are indented the preferred way in the given code (each followed by a single form on the first line, with subsequent forms on separate lines).  PLT Redex does not format either this way; it formats each a different way, treating "interface" as a generic form and "module" as the PLT Scheme module form.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (planet "reduction-semantics.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3 26))
         (planet "gui.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3 26)))

(define lang (language))
(define rules (reduction-relation lang (--> "hello" "goodbye")))

(traces lang rules '((interface I
                       (defstub one () t)
                       (defstub two () t))
                     (module M
                       (defun uno () 1)
                       (defun dos () 2)
                       (export I [uno as one] [dos as two]))))

 Do the optional arguments to `traces' help?

 The optional argument [pp] is not currently documented; traces refers
 to traces/multiple, which refers to traces/pred, which refers back to
 traces.  From its contract, it appears to be a pretty-printer.  That
 could help, though I would prefer the ability to hand-edit the output
 (without losing changes at every resize).  This reduces the burden of
 writing a language-specific pretty-printer, and helps when an existing
 pretty-printer doesn't get a corner case quite right.
 
 I'll do what I can with [pp] for now, though; thanks for the suggestion.

 The word "traces" should be "stepper" in this sentence:
 
 "The pp argument is the same as to the traces functions (above)."

 Ah, thanks.  Also, the contract for [pp] is (pp-contract) in stepper,
 but written out in traces.  Since (pp-contract) isn't defined, this
 makes the discussion of individual arguments in stepper's
 documentation cryptic.
