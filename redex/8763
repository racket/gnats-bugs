>Description:
PLT Redex typesets (quote TERM) as TERM when found in a term context.  In this context, quote is a literal and should appear in the typesetting.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 06 Jul 2007 22:56:21 -0400
Reason>>> redex


State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sun, 08 Jul 2007 23:26:38 -0400
Reason>>> This is fixed in my version of redex, but not yet released.

I plan to announce the next redex release on the mailing
list, so you'll know when the fix is available.
