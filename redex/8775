>Description:
PLT Redex raises an error like the following:

adjust-spacing: new loc-wrapper's column is earlier than a loc-wrapper's column that appears earlier in the list: #8(struct:loc-wrapper "" 13 0 8 0 #f)

whenever a newline follows the ID in (name ID PATTERN), and the PATTERN is not indented far enough on the next line.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (planet "reduction-semantics.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3 18))
         (planet "pict.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3 18))
         (lib "mrpict.ss" "texpict")
         (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
         (lib "class.ss"))

[dc-for-text-size (make-object bitmap-dc% (make-object bitmap% 1 1))]

(reduction-relation->pict
 (reduction-relation (language)
   (-->
    (name foo
     ())
    ())))
>Fix:
The fix was to rewrite the adjust-spacing (which I had done for other reasons, actually).
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. Not a type error
