>Description:
I'm not sure if this is a documentation or an implementation bug.  Whichever, the behavior of ..._1 patterns doesn't match my expectations.  At the very least, I'd like to request a clarification in the relevant section of the docs.

Of particular note is the behavior one gets upon using ..._1 in a *template* instead of a pattern; it's not at all what I expected.

The comments in the file below should explain everything.

 Thanks for the report! #2 should have worked, and it does now (new
 version released to planet). That is, this one:
 
    (define-metafunction zip (language)
       [((variable_id ..._1) (number_val ..._1))
        ((variable_id number_val) ...)])

 PS: I believe there is a bug reporting system on PLaneT -- do you mind
 giving it a try with the next bug you find?

 Great -- thanks!
 
 (Oh, yeah, that *is* the zip function, isn't it?)

 I'm not seeing this -- where should I be looking?  Do I have to be logged
 in to access it?

 Jacob show it to me once, but I haven't see it since! I can't find it
 when I poke around either.
 
 Jacob?
