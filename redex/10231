>Description:
Certain redex errors don't include syntax information that is (I 
think) readily available.
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this program:

#lang scheme

(require redex/reduction-semantics)

(define r (reduction-relation (abc)))

... get this error message:

reduction-relation: expected an identifier for the language name 
in: #f

No syntax highlighting; my guess is that the expansion of 
reduction-relation needs to preserve syntax information
>Fix:
The macro was passing the wrong object to raise-syntax-error, but the object was still a syntax object
>Release-Note:
No type error or contract violation here.

Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN
