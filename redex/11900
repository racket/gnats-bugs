 The bug is that ipsep appears not to be a legal option for neato.

 I don't suppose that your neato is built properly? Ie, is this relevant?

 Well, it appears to be similar:
 http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=595084 .  So it looks
 like many systems won't have ipsep.  Would it be worth trying to
 detect that at runtime (before generating the menu)?
