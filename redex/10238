>Description:
The documentation for for extend-reduction-relation states:

If the original reduction-relation has a rule with the same name as one of the rules specified in the extension, the old rule is removed.

But if you extend a reduction relation with a rule that has the same name as an existing rule, both names appear when the extended reduction relation is passed to 'reduction-relation->rule-names'.

This becomes a problem when one tries to use union-reduction-relations, which errors with

union-reduction-relations: multiple rules with the name rule-name

I think the problem is in struct.ss:85, which uses append instead of something like union for the two sets of rule-names.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write two reduction relations. Union the extension of one (replacing an existing rule) with the other.
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, altho it could have been, if the contract on reduction-relation->rule-names had promised to not return a list with duplicates. It would have even had the right blame.

This is not a type error.

Reason>>> Fixed, but not yet released to SVN. 

Your analysis is exactly right. Here's a union function to
stick into your own version until I can check mine in (I'm
in the midst of other changes so I can't check in yet.)


(define (union la lb)
  (let* ([ht (make-hasheq)]
         [n 0]
         [add
          (&#955; (x)
            (unless (hash-ref ht x #f)
              (hash-set! ht x n)
              (set! n (+ n 1))))])
    (for-each add la)
    (for-each add lb)
    (map car (sort (hash-map ht list) < #:key cadr))))
