 Did you mean to include more code?

 Sorry, there also should have been a call:
 
 (render-metafunction do-nothing)
 
 I've got one more coming down the pipe, I'll make sure that all the  
 code in the buffer is copied.

 Sorry Stevie -- I don't see an easy fix for this one. For the
 meantime, I think the best thing is to write this:
 
 (define-metafunction unit-lang
   do-nothing : u -> u
   [(do-nothing (unit (import x_i ...)
                      (export x_e ...)
                      (define x_d e_d) ...
                      e_b))
    (unit (import x_i ...)
          (export x_e ...)
          (define x_d e_d) ...
          e_b)])
 
 Less than optimal, I know.

 No worries -- I'll do the rewrite.  Thanks though!
