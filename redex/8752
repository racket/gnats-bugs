>Description:
PLT Redex typesets a (name VAR PATTERN) as (name VAR PATTERN), and still adds "where VAR = PATTERN" below the containing pattern.  This is redundant; (name VAR PATTERN) could be replaced with VAR or the where clause could be removed.

(require (lib "mrpict.ss" "texpict")
         (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
         (lib "class.ss"))

(require (planet "reduction-semantics.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3))
         (planet "pict.ss" ("robby" "redex.plt" 3)))

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 16 Jun 2007 15:34:21 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed and released ot SVN.

I didn't release it to planet yet, but if you want to see
the change immediately, feel free to look here:

  http://svn.plt-scheme.org/svn/usr/robby/redex/redex

Note that this directory is not always working (sometimes I
just commit stuff when I head home and I'm still in the
middle of things). No need to submit PRs for that kind of thing.

If you want, I will release it to PLaneT.
