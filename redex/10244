>Description:
See Steps to Reproduce for the problem.
Replacing 'syntax-e' by 'syntax->list' at 1363:40 and 1515:41 in file redex/private/reduction-semantics.ss solves the problem. If I understand correctly, syntax-e can return a pair whose cdr is a syntax-object, even when the latter represents a list. IIRC in previous versions of PLT Scheme syntax-e did indeed return a list in this case.
All the best, Jos
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require redex)

(define-syntax define-predicated-language
 (syntax-rules ()
  ((_ language (non-terminal alternative ... pred) ...)
   (begin
    (define-language language (non-terminal alternative ...) ...)
    (define-metafunction language pred : any -> any
     ((pred non-terminal) #t)
     ((pred any) #f)) ...))))

(define-predicated-language grammar (‹term› any Term?))

for-each: expects type <proper list> as 2nd argument, given: #<syntax:8:4>; other arguments were: #<procedure:...ion-semantics.ss:1353:3>
>Fix:
Just as suggested in the PR
>Release-Note:
Not sure if this is a type error. Probably not, since syntax-e might be able to return a list and might return a pair of syntax objects, so probably the type system wouldn't have been able to catch that

(cdddr (syntax-e #'...))

is sometimes bad. 

This was a contract violation.
