>Description:
term-match/single expressions are not allowed to return multiple values, presumably so it easier to implement term-match and it with the same internal function. This should be at least stated in the documentation or changed.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require redex)

(define-language test
  [e foo])

(define test-fun
  (term-match/single
   test
   [any
    (values 1 2)]))

(test-fun 1)
>Fix:
The code that was generated assumed that a single value result was generated. It was a series of checks against the patterns where the one that succeeded used an escaping continuation to return the result. Now it returns a thunk that is then called in tail position.
>Release-Note:
The error was a contract violation and probably could have been a type error of the generated code, if there were a type system for macros somehow.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 05 Jun 2009 15:53:29 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.
