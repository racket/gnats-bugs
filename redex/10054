>Description:
If you have a rewriter for a metafunction and apply it to rendering the definition of that metafunction, it only affects the RHS.  This makes it difficult to show the definition of a metafunction that has been rewritten.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following code:

#lang scheme

(require redex)

(define-language core-lang
  (x variable-not-otherwise-mentioned)
  (e x (e e) (λ (x) e)))

(define-metafunction core-lang
  subst : e x e -> e
  [(subst x x e) e]
  [(subst x_1 x_2 e) x_1]
  [(subst (e_1 e_2) x e)
   ((subst e_1 x e) (subst e_2 x e))]
  [(subst (λ (x) e_b) x e)
   (λ (x) e)]
  [(subst (λ (x_f) e_f) x_a e_a)
   (λ (x_f) (subst e_f x_a e_a))])

(define (subst-rw lws)
  (list ""
        (list-ref lws 2)
        "{"
        (list-ref lws 3)
        ":="
        (list-ref lws 4)
        "}"))

(with-compound-rewriter 'subst subst-rw
  (render-metafunction subst))

 It looks like the following diff fixes the issue:

 I would apply it directly, but I wanted to make sure there's not some  
 reason that is the way it is first.

 That looks right to me.
 
 Can you add a test to private/bitmap-test.ss too? (Or else I'll do it
 all, no problem.)

 Sure, no problem.  The only issue I have is that if I output the pict =20=
 
 in DrScheme, then right click and do "Save image..." to save it to a =20
 PNG, the test fails because of a slight difference on the right and =20
 bottom sides of the image (I think it has an extra row and column of =20
 white pixels).  Is that what you do, or should I be saving the image =20
 in a different way?
 
 (The extra test code is below, if you want to just use it directly.)

 Nevermind, I just tried out the "Save" button on the testing GUI and  
 that seems to have saved it appropriately, so I'm checking it in now.

 Right. that's what the save is for. Sorry I wasn't clear. I should
 have also said that it is really the test case that matters more than
 making sure it passes (that's easy for me to do).
