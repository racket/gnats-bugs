>Description:
This program:

#lang scheme

(require redex)

(define-language lang)

(define-metafunction lang
  m : any -> any
  [(m x) x])

(term (m x))

draws a check-syntax arrow between the two occurrences of `lang', but not between the occurrences of `m'.  It would be nice if the additional arrows were drawn - it would enable renaming of metafunctions, for example.
