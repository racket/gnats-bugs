>Description:
I have a language SL that is an extension of TL. The extension adds a new expression form. In TL, I define a substitution function, subst-e.

Currently, I can use define-extended-language and extend-reduction-relation to define SL's grammar and reductions.
(BTW, extend-reduction-relation requires the redefinition of alternative arrows.)

I expected that define-metafunction/extension would work the same way: defining an extension to subst-e that would work for SL's e and TL's e. But, I must give it a new name, which means that TL's reduction relation won't use the extension, so I have to actually the reduction and I get to the point of wondering what good extend-reduction-relation even was.

I might be able to reorganize things to make it work anyways, but this was an annoyance that I thought I'd record in a bug report.

 In the short term, assuming that the extended language doesn't
 introduce any binding forms, you might try a strategy in the
 substitution function here:

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "clklein" by clklein at Fri, 04 Dec 2009 12:51:41 -0500
Reason>>> Matthew has asked about this too. I'm planning to improve
the extension forms in the not too distant future.



State changed from "open" to "closed" by clklein at Wed, 20 Oct 2010 19:51:08 -0400
Reason>>> I think this is fixed now.
