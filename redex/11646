>Description:
When I'm viewing a large reduction graph, trying to two-finger scroll vertically or horizontally on my laptop trackpad does nothing.

This is a repost of #10389, which was closed as "obsolete". The bug still exists in the latest git (>=5.0.99.6), so it's not obsolete.
>How-To-Repeat:
In either DrScheme or MrEd, expand a large reduction graph in the traces or stepper window and try to scroll with a trackpad (or mousewheel, probably).

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by clklein at Thu, 31 Mar 2011 14:48:14 -0400
Reason>>> The underlying GUI library doesn't currently support
horizontal mouse-wheeling.

Reason>>> racket/gui now supports horizontal mouse-wheeling, thanks to
Matthew and Eli.
