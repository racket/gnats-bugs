>Description:
The docs give:

(define-metafunction/extension extending-name language-exp
  contract
  [(name pattern ...) term (side-condition scheme-expression) ...]
  ...)

But this is missing the name of the metafunction being extended.

Seems it should be:

(define-metafunction/extension extended-name extending-name language-exp
  contract
  [(name pattern ...) term (side-condition scheme-expression) ...]
  ...)

 Actually, the suggested syntax I have is wrong -- I think the issue is 
 not the grammar given, but the description.  It's not clear that 
 `extended-name' is the name of the existing metafunction.  And this 
 doesn't make it any clearer:
 
 The extended metafunction behaves as if the original patterns were in 
 this definitions, with the name of the function fixed up to be 
 extending-name.
 
 A simple example would help.
