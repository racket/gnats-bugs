Unsure if this is a software bug, documentation bug, or intentional design. The program below fails during the second test case. I expect all the tests to pass. If I use the currently commented-out definition of mf+ instead, exhaustively guarding the catchall clause, things work as expected. Have I misunderstood define-metafunction/extension?

 Coincidentally, I was already working on this bug when your PR arrived
 in my inbox. Expect a fix soon.

 I believe this is a bug that Casey is currently in the middle of
 fixing, amusingly enough.
