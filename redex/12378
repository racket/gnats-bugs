>Description:
Here's an example extending to the subtype relation example from the docs to function types 
with multiple inputs, but it doesn't work, complaining about a missing ...:

#lang racket
(require redex/reduction-semantics)

(define-language types
  ((τ σ) int
         num
         (τ ... → τ)))

(define-relation types
  subtype ⊆ τ × τ
  [(subtype int num)]
  [(subtype (τ_1 ..._1 → τ_2) (σ_1 ..._1 → σ_2))
   (subtype σ_1 τ_1) ...
   (subtype τ_2 σ_2)]
  [(subtype τ τ)])


However it works fine as a judgment:

(define-judgment-form types
  #:mode (subtype I I)
  [(subtype int num)]
  [(subtype (τ_1 ..._1 → τ_2) (σ_1 ..._1 → σ_2))
   (subtype σ_1 τ_1) ...
   (subtype τ_2 σ_2)]
  [(subtype τ τ)])

(judgment-holds (subtype (num num num → int)
                         (int int int → num)))
