>Description:
The docs for #:attempt-size could benefit from some calibration to say what are interesting values. It says that the number grows logarithmically, but it would be nice to know what the values range over for, say, when you have 1000 attempts.

In particular (and maybe I shouldn't think that way), I'd like to cut down to only 100 attempts for a test file, but I'd like to not just try the base cases over and over. So I thought I should set #:attempt-size to something. But I'm not sure what.

Also, there is a bug. This program:

#lang racket
(require redex)
(define-language L)
(redex-check L number #t #:attempt-size 100)

produces this:

Language: racket [custom]; memory limit: 256 MB.

 Not as nice as you'd think. The rationale leading to the current
 default was something like this: "The number of trees grows
 exponentially, so the bound should grow logarithmically. Oh, right, I
 need a base. How about 5?"

 ng. But I'm not sure what.
 
 I would probably use something like this function
 
 (=EB (i)
   (cond [(<=3D i 5) 0]
         [(<=3D i 15) 1]
         [(<=3D i 25) 2]
         [(<=3D i 45) 3]
         [(<=3D i 75) 4]
         [else 5]))
 
 but you should probably experiment with `generate-term' to see which
 examples you tend to get at each size.

 I'll fix this.
