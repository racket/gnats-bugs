>Description:
Looking at the grammar for pattern in the 
first section of the redex.scrbl documentation,
the first three productions I see are:

 any, in bold teletype
 number, in normal teletype
 string, in blue teletype, hyperlinked to the string procedure

From reading the English text of the documentation,
all three of these productions denote the
the corresponding literals; they're all on 
"the same footing."  But this grammar  
would mislead a person unacquainted with Redex; 
one wastes time trying to infer why "any" is 
in bold and why "string" is in blue.  
(e.g. "Perhaps the bold "any" denotes the literal 
symbol 'any, while the unbold number is actually
 a nonterminal that goes to any number?)

(The English text does clear all this up a lot,'
which is why I'm only filing this as a 
non-critical bug.)

 I was using @schemegrammar[] with a literals list, but that's wrong.
 
 I'd like to see output where the non-terminals look different than the
 literals in the grammar, ie:
 
   pattern =3D any | number | (pattern ...)
 
 where "pattern" looks different than "number" or "any", but neither
 use @scheme[]. Is that possible?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 11 Mar 2009 07:48:49 -0400
Reason>>> For now, I've just made everything have the same font (ie
'pattern' is in the same font as 'any'). I'm not sure how to
do better without changing @schemegrammar[].

 Correct me if I'm wrong: 'pattern' is analogous to a non-terminal and  
 'any' is analogous to a terminal, and the change above is saying that  
 the two are no longer distinguished in the grammar, right?
 
 If the two are not going to be rendered differently anymore, perhaps  
 you should  adopt the common textual convention of wrapping non- 
 terminals in angle brackets, ie:
 
 <pattern> = any | number | string | variable | \cdots
 
 <pattern-sequence> = <pattern> | <ellipsis> | <ellipsis>_<id>
 
 <ellipsis> = ... ; literal ellipsis
 
 ----
 
 Or an alternative convention that would match Matthias' current style  
 of writing data definitions would be to capitalize the first letter  
 (or use CamelCase) for non-terminals, ie:
 
 Pattern = any | number | string
 
 PatternSequence = Pattern | ... | ..._Id
 
 ----
 
 Basically I am concerned that my bug report has done more harm than  
 good (to the utility of the grammar).  But maybe I am misinterpreting  
 your message above, and non-terminals and terminals are going to  
 continue being distinguished in the scrbl renderings.

 Thanks (and sorry it took me so long to reply). I went with the angle
 brackets thing and it looks much better now.
