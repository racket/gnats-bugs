#                   submitters database for GNATS
#
# Any line which begins with a `#' is considered a comment, and GNATS
# will ignore it.
#
# Each entry has the format:
#
#       submitter:full submitter name:type:response-time:contact:notify-others
#
#       * submitter: The name of the site, customer, etc., sending the
#         report in.
#       * full submitter name: The description, like `Foo Widgets Inc.'.
#       * submitter type: Can be contract type, level of expertise, etc.
#       * response time: If the database dbconfig file has the
#         notify-about-expired-prs entry set to true, GNATS will use this
#         field to schedule when at_pr should notify the gnats-admin,
#         responsible person and submitter contact that the PR wasn't
#         analyzed within the agreed response time.
#       * contact: Principal contact for the submitter.
#       * notify: Others who should be Cc'd on any submitted PRs coming from
#         this submitter.  These people are only notified when a PR is 
#         initially created, not on edits.
#
# The submitter contact: and notify: fields are mapped through the responsible
# file when trying to determine email addresses.
#
# The first submitter entry in the file is used as the submitter
# for PRs with invalid/empty submitter fields.  None of the fields have
# any special meaning (in particular, the "unknown" name isn't explicitly
# referred to) and can be changed to any desired value.
#
# PLT: the contact email is used by Gnatsweb to send emails (for interested
# parties), we want these emails to go to bugs@racket-lang.org so they are
# registered and not to gnats-admin.

# Sample submitters:
#
# For the submitter `foo', we will know that they have a "six-month"
# contract, and that `joe' is the person who should worry about PRs
# coming from Foo Widgets Inc.  There is no reply-time.
#foo:Foo Widgets Inc.:six-month::joe:
#
# For the submitter `dod', they have a "DARPA" contract and `bill' is
# to be given a copy of the PR, in addition to whomever might be
# responsible for the category the PR was filed under.  There is a
# four-hour response time, and that `al' should also get a copy of the PR.
#dod:Department of Defense:DARPA:4:bill:al
#
# A `test' submitter, for send-pr and general GNATS testing.
