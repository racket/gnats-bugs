#	Use this file to store mappings between sender's email addresses
#	and submitter IDs.
#
#	Entries are of the form:
#
#submitter-id:address-fragment
#
#	where submitter-id is a valid submitter ID, and address-fragment
#	is a full or partial e-mail address.  Fragments are compared to the
#	end of the "From:" header of a Problem Report in an attempt to
#       identify the submitter based solely on email address.  

#	The string matched is merely user@host portion of the From: header,
#	it does not contain any other text (such as <> or the full name 
#	portion of the address).
