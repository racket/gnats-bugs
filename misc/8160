 Hi,
 
 There's a note about conflicts in the SRFI documentation, but the note
 is not as easy to find as it should be.
 
 Below is an extract from the documentation in collects/srfi/doc.txt ---
 which is the last link you get when you search for "SRFI" in Help Desk.

 NOTE on SRFIs with name conflicts
 ---------------------------------
  
 Certain SRFIs (currently SRFIs 1, 13, 19, 43, 45, 48 and 69)
 provide names which conflict with names provided by the
 'mzscheme' language.  Attempting to require one of these SRFIs in
 a module written in the 'mzscheme' language will result in an
 error.
  
 To address this problem, the PLT implementations of these SRFIs
 provide a different module which renames the problematic exports
 to avoid these conflicts.  For SRFI 1, this library is called
 list.ss, and should be required like this:
  
                     (require (lib "list.ss" "srfi" "1"))
  
 which supplies the colliding names with a prefix of 's:'
 (e.g. "s:map", "s:reverse!") and is therefore suitable for
 requires in a module.
  
 For SRFI 19, this library is called time.ss, and should be
 required like this:
  
                     (require (lib "time.ss" "srfi" "19"))
  
 which supplies the colliding names with a prefix of 'srfi:'
 (e.g. "srfi:date?", "srfi:date-second") and is therefore suitable
 for requires in a module.

 Will it be better to add the text to the srfi main doc page?  If so,
 Chongkai -- can you add some text there?
