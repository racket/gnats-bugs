 It appears that no one replied to your problem report. If not, we're
 sorry about the delay.
 
 I've pasted in the relevant part of the DrScheme FAQ, which is at
 http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/doc/drfaq/node7.htm:
 
  I have successfully downloaded the installer program for Windows, but
  the installation fails. Why?
 
  If the installer reports a message such as ``corrupt installation
  detected'', the real problem may be that the installer is unable to
  write the DrScheme files to your hard drive, or the installer may be
  unable to modify the Start menu. In this case, check to make sure
  there is disk space available, or contact your system maintainer to
  make sure that you have the appropriate access priviledges.
 
 If that doesn't answer the question, please let me know.
 
 Matthew
