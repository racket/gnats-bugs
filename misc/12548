Same story as the last few: planetcute has all png file paths in

  collects/teachpack/2htdp/scribblings/compiled/planetcute_scrbl.zo

Filing separately since I don't know if it's the runtime-path that doesn't
work for .png paths, or the bitmap thing, or something else.

 I can fix the problem below, but the 'bitmap' syntactic form is
 generally going to insert an absolute path when it gets used with a
 string argument. Is that a problem? Or does it just mean we need to
 avoid using that form of 'bitmap' in our source code?

 There are two ways to resolve these problems -- when the path needs to be
 displayed (as in error messages, documentation, etc) there's the module
 that shows the prefix in a human readable way.  That's the one from the
 other PR.  And yes, this is imprecise, but in most cases (as in rendering
 error messages) it is impractical to include an expression that evaluates
 to the path.
 
 The other case is when you need to actually refer to the file, and IIUC
 that's what happens here.  The solution that you committed looks like it is
 in the right direction (I'm on the iphad so can't look properly), but
 there's a library just for these cases.  It's in setup and I think hat
 there's a "relativize" somewhere in it's name.  It should really be used as
 the central point for these things.  Two things that it deals with is any
 kind of path (it looks like you're just giving up on them) and it uses byte
 strings for the marshaled relative representations (iirc, strings could
 lose information, which is why we went withe them).  I can revise your fix
 when I get home later.
