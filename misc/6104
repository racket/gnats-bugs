>Description:
Using: 203.2-cvs29jan2003 on OS X 10.2.3
While evaluating statements in HtDP Exercise 6.2.1, the following commands don't accept the optional(?) color:
draw-solid-rect, draw-circle, draw-solid-disk

This causes drawing code in section 6 of HtDP to break.

The problem appears to be located in big-draw.ss (or error.ss, depending on your perspective). The check-arity function is called with one less than the required arity when a color argument is added. Perhaps check-arity should be changed to have min- and max-arity arguments.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Load the draw.ss teachpack.
2. Execute.
3. (start 300 300)
4. (draw-circle (make-posn 150 150) 50 'green)
[Failure occurs here.]
