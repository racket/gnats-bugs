>Description:
The HTML documentation on

    http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/299.100/html/mzlib/mzlib-Z-H-40.html#node_chap_40

refers to

    make->vector

when in the code, it's really

    make-->vector

with two hyphens.  I haven't looked too closely at how TeX2page does this, but I suspect it's a funky interaction with how TeX defines different kind of hyphens (- vs -- vs ---).

Oddly enough, the PDF at:

    http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/299.100/pdf/mzlib.pdf

does not have the hyphen bug in it.
