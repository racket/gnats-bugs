>Description:
The documentation for the reduction special form contains an example which contains the following code fragment:

(foldl (lambda (term var arg) (lc-subst x arg term))
       body
       args
       xs)

Several problems here.  First, the order of the args to the lambda is wrong.  For foldl in (lib "list.ss"), they should be (lambda (arg var body) ...)

Second: The `x' in the body of the lambda is free; it should be `var'.

Third: This isn't a bug, but why not just do the obvious eta reduction and say (foldl lc-subst body xs args) ?

 (require (lib "list.ss"))
 
 (foldl (lambda (arg x body)
          (printf "arg ~s x ~s body ~s\n" arg x body)
          body)
        'body
        (list 'arg1 'arg2 'arg2)
        (list 'x1 'x2 'x2))
 
 prints out:
 
 arg arg1 x x1 body body
 arg arg2 x x2 body body
 arg arg2 x x2 body body
 
 which would seem to indicate that the docs have (that part...) right.
 
 What test did you run? Perhaps the docs for foldl aren't right?

 Lo, on Thursday, January 30, Robert Bruce Findler did write:

 The docs don't match your example above.

 Maybe I'm going off an old version of the docs for the reduction
 semantics collection, but the help desk currently installed on denali
 has the following:
 
    (foldl (lambda (term var arg) (lc-subst var arg term))
           body args vars)
 
 According to the docs for foldl and my experience (and the code above),
 the accumulator (`init' arg) is the *last* value passed to the function,
 not the first.  My example needs to be
 
    (foldl (lambda (arg var term) (lc-subst var arg term))
           body args vars)
 
 instead.
 
 As far as I can tell, the docs for foldl/foldr match the current
 implementation.

 Ah, right you are. Sorry for the confusion. I've updated the docs.
