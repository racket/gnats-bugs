The bug-report form window has a "Help" menu that's empty, 
both in DrScheme and in stand-alone Help Desk.

The "New", "Open", and "Open Recent" menus items do noth 
(except produce errors) in stand-alone Help Desk.

 While I was there, I tried fixing this too, but didn't see any way of
 doing it:
 
 * Trying to use a basic framework frame gives me a completely blank
   menu-bar.
 
 * I tried overriding `get-menu-bar' to return false, got one exception
   from framework/private/framework.ss that assumes that there is
   always a menu-brar, fixed that -- and still had an empty space for
   the menu.
 
 * Finally, I tried making the dialog be a simple dialog%, which looks
   very reasonable -- but things like C-w don't work.
 
 I think that the last solution was best, but don't know if you'll want
 it given that it ignores the standard keys.  If you think it's fine,
 I'll commit.  (Or if there's a way to get the standard keys in, or a
 single `Edit'-only menu.)

 You want a frame that has the basic menus, not one without, I think.
 
 There is a mixin in DrScheme that provides the drscheme-specific menus
 (opening a new drscheme window, for example) and you should be able to
 use frame:standard-menus-mixin to get the basic menus (you will need to
 provide callbacks for the some of the menus).

 This is what it basically did...:
 
   (remove-extra-blanks (frame:standard-menus-mixin frame:basic%))
 
 with:
 
   (define/override (file-menu:between-print-and-close menu) (void))
   (define/override (edit-menu:between-find-and-preferences menu) (void))
 
 The solution was to add a bunch of these:
 
       (define/override (file-menu:create-open?)        #f)
       (define/override (file-menu:create-open-recent?) #f)
       (define/override (file-menu:create-new?)         #f)
       (define/override (file-menu:create-save?)        #f)
       (define/override (file-menu:create-revert?)      #f)
 
 And I also re-hacked `reorder-menus' to check if a menu is left
 without entries -- and remove it if this is the case.  That got rid of
 the empty Help menu.

 That is arguably right for the standalone Help Desk, but wrong for
 DrScheme. There, you also want to mixin the drsheme:frame:basics-mixin,
 I believe.
 
 I'm not sure about that for Help Desk, tho. At a minimum, you should
 include a Help menu that does the same thing as the standalone Help
 menu does (rather than hacking reorder-menus).

 There is something in which I missed it in the code -- but I'm not
 sure that it's what you're talking about:
 
   ;; this one should be defined by help desk.
   (define frame-mixin
     (namespace-variable-value 'help-desk:frame-mixin #f (lambda () (lambda (x) x))))
 
   ...
 
   (define bug-frame%
     (class (frame-mixin (frame:standard-menus-mixin frame:basic%))
       (init title)
       ...))
 
 I didn't touch that part at all.

 Well, the reorder-menus hack is fine -- it only removes menus that are
 completely empty.  So if there is some item included in the help menu
 it will not disappear.
 
 The thing is that under both Help-Desk and DrScheme, the help menu was
 empty.  I did try to add
 
   (define/override (help-menu:create-about?) #t)
 
 the menu had that entry, but when it was selected nothing happens.

 No, not talking about that, I don't think.

 There is no reason to make the menu re-ordering function remove menus.
 You can do that separately if necessary. Lets leave that function
 alone, ok?

 Yes ... I think you need to actually override the callback and do
 something good.
 
 It's fine; I'll look into it when I get a chance.

 Why do it separately?  The only thing that might make it an undesired
 feature is if applications can add menu-items later on.  Otherwise,
 you want to remove them at the same stage that re-ordering is done,
 which doesn't really make a difference if it's in reorder-menus or in
 a different place that runs at the same time.  If you don't remove
 them, and applications don't add more menu-items later, then you end
 up with a bogus menu that has an ugly empty box underneath it (X) or a
 menu that grabs the keyboard focus without any visible effects
 (Windows).
 
 If you don't want reorder-menus to remove empty directories and apps
 don't add menu entries later, then the only reasonable behavior I can
 think of is to throw an exception.

 Well, I actually can't think of a useful help item for that dialog...

 Please leave the function alone. It has had that behavior for something
 like 10 years and there is no need to change it. Go make another
 function.
