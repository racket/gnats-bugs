>Description:
I receive the following error when simply trying to make use of the Racket sandbox:

file-exists?: `exists' access denied for /usr/lib/libcrypto.so

This error is thrown for all evaluations, even simple code.

I was told that this type of error should not have been thrown and that it is likely a bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following is the simple sandbox I am using: https://raw.github.com/gf3/protobot/master/sandboxed-ipc-repl.rkt

I have used it with success on different servers and with the same racket version, unfortunately it seems to fail on a new server for an unknown reason.

 From discussion with Gianni on IRC before I asked him to submit this
 bug, I think what's going on here is as follows:
 
 1. The program runs fine on one machine.
 2. The source is copied to another machine, without some compiled files.
 3. The runtime tries to decide if new compiled zos are required, using
 sha1 hashes
 4. This involves opening libcrypto, leading to this error.
 
 I think lower levels of Racket should be able to do this test using
 libcrypto without falling afoul of the sandbox check.

 The code for loading possibly compiled code is done with the original
 permissions (search the file for `current-load/use-compiled').  In any
 case, I can't reproduce this problem with the given code.

 Is there any difference in how planet packages are handled here?
 Might that have been the problem?

 I have tried it without the Planet package, there is no difference.

 Gianni: I still can't reproduce this with that code (and without the
 planet package there).

 Eli, I was informed that the Racket version on the server that it failed was from the pacman package manager. I'm not sure if that's relevant or helpful.

 I don't have any experience with archlinux, and no idea if there's
 anything they do that can lead to such a failure.  I can try to debug
 it if I can log into the machine.
