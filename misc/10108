>Description:
This program:

#lang scheme

(define f (flat-named-contract "foo" number?))

(define/contract (g x y)
  (-> f "baz" f)
  12)

(g 'bar 12)

prints this contract error message:

'page broke the contract (-> "foo" "baz" "foo") on g; expected <foo>, given: bar

The contract printed uses "" around the name of the "foo" flat named contract, which is not as nice as I'd like for error messages.  More seriously, it's not possible to distinguish between contracts for single strings, and contracts with names, since they print identically.

`flat-named-contract' also seems to accept symbols for the name, and that works better for my purpose here, but this is not mentioned in the documentation.

 IIRC this is a docs bug; you have to use a symbol,so that names like
 (or/c #f #t) can be supported (if desired).

 That's fine, symbols work great.  But how is (or/c #f #t) a symbol?

 Now I'm totally confused.  Are names allowed to be arbitrary
 s-expressions?  If so, shouldn't `flat-named-contract' accept them?
 If not, how can (or/c #f #t) be a name?

 It does accept them. This is what I meant about a 'docs bug'.
