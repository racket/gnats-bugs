Hi
I think I may be doing something odd, but I'm not sure what it is.
I tried downloading and installing v299.33 binary for windows
it:
    - Installs without any errors
    - Opens and interprets with no errors in the htDP and other non experimental languages
    - Seems to freeze when I try to select FrTime as the language and run a section of code.

Any ideas welcome :)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrScheme
2. Select "Choose Language" from the "Language" menu
3. Select either of the FrTime languages
4. Click the "run" button, with or without code in the definitions window

Reason>>> frtime -- this might not be a bug in the frtime code, but
you're in the best position to identify the source of the
problem and if it's due to something else then move the bug
on to the right person.

 I believe this is due to a problem in dns-find-nameserver on Windows.  I'm
 not sure what to do about it.

 Can you minimize it to a short code snippet that demonstrates the
 problem?
 
 (BTW, I just noticed the garbled email address and changed it.)

 Sure.  As I recall, simply run DrScheme under Windows, load
 (lib "dns.ss" "net"), and call (dns-find-nameserver).  I think the
 exception arises in "process" or "subprocess".

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by gcooper at Wed, 13 Apr 2005 11:22:02 -0400
Reason>>> dns-find-nameserver seems to crash in windows; i think this is the source of 
the problem


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by gcooper at Tue, 12 Dec 2006 01:40:38 -0500
Reason>>> fixed a while ago
