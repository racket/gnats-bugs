Some of the links in the documentation do not point to the
right document.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Help Desk, proceed along the following sequence of links:

- search for "draw-lib" [w/out quotes] in the finder
- this produces one link; click on it (in "Directories teaching library")

This produces a list of procedure contracts followed by
"Larger interfaces are defined by" followed by three links.
The first two of these links points to a very wrong document.

        Some of the links in the documentation do not point to the
        right document.
 
 Apparently, the script that generates these pages was run at the
 wrong time.  I've asked Matthew to clarify when the script needs 
 to be run.  I'll re-run it, once that's clear.

 Matthias,
 
 	Shriram's bug report (PR 1056) said:
 
 	In Help Desk, proceed along the following sequence of links:
 
 	- search for "draw-lib" [w/out quotes] in the finder
 	- this produces one link; click on it (in "Directories teaching library")
 
 	This produces a list of procedure contracts followed by
 	"Larger interfaces are defined by" followed by three links.
 	The first two of these links points to a very wrong document.
 
 Apparently, it's the links in the source that are incorrect.
 According to the file responsibilities list, you're the 
 maintainer of these files.  Can you please correct these links, and 
 run the mkdocs script?
 
 You should run the script as ~scheme, so the files have uniform 
 ownership.

 I don't have the scheme password. I ran mkdocs last night, for a different
 reason, and at least it runs.
