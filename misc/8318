>Description:
Feature request:

The handin server should contain, preferably as a subcollection, a set of modules that safely replace teachpacks such as "world.ss" that create windows or ask for user intervention.
>How-To-Repeat:
Anecdote: 
Run the handin server (as mred, so students can 
submit WXME files) on a box with twm as the window manager. Submit a file containing a call to big-bang, which opens a window for the animation. The server will block, failing to accept any new connections, until you place the window in twm.

 Here it is:
 
 (module world mzscheme
   (provide big-bang on-mouse-event)
   (define big-bang void)
   (define on-mouse-event void)
   (define ... void))

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 23 Jan 2007 15:22:51 -0500
Reason>>> handin

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 23 Jan 2007 15:22:51 -0500
Reason>>> I made the default configuration use a local
"overridden-collects" directory as the first item in the
collection library search path list.  For example, putting
a "mzlib/string.ss" file in there will make evaluation use
that instead of the real one.  Can you please add the bogus
world teachpack in?
