>Description:
The following Scribble forms (using scribble/eval) should behave the same, but they don't:
  @(interaction X)
  @(interaction (eval:alts X X))

'do-eval' in scribble/eval uses 'syntax-case' to destructure its input, which starts out as an S-expression. When it recurs on the subform of the 'eval:alts' form, it converts it from an S-expression to a syntax object, attaching a bad lexical context.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the scribble utility on the following file:

#lang scribble/doc
@(require scribble/manual)
@(require scribble/eval)
@(define the-eval (make-base-eval))
@(interaction #:eval the-eval (require (lib "class.ss")))
These should be the same, but they aren't:
@(interaction #:eval the-eval object%)
@(interaction #:eval the-eval (eval:alts object% object%))
