>Description:
A popular Web browser on GNU/Linux platforms is KDE Konqueror.

If you'd like to add support Konqueror to sendurl.ss, the
below code seems to be the easiest way.  It seems to create
a new "konqueror" process for each request.

Just FYI, an alternative, harder way, which seems to reuse existing
processes, is to execute a command like the following:

   dcop konqueror-2383 default "createNewWindow(QString)" "http://www.yahoo.com/"

Where "konqueror-2383" is an example of referring to a particular process
(PID 2383).  Determining the 0 or more running Konqueror processes requires
running the "dcop" command without any arguments, which emits to stdout a
list of available KDE processes, one per line.  This output has to be parsed
to pick out the 0 or more "konquer(-[0-9]+)?" lines and select one of them.
In the case no such lines occur, send-url would have fallback to the kfmclient
easy way.

The code below is for the easy way.

 I can commit your code in as is, but a new process doesn't seem too
 polite...  Isn't there any *sane* way of reusing an existing process?
 (Sane meaning that it is simple enough for me to maintain even when
 I'm not using KDE.)

 Sorry, not that I know of.
 
 I've actually stopped using Konqueror in the time since I submitted that
 enhancement suggestion,
 
 Perhaps a good solution could wait until a user of both PLT and KDE
 wants to tackle it.

Reason>>> Closing.  I agree that it's best to wait until a KDE user
complains so they can test solutions.
