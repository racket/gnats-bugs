Is something wrong with my pointing out here? Please check it up and give me a reply. Thanks in advance.

 Your interpretation of PLT Scheme syntax is mistaken.  The period
 character is a legal part of an identifier, so '(a.null) is a list
 containing the single symbol whose name is "a.null".  If you want a
 dotted pair, try '(a . null) -- but that still won't give you quite
 what you want.  The value 'null is just a symbol in PLT Scheme.
 Unquoted, it's a variable name that happens to contain the empty list
 value, but that value is not the same as 'null.  If you want the
 singleton list containing the element 'a, i.e. 'a consed onto the
 empty list, you can write it any of the following ways:
 
 '(a . ())
 '(a)
 (cons 'a null)
 (list 'a)
 
 I hope that clears up your problem.  Good luck!
