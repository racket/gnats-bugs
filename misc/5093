>Description:
1) default priority should be `medium'
2) the two macos choices should be:

   Macintosh Powerpc (MacOS Classic)
   Macintosh Powerpc (MacOS X)

3) the capitolization of severity, priority, and class is not consistent and doesn't match the standard. All should be lowercase, I think. The important test is what query-pr does. We should make sure the searching for all "software bug"s finds things properly. That's why the names were all lowercased before and that's why Help Desk's submission uses lowercase.

 Also, if it is possible, the reproducible and description fields 
 should be in a mono-spaced font (during entry, on the web page).
 
 Thanks,

 What you see in the dropdown lists isn't what's sent to the CGI
 script.  That's just the pretty-printed version.  The NAME attribute 
 in the menu option is what's sent -- those are all lowercased.

 They show up that way for me with IE.

 Why "Powerpc" and not "PowerPC"?

 No, the corresponding class is "sw-bug", which is what the form sends.

 I was using IE on the mac and didn't get mono-spaced fonts.
 
 I guess that the only problem with the drop downs is that the
 capitolization just isn't consistent, then.
 
 PowerPC is probably better, yes.

 Fixed.
 
 But you'd better learn to spell "capitalization"
 correctly if you want to pass your defense. :-)

 I always get confused which one is the building and which one is
 everything else. English is so broken :)
