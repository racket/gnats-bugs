>Description:
The XML library's error reporting is not good enough. Try to
use mzscheme's primitives's style of error reporting, when possible.
I give an example below.
>How-To-Repeat:
  > (require-library "xml.ss" "xml")
  > (xexpr->xml '(a () ()))
  xexpr->xml: malformed xexpr ()

Here the context of the xexpr is missing. The entire xexpr should
be in the error message (well, use the ~e formatter, which will
truncate it at the right place if it is too big)
