>Description:
When I enter the following erroneous Scheme code (straight from R5RS section 5), I get a rather bizarre error.

The code:

(let-syntax
    ((foo (syntax-rules ()
            ((foo (proc args ...) body ...)
             (define proc
               (lambda (args ...)
                 body ...))))))
    (let ((x 3))
      (foo (plus x y) (+ x y))
      (define foo x)
      (plus foo x)))

The error:

define-values: illegal use (not at top-level) in: (define-values (proc) (lambda (args ...) body ...))

This occurred when using the R5RS language level.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the code specified into DrScheme's definitions window and hit execute.

 The strange error message was indeed a bug in 200alpha1. Version
 200alpha12 doesn't report an error, even though R5RS says it "is an
 error".
 
 Whenever R5RS says "reports an error", DrScheme does. In many "is an
 error" cases in R5RS, though, it's not an error in DrScheme due to some
 extension in the underlying MzScheme language.
 
 Technically, this is not a case of non-compliance, due to the
 difference between "reports an error" and "is an error" in the spec.
 (It would be nice if the "R5RS" langauge in DrScheme reported an error
 for every "is an error", but that's not practical.)
 
 In this particular case, MzScheme extends R5RS by more precisely
 defining how internal definitions are expanded. Here's the relevant
 documentation (see the end of section 2.8.5):
