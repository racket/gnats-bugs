compile: unbound identifier (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) in: #%top-interaction error when using neil/sicp with DrRacket.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make sure '#lang planet neil/sicp' is present in your automatic language line. If not, add it and restart DrRacket.
2. Write anything at the input prompt. It should fail with 'compile: unbound identifier (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) in: #%top-interaction'
3. Click on the 'Run' button at the top.
4. Rewrite the same expression as before. We no longer get the same issue and we will get the expected response to the written expresion.

 As Robby replied to the earlier bogus email address -- this is a bug
 in a planet package -- it should be reported here:
 
   http://planet.racket-lang.org/trac/newticket
 
 Be sure to choose the "component" field that matches neil/sicp.
 
 In any case, I'm CCing Neil, the author of that package.

 You may stop bothering with this; the guy has no desire at all to help
 me solve this issue. Neil van Dyke hasn't responded to a single email of
 mine.
 
 Cheers and thanks anyway.
