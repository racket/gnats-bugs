>Description:
DrScheme's Run, and Stepper buttons both make new windows (assuming there is a GUI there) but clicking the button twice either makes old windows go away or brings back the old window from last time.

The macro stepper, on the other hand, keeps all the old windows around and just creates new ones each time a button is clicked.

It would be nice if a second click on the macro stepper button would either kill the old stuff (like Run does) or bring back the old stuff (like the Stepper does) but in the second case, there should probably also be a warning (like the Stepper does) saying "the program is different!"

 Oh, I don't do that (it makes me think of all those old bad
 REPL-as-program-construction problems, but I agree it isn't AS bad as
 the REPL), but I guess it can be useful.
 
 Maybe it would feel less confusing if the little warning messages that
 come up were attached to the appropriate window.

 I've added code that adds a warning line to the top of a macro stepper
 window that "outlives" its execution.
 
 Due to a separate request from Jay, I've also added the filename being
 macro-stepped to the frame label.

 I'll see if I can fix that, too...

 That works fine for run!

 Personally, I *strongly* prefer the current behavior of the macro
 stepper, which I use all the time.  I don't know if it's the right
 behavior for the stepper or the run button, but I use the ability to
 see two different expansions at once quite regularly.

 What problems are you worried about, in particular?  The program runs
 to completion before the macro stepper opens (to a first
 approximation).  So I don't see how state at the repl can cause
 problems.
 
 Also, when you have different programs in different tabs, it's very
 useful to be able to macro-step them both.  This doesn't work at least
 with the stepper, I didn't try gui programs and run.

 I definitely support that.

 What do you think about making that message black on a yellow
 background, like the stepper? It shouldn't be hard to do (if you need
 code, I can supply it)

 Sure, I'll do that.
