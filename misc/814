>Description:
I am about to teach the picture language example in the Abelson
and Sussman book and I would like for my students to be able to
print the pictures they generate, to hand in with their code.
As far as I can tell from browsing the DrScheme documentation,
there is no built-in way to print a graphics window to a file
(say, a ps file) so that it can be printed out.  Is there a
way to do this?

My window manager lists "PRINT" on one of its menus attached
to each window on my console, but that command doesn't work
on my machines either.

I wrote a program to write a graphics window to a TIFF file,
but that will be the subject of my next bug report.

 Unfortunately, there is no direct way to print a graphics window. You can, 
 however, use screen capture. 
 
 Under Windows type "alt-printscreen" or "control-printscreen". These will 
 save either the entire screen or the current window (I forget which is 
 which) to the clip board. Then, go to your favorite paint program, paste 
 and print. 
 
 On the macintosh, type command-shift-3. This will save a file to your 
 harddrive named "Picture 1". Open it with simple text and print it. 
 
 Under X Windows, use the program "xv". It has a screen capture option. I 
 believe it is called "grab". To get there, start up "xv" and click with 
 button 3 on the initial window. You should get a new window with a grab 
 button along the bottom.
 
 Hope that helps,
 Robby
