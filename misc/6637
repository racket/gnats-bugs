Hi all,

I've written programs using the trig/trancendental functions for drawing points using viewport graphics and turtle graphics programs as well.  In both cases I have not been able to get consistent results drawing angled lines.  

As the following small turtle program illustratates, a periodic error in drawing 45 deg lines appears when iteratively "turning the turtle).  The program does not consistently produce crsip 45 deg angles.  Is this a math setting that I need to alter?

If not, what is the problem with how I am using the graphics or the math functions.

Many thanks,
John Conti

(require (lib "turtles.ss" "graphics"))
(turtles)

(define (squig)
  (turn 45)
  (draw 10)
  (turn -90)
  (draw 10)
  (turn 45))

(define (squign n)
  (if (< 0 n)
      (begin
        (squig)
        (squign (- n 1)))))

(begin
  (turn 180)
  (move 200)
  (turn 180)
  (squign 40))

 Dont' know if this windows-specific or not, but the angles look pretty
 good to me under macos x. Well, there are 5 in a row with an extra
 pixel and then 6 or 7 without and then another with etc etc. More
 importantly, the line is straight.
 
 This does not appear to be a turtles library issue, tho. Do you agree?

 There's no significant loss of precision in the turtle's state. The
 problem is in drawing the turtle's path on the screen.
 
 You've asked the turtle to move 10 steps at 45-degree angle. For each
 step, then, the turtle moves 7.071 pixels to the right. For a few
 steps, drawing turtle line must drop the fractional part of the
 location, but eventually the fractions add up, so that the drawing
 needs a "leap pixel" to better approximate the turtle's mathematical
 location. (There's approximation in the Y direction, too, so the
 complete story on lines is a little more complex, but that's the idea.)
 
 If you change the 10s in your program to (* 10 (sqrt 2)), then the
 turtle's mathematical position maps neatly to pixels.
 
 Matthew

 I just replied to the PR, but I forgot to CC you.
 
 On a related note, I'm disappointed that Mac OS X, Windows, and X11 all
 approximate the requested line in different ways. As far as I can tell,
 though, there's nothing I can do about it without having MrEd draw each
 pixel itself.
