>Description:
filled-rounded-rectangle appropriately rounds off its corners, but the non-filled version seems to be equivalent to just a regular rectangle.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try the following program:

#lang slideshow

(filled-rounded-rectangle 100 100 -0.1)
(rounded-rectangle 100 100 -0.1)
(filled-rounded-rectangle 100 100 -0.5)
(rounded-rectangle 100 100 -0.5)

 After looking at the code for these two functions, it looks like the  
 interpretation of the sign of the fourth argument is the opposite in  
 rounded-rectangle than in filled-rounded-rectangle.  I assume that's  
 just a case where one got updated and the other didn't at some point.
 
 For example:
 
 #lang slideshow
 
 (filled-rounded-rectangle 100 100 -0.1)
 (rounded-rectangle 100 100 0.1)
 (filled-rounded-rectangle 100 100 -0.5)
 (rounded-rectangle 100 100 0.5)
 
 shows the similar rectangles I would have expected from the first  
 program.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by ryanc at Fri, 06 May 2011 02:21:40 -0400
Reason>>> seems to be fixed
