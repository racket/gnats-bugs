>Description:
When using the test-harness included w/ the EOPL "language", 
EOPL:ERROR-STOP is set so that the test harness reports the error
but doesn't stop evaluation.  However, evaluation is halted, as if
no change had been made to EOPL:ERROR-STOP.
>How-To-Repeat:
* Pick the EOPL language
* load plt/collects/interps/3-5.smc
* load test-harness.scm & test-suite.smc from the same directory
* then eval (run-all).

In particular, test test3-1-unbound-variable should report a pass,
but instead interrupts the evaluation w/ an error.
