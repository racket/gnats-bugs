>Environment:
	dr, 50s1, nt
>Description:
	use sixlibs functions to create canvas and draw things
	wrong window size -- annoying for game playing
>How-To-Repeat:
	fancy: 
	download TeachScheme's six Libs files:
	  draw-sig.ss, ..., pingp-play-lib.ss
	install pingp-play-lib.ss as library in drscheme
	execute
	(go 'Matthew)
	and watch
	less fancy: open your own window and draw strings to see for yourself
>Fix:
	a quick fix is to tell people to maximize their window
	(but that's too large)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 29 08:07:58 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This is fixed for version 51. Sixlib now uses the mred: container
classes to get the window size right. This takes care of the
persistent sizing problems once and for all.
