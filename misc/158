MrSpidey doesn't start up.  I get this error in the xterm:

  compound-unit/sig: 1st linkage (MRED signature) for GUI contains 
  an extra value name "make-info-frame%" which is not required by 
  GUI unit's 1st import (mred signature)

Needless to say, I'm very disappointed.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
Start drscheme.
Enter trivial expression.
Save to file.
Start Spidey.

 Cormac, when you get back, you need to remake your .zo's.
