>Description:
Theres not enough example in the help desk. I'm looking since about 2 hours to know how to make a menu, and when its time to make a menu-item, i got a "procedure of arity" error. Then I try to search for procedure of arity, but i Cant find anything on it. I just wanna tell you that this software sucks and need more examples and support for developpers or it will be lost through the years, cause so unfunny to program.
