Hello, 

given the following code


(define (until-diff L sum last)
  (cond
    ((null? (cdr L)) (if-last L))
    ((equal? (car L) last) (until-diff (cdr L) (+ 1 sum) (car L)))
    (else (cons sum (list last)))))

(define (until-else L last)
  (cond
    ((null? (cdr L)) (list last))
    ((equal? (car L) last) until-else (cdr L) (car L))
    (else L)))

(define (scounter L)
  (if (equal? (car L) 1) 
      (cdr L)
      l))


When I call (until-else '(1 1 1 1 0 0) 1)
I get 1, when I think I should get (0 0).


Second, I have to constantly require-library to restore the functions needed to perform little functions (caddr, find-if, etc). Every time I close Dr. Scheme I have to require-library for all of the functions again. Before I didn't.

I have assignments due next week, so if you could tell me what to do, whether it is a software or hardware problem, I would appreciate it.  I have run diskscan and found no errors on my harddrive. 

Thanks 
Duncan Morhardt

 Dear Duncan,
 
 thanks for your bug report.
 
 You have two principal issues, and  I will address them in order.
 
 First, your code does not execute.  The first thing I did to debug 
 your code for you was to copy it into DrScheme, set the language 
 level to "Beginning Student", and click "Execute." Lo and behold, I 
 got an error message:
 
 "Clause is not in question-answer format"
 
 The error highlighted the following line:
 
 ((equal? (car L) last) until-else (cdr L) (car L))
 
 If you examine this line, it seems that you've forgotten a pair of 
 parentheses around the "until-else (cdr L) (car L)" part of the cond 
 clause.  Beginning Student level is especially convenient for 
 catching this kind of bug.
 
 In the future, you may find it helpful to try to narrow down your 
 problem to a relatively short statement before submitting a bug 
 report.  It makes it easier to find and correct bugs in DrScheme, and 
 occasionally, what you think is a bug may not turn out to be one at 
 all.
 
 
 Regarding the second part of your problem: functions like car and 
 caddr are always available in DrScheme.  If you find that these 
 functions are not bound, please submit a concise series of steps that 
 show that (for you) they are not.  Find-if, on the other hand, is not 
 a procedure that I'm familiar with; you don't mention just which 
 library it is that you need to require, and I'm guessing it may be a 
 Berkeley-specific one.
 
 It's true that in order to use functions defined in a library, you'll 
 need to require that library at the beginning of each evaluation.  I 
 believe DrScheme has always worked in this way.  If you place this 
 require-library call at the top of your file, and save your work at 
 the end of each session with DrScheme, you shouldn't need to type it 
 more than once.
