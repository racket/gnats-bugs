>Description:
Detection of ELF-based linux systems is dependent on running the command
`file /bin/ls`.  That command, however, requires that /bin/ls be world
readable, which is not always the case (the default configuration for the
system I was installing on was for most of the binaries to be mode 511).  
As a result, archsys decided to look in plt/.bin/i386-linux-aout/ instead of
plt/.bin/i386-linux/

Workarounds:
1.  Make /bin/ls mode 555 (requires root permissions)
2.  Fiddle around in archsys (kinda rude, I think)
3.  Create the i386-linux-aout directory as a symlink (eh, decent)
>How-To-Repeat:
Run anything that calls archsys on an ELF linux platform with /bin/ls not
world readable.

 For our next release, `archsys' performs the following check for Linux:
 
       if [ -r /lib/libdl.so.1 ]; then
         SYS=i386${SEP}linux
       elif [ `file /bin/ls | grep ELF | wc -l` = 1 ]; then
         SYS=i386${SEP}linux
       else
         SYS=i386${SEP}linux${SEP}aout
       fi
 
 This fixes a problem encountered by another user. Would the above check
 work on your system (i.e., does /lib/libdl.so.1 exist as
 world-readable)?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I believe it would.  I haven't tested it (I suppose I can if you wish), but
 that library is world-readable.  (That's a much more reasonable
 assumption--if libraries aren't world-readable, no one except root can
 compile.)
 
 In addition, it would be nice to mention this detection scheme on the
 unix-install webpage so that just in case somebody has a system odd enough
 to end up with a similar bug in the future.
