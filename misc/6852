>Description:
Everything is built in OS X 10.3, which has a later version of libssl than 10.2. The openssl collection is built to link with this later version, so in 10.2 it fails to load the library:

load-extension: couldn't open "/Applications/PLT Scheme v206.1/collects/openssl/compiled/native/ppc-macosx/mzssl.so" (dlcompat: dyld: /Applications/PLT Scheme v206.1/DrScheme.app/Contents/MacOS/DrScheme can't open library: /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.7.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)
)

>How-To-Repeat:
1. Download/install latest nightly build on OS X 10.2 box.
2. Run DrScheme.

 I don't think a nightly 10.2 build matters, but perhaps we should
 consider this for the release?

 What needs to be done to fix this?  I would prefer not to add any
 one-time hacks to the build script...

 I'm not expert on this matters, but I would guess that a 10.2 build
 would solve the problem.
 
 Now that I think about it, do we distribute the offending library in
 our regular releases?

 AFAICT, there are no 10.2 machines around here...

 Yes.
