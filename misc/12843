>Description:
There are several nonsensical errors on pages:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Literal_Sets_and_Conventions.html
http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Experimental.html

The errors look like:
current-directory: `exists' access denied for /var/tmp/racket/src/build/

You may want to search the documentation for other such errors.  I have a feeling they appear on pages other than the ones I found.

 These have been fixed for the next release.  In the meantime, you can
 see the pre-release documentation here:
