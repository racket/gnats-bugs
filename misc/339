>Description:
When I try to execute DrScheme in a Win-OS/2 session (compatable
with Windows 3.11) an error message appears stating "Dos error: 23".
The installation after being completed said it was succesfully installed, 
but when exiting the Win-OS/2 session a message appeared on the screen indicating
that the following files had to be updated manually;
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\lib\old1.main.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\old2.min.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\old1.min.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\min\old2.min-dfa.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\min\old1.min.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\min\old1.min-live.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\min\old1.min-dfa.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\min\old1.min-dfa-AV.ss
   c:\plt\mrspidey\sba\min\old.min2.ss
If you can provide any suggestions on what to do or how to update the files 
manually, it would be greatly appreciated. My system is a Pentium-75 MHz with
24 MByte of Ram. Thank you.

 None of these files are actually used by DrScheme, so you can ignore
 them. (They really shouldn't be in the distribution.)
