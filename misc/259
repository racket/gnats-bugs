works in MrEd, but in DrScheme, it gives the following error:

 The problem is that graphicr.ss relies on macro.ss and compat.ss.  The
 dependency on compat.ss should be removed by using `class' instead of
 `make-class'. The dependency on macro.ss should be at least performed
 by graphicu.ss, and the dependency should be documented wherever the
 graphics collection is documented (I can't find it).
 
 In the long run, there would just be a MrEd mode in DrScheme where
 macro.ss and compat.ss are already loaded, so these problems go
 away. :) For now, I'd modify the library files myself, but Robby has
 them checked out.

 Will fix. There is no documentation for that --Matthew, if you could
 provide a skeleton documentation for those libraries I will be glad to fill
 it in when I get back. If not, that's okay I suppose -- I'd just like to be
 in sync with mzlib.
