>Description:
In order to create a MzScheme extension, I need to link in
some .o files and a static (.a) library.  The .o's need
to *precede* the .a in the command passed to ld:

    ld ... foo.o bar.o -L. -lbaz -o foo.so 

Otherwise, the references in the .o's don't get resolved.

mzc requires extra linker flags to precede the .o files:

    mzc -ld foo.so ++ldf -L. ++ldf -lbaz foo.o bar.o

which puts the files in the wrong order for ld.

As a workaround, I tried

    mzc -ld foo.so ++ldf foo.o ++ldf bar.o ++ldf -L. ++ldf -lbaz 

but mzc complains that it needs at least one file argument.

Perhaps another flag is needed for linker flags that follow the
indicated files.

 Include the post-file linker flags as regular arguments to mzc. In
 other words,
 
   mzc -ld foo.so foo.o bar.o  -L. -lbaz
 
 should work fine. No mzc flag can appear after a non-flag argument, so
 everything after foo.o is a non-flag to mzc. Non-flag arguments to mzc
 are passed through as arguments to ld.
 
 If, for some reason, you wanted to start with -L., use the -- flag to
 terminate the list of mzc flags. :
 
  mzc -ld foo.so -- -L. foo.o bar.o -lbaz

 Ah, OK.  This wasn't clear from 
 
 	mzc --help
 
 Thanks for the tip.
