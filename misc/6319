>Description:
After downloading plt.src.x.tar and unpacking into ~bill/downloads/, then
  cd plt/src :

-- ./configure --enable-dynlib
    Succeeded (no error msgs)

-- make
   succeeded (no error msgs)

-- make install
   succeeded, and placed the executables in ~bill/downloads/plt/bin

I was able to run the tests successfully.

Later I decided to re-install in /usr/local/plt.  According to plt/src/README, Compiling for Unix variants, step #3, I did

-- ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/plt --enable-dynlib
   Succeeded

-- su root

-- make install

FAILURE #1:

cd ..; /home/bill/downloads/plt/src/libtool cp mzscheme/libmzgc.la
   /usr/local/plt/lib/libmzgc.la
libtool: install: `mzscheme/libmzgc.la' is not a valid libtool archive

Examination of src/mzscheme revealed libmzgc.a, NOT libmzgc.la, and
libmzscheme.a, NOT libmzscheme.la.  I hand edited src/mzscheme/Makefile to
use the .a forms and tried again.  Now make install got through mzscheme OK, but then came

FAILURE #2:

cd ..; /home/bill/downloads/plt/src/libtool cp mred/libmred.la
  /usr/local/plt/lib/
libtool: install: `mred/libmred.la' is not a valid libtool archive

Examination of src.mred reveals that there is no libmred there at all, neither libmred.la nor libmred.a

At this point, I have no idea how to proceed.

Briefly, compile and install in a local dir, then attempt to re-install in

 I'll look into this more, but I suspect that the last setence of #3 is
 wrong: i.e., after setting --prefix, you may need to `make clean'
 and then repeat step 2 (i.e., `make').
 
 Can you try a `make clean', then `make', then `make install'?
 
 I'll try this soon myself, but you may get to it before I do...
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
