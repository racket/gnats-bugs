>Description:
The file copying.lib should be renamed to
copying-lib.txt (or .html ?)
in order for windows to open it directly.

The change is in
collects\drscheme\private\app.ss line 601.
>How-To-Repeat:
Choose About in DrScheme's help menu.
Click on Copying.lib.
Windows doesn't know .lib-files and thus doesn't
display the file directly.

State-Changed-Why:
    I've just replaced the link with the pathname to the file so people can use whatever means they like for reading the file. Hopefully that is sufficient (even adding a .txt version didn't work for macos x...)
