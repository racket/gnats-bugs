>Description:
	If the reader is applied to a file containing
           a"b
        twice, it returns the symbol `a' then the symbol `b'.
        The second read should instead cause an error.

	Putting a space before the double-quote gives the
	right behavior. The problem is not restricted to
	double-quote; other delimiters, such as quote and
	open-paren, have the same problem
>How-To-Repeat:
	(define p (open-input-string "a\"b))
	(read/zodiac p)
	(read/zodiac p)

State-Changed-Why:

This was a misunderstand of what `read/zodiac' is. ((read/zodiac p
start)) is *not* meant to be analogous (read p). Specifically,
read/zodiac does not expect anyone else to ever use the port `p' after
is is dedicated to the zodiac reader. Thus, it is free to consume an
extra character of lookahead. So (begin ((read/zodiac p start))
((read/zodiac p start))) can give a different result than (begin (read
p) (read p)).

For now, there does not appear to be a reason to make read/zodiac more
like read.
