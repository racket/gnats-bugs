>Description:
I wasn't able to compile the "Hello World" example from the
Inside MZScheme overview.

From the Inside MZScheme manual:

"Assuming that this code is in the file hw.c, the extension is compiled 
under Unix with the following two commands: 

  mzc --cc hw.c
  mzc --ld hw.so hw.o"

My output for the first line above was:

mzc:  only one instance of one flag from (-e -extension -c ...
[some omitted] .. -cc -ld) is allowed.

I'm puzzled, as the only flag I typed was -cc.

thanks,

 There is a difference between -cc (one hyphen) and --cc (two hyphens).
 Try using --cc.

 -cc is shorthand for -c -c. You meant --cc (two dashes).
 
 Yes, it's confusing.
 
 In general, -xyz is short for -x -y -z. Flags with names that have
 more than one letter (such as --cc or --compile-extension) are always
 preceeded with two dashes.
