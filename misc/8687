>Description:
(under windows vista)
I tried from the manual(plot)
(require (lib "plot.ss" "plot")) 
 (define 3dfun (lambda (x y) (* (sin x) (sin y))))
(plot (contour 3dfun))
It is crashing DrScheme.
I am using the 370 version.
It could be a "big" in the manual. I tried 
(plot3d (contour 3dfun)) like the kind of plotting you have in Gnuplot but there is no plot3D.
I had the same problem with the 360 release.
best regards.
Jerome HUCK.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "plot.ss" "plot")) 
(define 3dfun (lambda (x y) (* (sin x) (sin y))))
(plot (contour 3dfun))
