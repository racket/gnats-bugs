 I don't see any problem with running this code -- tried on my machine
 (Fedora 7, and on Solaris).  But I wouldn't be surprised if it does
 run into problems, and in a way that cannot be fixed: what your code
 is doing is it makes mzscheme try to use the input port from two
 threads at the same time.  I think that the behavior is unspecified
 even for two plain reads.  But in the readline, the interface is very
 simplistic, so there is no way to interrupt a waiting readline prompt.
 
 The bottom line is that readline is intended for unthreaded REPL use,
 or for single threaded input in your code if you want to.

 You fire up two threads, then wait for either one -- the second one
 crashes and gets back to the repl -- the repl now tries to read from
 stdin, but the readline thread is still alive.  So now you have two
 places that try to read from stdin, and mzscheme is completely unaware
 because the sharing is at the system level.

 No.  You must arrange for sequential access to stdin.
