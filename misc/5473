>Organization:
plt
>Environment:
unknown-platform
>Description:
> In the language selection dialog, the down arrow only works for
> languages under a single tab.  I cannot get from Advanced Student to
> Essentials of Programming Languages, for instance.
> 
> Worse, down arrow skips over tabs entirely.  So at Essentials of
> Programming Languages, down arrow goes to module, skipping over PLT.
> Instead, I would have preferred either that selecting PLT open the tab
> automatically, or better still wait till I hit return to open it.
> 
> I'm not sure if this is a bug (the second part definitely seems to
> be), and it's definitely an unwieldy feature because it forces me to
> use my mouse.
