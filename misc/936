When a text%'s on-insert method returns #f, the insert is still

>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define t (make-object (class text% ()
			 (override
			  [on-insert
			   (lambda (start len)
			     #f)])
			 (sequence
			   (super-init)))))
(define c (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send f show #t)
