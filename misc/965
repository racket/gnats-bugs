MS Windows 95
>Description:
If i compile the basic extension as documented in inside mz, in windows 95. DrScheme returns a bad version number 52 when (load-extension pathname) is called. Mzc version used is 53. The compiler used is MS C compiler that comes with Visual C++ 6.0

It is impossible to make a working extension because of this bug. 
>How-To-Repeat:
make a c file with the code in the documentation (packages/doc/insidemz/node4.htm before the "Embedding MzScheme into a Program" section). 

mzc --cc file.c
mzc --ld test.dll file.obj

and then loading it in DrScheme 

(load-extension "test.dll")

 The problem is that we bundled version 53 with a couple of bad files.
 
 The bad files are "mzdyn.exp" and "mzdyn.obj" in
  plt/collects/mzscheme/lib/win32/i386/msvc/
 
 You can download the correct version of those two files from
   ftp.cs.rice.edu/public/mflatt/
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience,
 Matthew
