>Description:
Once upon a time, dialog creation was very slow. So
MrEd was changed to make the find-file dialog just once,
hiding it when the dialog is closed, and then re-showing
the dialog when it is "opened" again.

Unfortunately, the dialog is re-used even if the arguments
to get-file are different. Thus, calling get-file with
the prompt "A", and get-file with the prompt "B" uses the
prompt "A" is both cases.

This is especially bad w.r.t to the new `parent' parameter!

>How-To-Repeat:
If the previous PR is not yet fixed, start DrScheme
and choose "Set Library To...", which gives a wacky
prompt, close that dialog, and select "Open..." The
wacky prompt is preserved.

Otherwise, run MrEd and call mred:get-file with two 
different prompts. Both dialogs will use the same prompt.
