>Description:
The DrScheme language documentation doesn't make it clear that
  '"hello"
and
 '5
are disallowed in the first three language levels.

At least, not clear enough for me to find it. I'm looking at the
table of languages, and it seems that the "quote'd list" row really 
applies to anything that isn't a symbol, not just lists.
