 I just refreshed all my manuals and things work fine. Probably you just
 need to do that. If so, do you mind closing the PR?

 I tried this from a 204 installation on a win 2000 box. I'll try later 
 and I'll close.

 Oh, that's bad news.
 
 In v204, it shouldn't be possible to get such things. Probably a real 
 error. Sigh.

 I wasn't clear in my last message -- since you're having the problem in
 v204, it means that there was a problem with the release in v204. One
 likely possibility is that the release docs weren't built properly.
 
 This is formerly a steck job, not an eli job....
