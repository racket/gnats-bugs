 It looks like your installation is broken. That file should be there.
 Perhaps you can say more about how you got PLT?

 Hucky,
 
 Sorry for the difficulty.  Your bug report indicates you are using PLT
 Scheme version 372; however, most of our tutorials are for the recent
 4.2.3 release (we added some decimal points to our version numbers, so
 4.2.3 is newer than 372).  If you upgrade your PLT Scheme
 installation, you will be able to run the tutorials.
 
 --Carl

 Sorry-- Carl gave the right answer. Version 372 is from 2007, tho, so
 you might want to consider doing something.
 
 You don't need to compile from source, we provide ubuntu-compatible
 versions on our web pages (if you have a recent version of ubuntu,
 that is).
 
 And compiling from source is not difficult. If you get stuck, you can
 ask questions on the plt-scheme mailing list.
 
 hth,
 Robby
