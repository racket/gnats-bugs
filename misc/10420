>Description:
(1) the grammar for "lexer" doesn't mention that
trigger/action-expr pairs have to be enclosed in parentheses
(which I found by trial and error).

(2) the grammar for "parser" says each grammar rule has a
"maybe-prec" and an "expr", and doesn't show the
"maybe-prec" being optional (although this is stated in the prose
two paragraphs later).
