>Description:
I'm using subprocess to run a process and after I'm done, I explicitly close the ports as instructed. Earlier, I was using read-bytes-line-evt on them, which is implemented using regexp-match-evt.

Since rme is implemented as a polling thread, it can error when I've closed the port and don't care about the rme event any longer. Here is some code that sometimes fails --- just run it many times and eventually you may get it.

There error displayed is:

1
regexp-match: input port is closed
regexp-match: input port is closed
> 

(Notice that the error is in a background thread.)

When run in MzScheme, you get the line information:

regexp-match: input port is closed

 === context ===
/Users/jay/Dev/svn/plt/collects/mzlib/port.ss:1025:4: try-again

I believe that the problem would be fixed if there were a test of if the port were closed before calling regexp-match-peek-positions.
