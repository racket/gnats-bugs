>Description:
When the version number of mzscheme changes, plot doesn't seem to be
re-compiled. I have to go in and delete the .so file manually to make
it come out right:

setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for Plot library (/Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects/plot)
setup-plt:   load-extension: bad version 206.1 (not 207.1) from "/Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects/plot/compiled/native/ppc-macosx/fit-low-level.so"
setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for HtDP Teachpacks (/Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects/htdp)
setup-plt:   load-extension: bad version 206.1 (not 207.1) from "/Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects/plot/compiled/native/ppc-macosx/fit-low-level.so"
Exit 1

If I go manually delete the .so files in plt/collects/plot and
re-run setup-plt, everything seems fine.
