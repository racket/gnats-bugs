I'm dowload all-docs.zip which contains MzScheme PS documentation, 
but I got a problem in printing, because all documentation formatted for 
"Letter" paper size and my printer supports just A4.
Can you provide PS documentation in A4 format?

Thank you, very much.
Vladimir

>How-To-Repeat:
1) Reformat "Letter" PS documentation to "A4"
2) Add A4 formatted documentation to the "Documentation index"

 Often you can get a PostScript file formatted for
 US letter size to print on A4 paper by editing the file directly.
 
 First, backup your original PostScript file, in case anything
 goes wrong.  Next, open the PostScript file in an 
 editor.  Look for occurrences of the word "letter" in the 
 header part of the PostScript file, and change them to
 "A4" (no quotes).  There should only be 1 or 2 such occurrences.
 Save the file, which should now be printable.
