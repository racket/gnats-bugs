(I can't seem to get the form from the Help Desk to go through, so I'm sending this via bugs.plt-scheme.)

When running programs with the profiler, particularly with SchemeUnit, the profiler seems to be finding points of the program that have not been set up in the profiler table, and it's raising an error: "hash-table-get: no value found for key: profile-pointXXX" (where XXX is some number).

I first ran across this bug running a long program at work with the profiler on, *not* using SchemeUnit. It crashed partway through the program with a similar error. But since I can't send you proprietary code from work (sorry about that), I can at least reproduce the problem (if it is the same problem) using SchemeUnit.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install SchemeUnit (http://schematics.sourceforge.net). Make a file with the following contents:

;; ------------------------------------------
(require (lib "test.ss" "schemeunit")
         (lib "text-ui.ss" "schemeunit"))

(define my-tests
  (make-test-suite
   "Tests for something.scm"

   (make-test-case
    "Test that succeeds"
    (assert = 2 2))
   
   (make-test-case
    "I fail.. heh-heh"
    (assert = 2 3))

   )
)

(test/text-ui my-tests)
;; ------------------------------------------

Turn on profiling in the current language. Then click the "Execute" button. I get an error saying "hash-table-get: no value found for key: profile-point501".

Details: I'm using v203 in Windows 2000 Professional. My language level is "Textual (MzScheme, includes R5RS" with the profiling turned on.

Let me know if this doesn't give you enough info and I'll see if I can help figure out how to reproduce it.

 Aha!
 
 PR 6146 reports similar behavior when MysterX COM event handlers
 are invoked when profiling is enabled.  I'd thought it was 
 particular to MysterX, but this PR suggests otherwise.

 Could that lapse also be responsible for PR 6146?
 
 Is the annotator always used when profiling is enabled?

 Yes. That's how it is implemented.

 Seems to be fixed, or at least I can't reproduce the bug anymore. Thanks,
