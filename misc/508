>Description:

It would be nice to have operations that accept a thread-descriptor and set 
the current-directory and current-parameterization for those
threads. Perhaps current-directory and current-parameterization can be
extended to accept a thread argument that defaults to the current-thread?

 This is the motivating example, from drs:
 
 	       (let ([directory
 		      (let/ec k
 			(unless (get-frame)
 			  (k first-dir))
 			(let*-values ([(filename) (send (ivar (get-frame) definitions-edit)
 							get-filename)]
 				      [(normalized) (if (string? filename)
 							(mzlib:file@:normalize-path filename)
 							(k first-dir))]
 				      [(base _1 _2) (split-path normalized)])
 			  (or base 
 			      first-dir)))])
 		 (run-in-evaluation-thread
 		  (lambda ()
 		    (current-directory directory))))
 
 
 it sets the directory, just before execute.

c-d is now a parameter; there doesn't appear to be enough
motivation to generalize current-parameterization.
