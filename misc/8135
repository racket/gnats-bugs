>Description:
Debugger output for both returned and moused-over value is obscured when the variable value lenght is too small for the display. This information should be available somehow otherwise it is impossible to debug code where the variables are large.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load up a long list, hit debug, shrink window so variable information is no longer visible.

Reason>>> I'm not sure who is responsible for this, or if there is
anything to do about it at all.

 I've added the following quick fix:
 
  - When paused at a right paren, right-clicking on the green arrow
 offers the option to "print return value to console".  The output goes
 to the user thread's (current-error-port) and is prefixed by " ###
 DEBUGGER: " to distinguish it from the program's own output.
 
 - When paused anywhere and mousing over a bound variable (not
 top-level), right-clicking similarly offers the option to print the
 variable's value to the console.
 
 Should I commit this?  I'm open to other suggestions, but it's
 probably not a good time for ambitious extensions.
 
 Greg

Reason>>> added menu items to print return and variable values to the
console (Interactions window)


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 14:43:16 -0500
Reason>>> fixed, i believe
