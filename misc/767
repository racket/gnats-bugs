MS Windows NT
>Description:
System:
	 Pentium running NT4 (French) with SP3 installed, 
         Connected to a netware 4.10 server using the Microsoft client for Netware	 
	 NT is installed on the local harddisk and all the application are installed on the server.


Installation probleme: 
	At the making of the .zo files it's give:
 		Could not execute the external program W:\WIN32\PLT\Setup PLT.exe
	But i can run it manually.

If i do that DrScheme give me the error " Error initializing, 
  reference to undefined identifier: define-argument-list" when loading."

If i don't do the Setup PLT, DrScheme work fine.
