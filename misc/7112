>Description:
On line 13 of sgl's makefile.ss, the hardcoded paths
'("/usr/X11R6/include" "/usr/X/include") appear.  This is a
problem for me since I install my X to a different location.
The include paths should instead be determined by configure.
I had to manually work around the issue by editing the
makefile.ss file to match what I told configure.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install or move X to somewhere other than /usr/X11R6/ or
/usr/X/ then attempt to compile and install PLT-scheme.  The
build will fail on sgl.
