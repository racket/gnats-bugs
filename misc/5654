I just checked out the exp-tagged plt source code and attempted to build it in place.  As such, I specified only the --enable-dynlib argument to configure.  The build fails with the following error:

Repeating the process specifying a --prefix of the current directory (as an absolute path) works nicely.

At the very least, a note in src/README explaining this limitation would be nice.

 Well, there's this note in src/README, but I think it's difficult to
 find:
 
     The --enable-dynlib flag works only when `configure' is called
     using an absolute path, or when an absolute path is provided with
     --prefix.
 
 I'll try to make it more prominent.

 Duh.  Yes, I did see that; thanks.
 
 Just out of curiosity, what are the benefits of building dynamic
 libraries?  Do they simply make it easier to incorporate MzScheme and
 MrEd inside C programs, or what?

 Yes, that's all.
 
 There's more benefit in Windows and Mac OS. In that case, "launchers"
 such as DrScheme and Help Desk are applications that dynamically link
 to MzScheme and MrEd. That makes them cooperate better with the
 desktop.
