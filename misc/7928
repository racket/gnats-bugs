One of my students recently had a program that was correct.  The program was not recognizing any of the symbols in the program (didn't see them as defined).  After deleting all of them and retyping them the same identical way the program ran.  No changes in the program were made other than this.

 Do you know if the student was trying to use the Help Desk?  In some
 places the documentation of procedures contains characters that look
 like spaces but they're not really spaces, so if you copy text from
 the help desk you might end up with something that looks ok but is
 not.

 I didn't know that it was fixed -- but the PR was from 299.400, maybe
 that was pre-fix?

 In this case there is not much that we can do, unless you can find a
 way to replicate it, or if you remember any new details that will help
 locating the problem.

 I can't recall clearly, but that could easily be post-fix.
 
 This PR is pretty vague ...

 Yes, I've asked him for more details, so it can be closed if doesn't
 cope up with anything.
