>Description:
default-load-handler: expected only a `module' declaration for `tester-controller', but found an extra expression in: /usr/lib/plt/collects/tests/tester/private/tester-controller.ss

Somehow, a definition of "my-expand" got appended to file "tests/tester/private/tester-controller.ss" outside of the module form.

Reason>>> Looks like this is Jacob's code (also looks like this
problem is fixed but he should verify that).  Maybe I should
add a gnats account for him?

 works.
