DrScheme launches fine under MacOS X on intel and ppc platforms
However the file org.plt-scheme.prefs.ss cannot be written.  An
errno=16 Resource busy error is obtained and a TMP file is stored
in the ~/Library/Preferences directory.  The users account is on
an SMB file server and not on the mac.  Every time DrScheme launches
another TMP file is created with the same error message.
There is no problem in saving files under Drscheme - they get written
without any problems.

acknowledge the error and the Preferences window opens.
Modify preferences and upon saving the error occurrs again

 Is the directory ~/Library/Preferences generally writable by the user?
 Does this program (when run in the graphical or mzscheme language
 levels) work?
 
   (call-with-output-file "~/Library/Preferences/test-file"
     (lambda (port) (display "hi\n" port))
     'truncate)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Mon, 16 Oct 2006 23:59:45 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 16 Oct 2006 23:59:45 -0400
Reason>>> The OSX installer has been significantly simplified, and it
is now a drag+drop installation.  If there is still an issue
with this in v352 and up, then please re-open this report.
Thanks.
