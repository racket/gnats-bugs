>Description:
`plot-frame' is a very convenient helper that makes it easy to replace
dirty gnuplot scripts, but it could use some improvements:

* The click-to-get-back to the previous zoom interface makes sense for
  snips, but with a dedicated frame (or other cases where it's not a
  snip inside some editor), it could use more intuitive interface like
  some right-click dialog, or maybe ctrl+wheel to zoom in/out.

* It could also bind some useful keys like escape-to-close.

* The resulting frame can be resized, but the plot in it doesn't change.
  It would be very nice (and expected) if the plot was resized when the
  frame is resized.

 It's *always* a snip inside some editor. (I couldn't figure out a way to 
 abstract drawing and interaction in a way that I could use it both in a 
 snip and a custom canvas.) But I think the only thing I can't do with a 
 snip is catch mouse wheel events.
 
 That being said, `plot-frame' creates the editor. The editor could catch 
 mouse wheel events and send them to the snip.
 
 FWIW, I've been considering forward/back or undo/do buttons for 
 navigating zoom history. They would only appear when the mouse is 
 hovering over the plot.

 I'll do that today, once I figure out how. What's the easiest way?
 
 Would you like any other keys bound? Left/right to navigate zoom history?

 I have this fixed locally, and I'm pushing it today.

 Yes, that's what I thought would be better -- since there's no reason
 to use a snip in a standalone plot-in-a-frame.

 (Sounds like hacking around it...)

 That would be nice to have for the interactions (and for mouse
 interactions in a standalone frame), but for a frame having keys would
 be very nice too.  (But yeah, I'm just playing a spoiled kid now.)

 Arrow keys would be nice to use to just navigate around when you're
 zommed in...  So maybe Alt-left/right?  Or maybe dump the idea of
 saving the zoom history and instead just have zoom-in/-out operations?
 Maybe in the snip version too?
