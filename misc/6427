 Sorry for the quip. Here is what I meant: 
 
 1. In case you don't know, it is provably impossible to detect whether
 or not a program applied to some inputs is in an infinite loop. I usually
 cover this in my freshman course. 
 
 2. In case this is your first course on programming, either read How to
 Design Programs in parallel, or if your course uses it, pleasepleaseplease
 follow the design recipes.
