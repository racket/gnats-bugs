>Description:
My email address appears in the documentation for the paint by numbers example. Since this documentation is accessible from the web (at http://download.plt-scheme.org/scheme/plt-clean-cvs/collects/games/paint-by-numbers/doc.txt and http://download.plt-scheme.org/scheme/plt/collects/games/paint-by-numbers/doc.txt) my email has been harvested, and I've started receiving spam with spoofed from addresses which also appear in the documentation. If possible, I'd appreciate it if you'd remove my email address from all your documentation.
Thanks.

 Would you be happier with `adjusting at yahoo dot com'?

 I have removed his email from the list and slightly obfuscated the
 others. This is checked into CVS, but I did not do anything with the
 web.

 OK.

 No need for anything, if it's exp-tagged then it will propagate out on
 the next nightly build.
