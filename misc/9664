>Description:
I just type:

(require scheme/mpair)
(mlist 1 2 3)

but interpteter shows me error:

"The evaluation thread is no longer running, so no evaluation can take place until the next execution.
The program ran out of memory"

I've tested it on WindowsXP and Slackware Linux 12.1 - result is the same.
Memory option for DrScheme - 256mb.

P.S. I coudn't post it via DrScheme bugform because I have internet through HTTP Proxy with auth.
P.P.S. excuse me for my english - I'm not a native.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) run DrScheme
2) select Swindle as language
3) type 
(require scheme/mpair)
(mlist 1 2 3)
4) press enter
5) look at error window :)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Fri, 08 Aug 2008 06:31:49 -0400
Reason>>> swindle

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 08 Aug 2008 06:31:49 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in svn.
(The problem was that swindle couldn't print mlists.)
