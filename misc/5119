Dr. Scheme halts on its splash screen.  I've tried to launch it from various places, even the command prompt and it basically doesnt get past the splash screen.  I've had no problems running it on windows me and on unix, but I've tried it on two computers running xp and have had the same problem.  If you could help me out, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks

 I haven't tried v103p1 on XP, but v200alpha12 runs fine.
 
 Although it's an alpha version, it's very stable.  Look at

 Another thing you can try is to use Windows' `Search' utility to look
 for files named `mred.pre' and `mred.ini'.  Delete those files, and
 restart DrScheme.
 
 Please let me know if this helps.
