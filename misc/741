Check syntax on interactions-less frame produces an internal error.

(I recall that there is some reason you can't check syntax in
an interactions-less frame, but an internal error is not an
appropriate response.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Select File|New
Click "Check Syntax" in the new frame

 But 652 is closed!!!!!
 
 I see this on both Xt and Windows versions. Is it possible that
 something is not gettig updated right? Is it possibly different due to
 a preference setting?

 What's the error message? Can you package up your .mred.prefs for me?

 I advocate a policy of creating a new PR when a bug is re-encountered
 after the PR is closed. I think it's fair for me to look at all the
 open PRS when Iwant to file a new one, but not fair to look at all 700
 old ones. A PR handler can, of course, switch the open states around
 if he wishes, butit doesn't make sense for the PR reported to do that.

 That seems reasonable. I never intended to force you to look thru all 00
 some prs when you wnat to file one. Just the one (that I found) in this caes.
