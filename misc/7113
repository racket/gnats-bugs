>Description:
I am building dr scheme on my FC2 x86_64. There seems to be some files missing from the src distribution.

first: 
default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/usr/local/plt/collects/sgl/gl-Vectors/gl-double-vector.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

later:
setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for sgl (/usr/local/plt/collects/sgl)
setup-plt:   default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/usr/local/plt/collects/sgl/gl-vectors/gl-double-vector.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

I think that these are scheme source code files that should be incuded in the downloaded source. right?? if not what am I doing wrong??

Reason>>> sgl (probably irrelevant)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by sowens at Wed, 23 Feb 2005 15:09:31 -0500
Reason>>> SGL works differently now
