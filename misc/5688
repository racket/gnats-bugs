>Description:
When you create an executable from a scheme file using the menu command, the file that is created cannot be run.  An error comes up saying the file name exceeds 1024 characters.  The file name/path listed also does not make sense.  There are a lot of dots in the path, and it doesn't appear to point to a folder/file that actually exists.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a .scm file within DrScheme.  Click the make executable menu command.  Try to run the executable.

 Thanks for the report!
 
 It would be great if you could supply a little bit more information
 with this PR. Is it possible to attach the executeable it created or
 send us the exact error message? I'm pretty sure that I know what is
 going wrong, but it would be nice to have verification.
 
 Also, does it work for you to submit the bug report via Help Desk?
 There should be a link on the front of Help Desk saying "Submit a Bug
 Report". If so, it would be great if you did that too -- Help Desk
 tells us lots of information about your particular PLT installation and
 machine that is also helpful in tracking down the problem.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Actually, based on the description in your bug report, I'm absolutely
 certain of the cause. No need to gather more information.
 
 This problem has been fixed for version 201 (to be released soon).
 
 Again, thanks for the report!
 
 Matthew
