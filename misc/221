>Description:
	Some fonts I choose from the fonts dialog don't come out right,
they come out as white on white.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Set the modern font to -jis-fixed and open a scheme file. Or, just
use this line in your .mred.resources:

mred.ScreenModern__:    -jis-fixed

Also:

> (car (member "-jis-fixed" (wx:get-font-list)))
"-jis-fixed"

This is the correct behavior. -jis-fixed is a Japanese font and
the roman characters are blank.
