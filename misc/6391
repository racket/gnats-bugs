>Description:
I have discovered a quick-sort function
in the language, which seems to be correct.

It has the signature
  (quicksort (listof X) (X X -> boolean) -> (listof X)
unlike the documented function
  quick-sort : (X X  ->  boolean) (listof X)  ->  (listof X)

If this is in the known mistakes, then it is well hidden :-)
>How-To-Repeat:
(quicksort (list 1 0 2 9 3 8 4 5 7 6) > )
(quick-sort < (list 1 0 2 9 3 8 4 5 7 6))
