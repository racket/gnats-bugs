>Description:
I ran Matthew's lang-as-os slideshow, from the command line and from within DrScheme.  At the point where one can click an Eval link to cause Hello, Hola, Goodbye and Ciao to print in the lower-left corner of the screen, slideshow crashes.  DrScheme is still running, and the little window (Hello and Hola in black, Goodbye and Ciao in red) is still there, but slideshow is gone.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Mon, 24 Sep 2007 18:42:56 -0400
Reason>>> slideshow



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:02 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
