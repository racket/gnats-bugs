>Description:
The documentation of lazy racket seems to be somewhat misleading:
 cycle : procedure?
Creates a lazy infinite list given a list of elements to repeat in order.

I interpreted "given a list of elements" as a single parameter of type "list?".
But the procedure takes an arbitrary number of arguments to be combined into a ring list.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (define p (cycle '(1 2 34 5)))
> (car p)
'(1 2 34 5)
> (take 4 p)
'((1 2 34 5) . #<promise:...llects/lazy/lazy.rkt:580:37>)

a very surprising result

(define pp (cycle 
   1 2 34 5))

(car pp)
-> 1
