>Description:
Change line 309 of PLT/collects/eopl/datatype.ss
from 

 (error 'case "not a ~a: ~s" 

to

 (error 'cases "not a ~a: ~s" 

because this is about the cases form, not
about the "case" construct.

The current error message is confusing, especially for
students learning cases for the first time.
