>Description:
The tests for sandbox.ss create /tmp/sandbox-test.ss, but don't remove the final version of it, so subsequent runs by a different user on the same machine won't be able to overwrite it and will report a spurious error.
>How-To-Repeat:
From collects/tests/mzscheme, run:

mzscheme -f sandbox.ss

Then check for /tmp/sandbox-test.ss (including its modification date).
