 Eli,
 
 I don't understand.  I just opened up a fresh DrScheme under Windows,
 in Language Level Quasi-R4RS, and typed
 
   (require-library "trace.ss")
 
 and got no error at all.  trace and untrace work fine, too.
 
 I did the same in DrScheme Jr, and it works likewise.
 
 (Incidentally, I recommend you use reference-library instead of
 require-library, but that works just as well.)
 
 What are we doing differently?
