>Description:
When loading the cards library in the games collection,
it evaluates (current-load-relative-directory) in the
body of the unit, which is wrong. It should (if it *must*)
evaluate that when the file is loaded, not when the
unit is invoked.

Alternatively, why not use (collection-path ...)?
>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "sig.ss" "games" "cards")
(invoke-unit/sig
  (compound-unit
    (import)
    (link [w : wx^ (wx@)]
          [c : mzlib:core^ ((require-library "corer.ss"))]
          [m : mred^ ((require-library "linkwx.ss" "mred") core wx)]
          [d : cards^ ((require-library "cardr.ss" "games" "cards")
                       w m (c function@))])
    (export)))

; please forgive any mistakes. I am typing this in from
; memory. The general idea is to create a unit that links
; and invokes the cardr.ss library.

; the actual error message is "wx:bitmap%: expected positive size, got 0"
; or something like that.

Yes - it shoudl use collection-path. load-relative was leftover from
the pre-unitized, pre-collection days
