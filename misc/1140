See the summary.

Also : in v53, the function.ss was already loaded. How can I incorporate
its functions foldl, foldr and filter through a teaching library ? It is
usable within the library, but not in the top-level env.
When does the "Check Syntax" button does not appear ? Does it appear
only in "debug" mode ?
Thanks.
