>Description:
Feature Request for DrScheme 4

An extended build dialog should allow inclusion of resources (like application and document icons for MrEd, internationalization constants, and other arbitrary read-only data used by the application) and have checkboxes for the target platforms of stand-alone executables. The generated executables should include the specified resources and work out-of-the-box on the target platform, preferably without any additional installation. If installation is absolutely necessary, the executable should start a platform-compliant installer upon first launch and launch the final standalone executable after successful installation. ('platform-compliant' meaning in this case what people are used to, e.g. the Apple installer used by DrScheme on OS X)

Suggestion for the additional resources: Copy every *visible* file that is in a "Resources" folder in the source directory to a folder that is somehow bundled with the executable and make (find-system-path 'resources) return this bundled copy when called from the generated standalone executable, but return (built-path (current-directory) "Resources") when it is not called from within a standalone executable. There should also be a runtime test for determining whether the application is a standalone executable or not.

 Is the programmatic interface to these operations lacking, somehow?

 Document icons and things like that, which are related to the OS, could
 be supported better in the GUI. For now, we have left it to the Scheme
 API.
 
 For other resources, the right thing is to use `define-runtime-path'.
 (See "runtime-path.ss" in MzLib.) It solves both the problems of how to
 include the files in a distribution and how to find the files at run
 time.

 Ah, I finally understand what you mean: being able to build a Windows
 distribution from a Mac OS X machine, for example.
 
 Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Just being able
 to create consistent single-platform distributions and to create
 executables for the current platform is as much as we can manage right
 now.
