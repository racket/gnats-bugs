>Description:
(I also noticed this under windows last night). When I start up help-desk
and click on the "installed manuals" link on the front page, I don't get
any feedback that I actually clicked (encouraging me to click again, and
again...). Eventually, help desk goes to the page, tho.
>How-To-Repeat:
start up help desk (with default stuff installed)
click "installed manuals"
no watch
>Fix:
