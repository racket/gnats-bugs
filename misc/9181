>Description:
Trying to figure out how to call C / COM / other external code, I browsed the documentation to find the FFI docs. I get the following error, though:

File not found: C:\other\plt\doc\foreign/foreign.html

The corresponding directory in disk is almost empty:

/c/other/plt/doc/foreign$ ls
hdindex  keywords
/c/other/plt/doc/foreign$ 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Go to PLT Help Desk home
2. Click on Reference: Libraries link
3. Click on PLT MzLib: Libraries Manual link
4. Scroll down to foreign.ss: Foreign Interface link and click
5. Click on PLT Foreign Interface Manual link
6. Observe error:
File not found: C:\other\plt\doc\foreign/foreign.html
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 06 May 2008 14:36:46 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 May 2008 14:36:46 -0400
Reason>>> There is some problem there, but it is irrelevant now, since
in svn (to be released as v4 soon) the documentation system
is completely new.
