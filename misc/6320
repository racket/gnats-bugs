>Description:
By analogy, I discovered (stop), which makes the draw.ss canvas go away.

Before doing (start ...), (draw-solid-line ...) causes an error.

After doing (stop), it doesn't cause an error, but also doesn't draw the line, because there is no canvas.

Yes, I often find trivial errors :-)
>How-To-Repeat:
(draw-solid-line (make-posn 100 100) (make-posn 200 500) 'blue)
   ; error ; correct
(start 300 300)
(stop)
   ; canvas disappears
(draw-solid-line (make-posn 100 100) (make-posn 200 500) 'blue)
   ; no error ; no line; incorrect

>Fix:
stop now resets the functions as well as the canvas.
