>Description:
Typing this code:
(define (nested-list-depth nlon)
  (cons [(empty? nlon) 1]
        [(list? (first nlon))
         (+ 1 (nested-list-depth (first nlon))
            (nested-list-depth (rest nlon)))]
        [else (+ 0 (nested-list-depth (rest nlon)))]))

returns error:
function call: expected a name after an open parenthesis, but found something else

highlighted this part in my code:
(empty? nlon)

however this code works in the same program:
(define (nested-list-size nlon)
  (cond [(empty? nlon) 0]
        [(list? (first nlon))
         (+ (nested-list-size (first nlon))
            (nested-list-size (rest nlon)))]
        [else (+ 1 (nested-list-size (rest nlon)))]))

type in the code listed above and hit execute

 You have cons when you mean cond.

 Do you see any reasonable fix to this problem? All I can see is perhaps 
 something based on [] vs ().

 (cons [(empty? nlon) ...] ...)
 should be
 (cond [(empty? nlon) ...] ...)

Edit:

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by eli at Tue, 06 Apr 2004 21:11:51 -0400
Reason>>> Not a bug

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Apr 2004 21:11:51 -0400
Reason>>> This is a feature of the language levels -- they prevent 
obvious mistakes beginners do, as with the `cons' code.  
The `cond' form is completely different, and it does 
expect clauses.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Sun, 02 May 2004 12:50:08 -0400
Reason>>> .
