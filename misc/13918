The program below fails with:

/Users/endobson/tmp/tmp2.rkt:8:26: foo: expected args
  at: #f
  in: (foo a1 . #f)

   /Users/endobson/proj/racket/plt/racket/collects/syntax/parse/private/runtime-report.rkt:31:0
   /Users/endobson/tmp/tmp2.rkt: [running body]

It is not expecting an args at #f it is expecting an args at (a1 . #f). 
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require syntax/parse)

(define-splicing-syntax-class args
  (pattern (~seq arg1:id arg2:id arg3:id)))

(syntax-parse #'(foo a1 . #f)
  [(_ :args) #f])

 Perhaps your subject line is wrong but I would like an error message here that says the form foo has the wrong sub-shapes.

 The bug was meant to convey that the description in "expected <>" and
 the form it is reporting are not in agreement. I did not mean to imply
 that I wanted it to report in terms of the whole form as being wrong,
 I want it to continue to say that '#f' is the problem but with a
 better description. So I believe we are in a agreement.

 Is there any progress on this/or a workaround?
