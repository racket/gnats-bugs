>Description:
	
DrScheme consumes too many colors for an 8-bit display.

Even with no color hog running (no netscape, ghostview, xv, etc),
I get this on aten (8-bit color xterm) when starting drscheme:

  wxColour: Colour allocation failed, using black.
  (Future allocations may fail without reports.)

Just to be sure, I logged out and restarted my X session, and I get the
same problem with only xterms and xclock running.

I don't see where drscheme needs to grab > 200 colors on startup.
But it's especially silly that it does it in a way that it runs
itself out of colors.

And it really is drscheme (or mred) that's grabbing all the colors.
I can run xcmap, start drscheme, and all 256 entries change.
Then, with drscheme still running, xv can't get any new colors.
After quitting drscheme, xv can get all 250 colors.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
Start drscheme -x on an 8-bit display.

 I agree. I had planned to suggest that we switch to a PLT logo image
 that uses exactly four colors (black, white, red, and blue) instead of
 the current 256. This is easy to generate now that we have a
 PostScript description of the logo.
 
 Actually, I had planned to simply make the change this weekend and
 then see if anyone objected. :)
