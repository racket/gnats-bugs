 First, are you really using Windows 3.1 (as opposed to Windows 95)?
 DrScheme only runs on WIndows 95 or NT.
 
 Second, after you click on "Download", you get a new web page with
 just a few lines of text, right? Are you clicking on the link there
 with the right mouse button to select "download link"?
