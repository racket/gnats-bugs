>Description:
I updated my CVS installation of PLT Scheme, downloaded the pre-built binaries, and ran setup-plt -c.  I can run mzscheme:



dbtucker@church:exp/bin> mzscheme

Welcome to MzScheme version 200alpha13, Copyright (c) 1995-2002 PLT

> ^D



but I get this error trying to start drscheme:



dbtucker@church:exp/bin> drscheme

 Something must have gone wrong with "setup-plt -c". When you run
 "setup-plt", does it report the version as 200alpha13? And does it
 report that it deletes all the old files before building new ones?

 You need to run:
 
   setup-plt -c
 
 there are more detailed instructions on:
