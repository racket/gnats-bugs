>Description:
Hi, I was a Scheme fan in the past and I've only just heard about PLT scheme.
I'm so excited to start writing in it I can hardly wait!

It took me a long time to figure out what a .plt file is.
The DrScheme and MzScheme documentation index has entries describing 
.scm, .sch, .bak, and .ss format, but not .plt. Could you please
mention this somewhere in the documentation? "The PLT Scheme Libraries
And Extensions" document in Help Desk would be one good place to put this.

I want to write FastCGI web services in Scheme. Hasn't anyone ever 
tried to do this?

I downloaded fastcgi.plt from http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/develop/ 
but it won't load. fastcgiu.ss contains (require-library "mimes.ss" "net")
and there's no such file in the net library.

I went to www.fastcgi.com. They list many languages, but not Scheme.
You should write them (robs@chelsea.net) and suggest they add PLT Scheme!

I tried to find documentation for the Web and Net collections.
I looked in "The PLT Scheme Libraries And Extensions" document 
in Help Desk. How come this doesn't display the doc.txt for each 
collection? That would really be helpful.

State-Changed-Why:
    Hi,
    
    We've corrected the missing ".plt" entry in the docs for
    v200.
    
    The FastGCI package apparently relies on Francisco's
    mime.plt package, which is available from the same place 
    as fastcgi.plt.
    
    doc.txt files for collections are listed on the "Manuals"
    page, but putting a link from the "Libraries and Extensions"
    page is a good idea.
    
    
    Thanks for the feedback,
    Matthew
