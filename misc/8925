 The autocompleter code uses the text% method find-wordbreak% in 'caret
 mode to find the beginning of the word. I used 'caret mode only
 because the others didn't seem to behave correctly. Robby: is there
 some other way of finding a wordbreak that the code ought to be using?

 Probably you should use Scheme mode's colorer to look backwards one
 token before and then make sure that token is a symbol.

 I don't understand why such a heavy solution is necessary. Don't I
 want to be finding exactly the same text snippet that
 shift+alt-leftarrow would select?

 And what do you think shift-alt-leftarrow does?! (I'll tell you -- it
 does something more complex that what I suggested you do -- it matches
 parenthesis. What I suggested is only one part of that, namely finding
 a single token.)
 
 Also, what do you mean by heavy?

 Probably useful for making an editor for English, I guess.
 
 When editing drscheme programs, the whole file is read (not parsed per
 se) continuously already. So its no additional weight.

 I would have assumed it just scanned backwards and forwards until it
 found a word-breaking character sequence, and that it did so by
 calling something like find-wordbreak in 'caret mode. From that
 perspective needing to have a parse of the whole file seems heavy.
 
 So I'm curious: if find-wordbreak ... 'caret isn't used for moving the
 caret, what is it for?

 How does this sound: you add a method that I can override to change
 the word-break searching behavior and I'll override it. Please also
 supply docs ala the files I pointed you to earlier.

 That'd be fine, there's already a method for that so I just needed to
 make it public. I've done that --- get-text-at, which takes an integer
 (editor position) and returns a string (the prefix that we think the
 user wants completed). I'm going to do the documentation now.

 Oh, right. I remember -- we email'd Matthew a strange program and then
 didn't hear back from him.
 
 Matthew? Do you know what this is about? I can find the program again,
 if it would help.

 Oh, thanks!
 
 Jacob: the get-a<complete> still just completes from the "a" onwards,
 so I guess there's still a change to be made to the completer?

 There still seems to be a problem, actually --- now it appears that
 find-wordbreak doesn't ever find a word if the starting point of the
 backwards search is at the end of the word, only if it's in the
 middle.
 
 Here's code that illustrates what I mean:
 
 (module tmp mzscheme
  (require (lib "class.ss")
           (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
 
   (define t (new text%))
 
   (send t insert "ab")
 
   (define (check p)
     (let ([start-pos (box p)])
       (send t find-wordbreak start-pos #f 'selection)
       (printf "~s\n" (send t get-text (unbox start-pos) p))))
 
   (check 2) ; t is "ab". this prints "", I would expect "ab"
   (check 1) ; t is "ab". this prints "a" as I would expect
   (send t insert " ")
   (check 2) ; t is "ab ". this prints "", I would expect "ab"
   (send t delete 2 3)
   (send t insert "b")
   (check 2) ; buffer is "abb". this prints "ab" as I would expect.
 )

 The latest message from Jacob suggests that find-wordbreak is the
 wrong thing for him to use. From what I can tell, that's a good answer
 from find-wordbreak (if, say, you're implementing line-breaking).
 
 So, maybe it is time for you to use colorer.

 I'm willing to buy that. I've already exposed the hook you asked me to
 for this purpose; it's called "get-word-at".
