This is a simple window for evaluating MrEd Scheme expressions.
Quit now and run DrScheme to get a better window.
The current input port always returns eof.

 get-panel-background doesn't exist, yet. Any idea whether I
 accidentally exp-tagged new MrEd sources, or whether you accidentally
 checked out untagged sources?
 
 (It looks to me like the right version is tagged, but maybe I'm
 misreading the logs.)
 
 Maybe it's a moot point. I'll probably release 100/38 right away...
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
