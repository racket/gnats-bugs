>Description:
The contract on rackunit checks is void?, while the contract of current-check-around is (-> (-> any) any). Looking at the code of define-check, all checks eventually evaluate to an expression that looks like ((current-check-around) (lambda () ...)). Thus sometimes checks can return values other than void, notably #t for some passing tests in test-begin.

I am trying to correct the typed/rackunit library and this is causing problems. So I am wondering is the implementation correct or is the documentation right?
>How-To-Repeat:
(check-equal? 1 1)
(test-begin
 (check-equal? 1 1))
