>Description:
Yeah, tell me about it. Today is an endless series of little cuts. No
one of them hurts but add them up ....

Anyways, I think it is an easy job as long as the only thing in there
are actual keyword-type things. It may be real work if there is some
segregation that needs to happen.

You can search in help desk for "keywords" and for "hdindex" to see
the format of the files. They may be different.
