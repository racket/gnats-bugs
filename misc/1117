 i fixed that on monday afternoon (again) and checked in a new version: 
 
   Welcome to DrScheme, version 100.
   Language: Intermediate.
   > (repl f)
   repl: procedure of two arguments expected as first argument; given procedure of 1 arguments

 Please donwload the real 100. And close the PR while you're at it.

 I checked the bug still exists (again). I have revision 1.4 or error-lib.ss and revision 1.3 of
 guess-lib.ss. They are the latest exp-tagged revisions and they contain bugs.
 
 More of the same kind of bugs in that lib:

 Matthias doesn't exp-tag his files.

 1. It's revision 1.4 of guess-lib that you need. 
 
 2. I think the libs are exp tagged (I did cvs -F exp ...)

 Ok. 1.3 is, in fact, the latest exp tagged revision.

 They aren't. If you did the above command, cvs would have given an error. Perhaps you can try again?

 Robby, could you do the following: 
 
   in emacs on cs: pushd ~scheme/plt/lib/teach/
   then open guess-lib.ss 
 
 My emacs says that it's revision 1.4 that I am opening. 
 
 Here is what I get with cvs tag: 
 
   europa.rice.edu 251> cvs tag -F exp guess-lib.ss 
   T guess-lib.ss
   europa.rice.edu 252> 
 
 It doesn't look like a mistake to me. Why don't you explain things to me
 when I get in?

 The above message means that it wasn't tagged (there wouldn't be a "T"
 line if it was already tagged) and that it is now tagged.
