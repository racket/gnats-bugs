>Description:
Sir,
    My main problem, as an software test engineer, developer, and former educator, is the general lack of good documentation.  The on-line manuals (up to 137 pages) that I have seen are the syntax / instruction set which is useful to the expert.  Real people (novices)- the people tyring to learn this language, learn by example yet virtually every source of documentation I have seen has none or syntax only.  WTFO?????  Every college text book or text book at Barnes & Nobles etc are loaded with example programs.  Many even provide full CD's of examples.  The reason why, because that is the best way to teach and document!!!!  Oh, there is and occasional example, but they are few and very far between. PLEASE PLEASE add more in latter documentation, or if there is a site that I have missed, please provide a URL. 

Thank you very much!

    Thanks for the feedback.
    
    You're right that the reference manuals do not
    have many examples. We are working on other
    materials designed more for learning. Here's a preview,
    though there's not yet enough there to be useful:

    We will also continue to add examples to the
    reference documentation.
