>Description:
what if along with :
(define-struct x (y z))
make-x
x-y 
x-z
x? 

we have

(define-struct x (y z))
x.make
x.y
x.z
x.?

I think this is not so impossible in Scheme.

this could make easier transition 
to and most important FROM other 
languages.

thanks 
best regards

 With all due respect; I think this would increase confusion, rather 
 than decreasing it.  In most C-like languages, the suffix 
 ".<field-name>" is appended to the name of a variable bound to an <x>, 
 rather than to the name "x" itself.  That is, a programmer from such a 
 language would expect to type "x-instance.y", rather than "(x.y 
 x-instance)".
 
 Thanks for your suggestion, though.
