>Release:        August 1997
>Environment:
MS Windows 95
>Description:
A scheme file included code that opened a file for output,
and printed a number of lines of output to it.  In the resulting
file, one line begin in the next column after the end of the previous
column.  Line feed, but no carriage return.  The scheme file was
directed to standard input:

mzscheme < hello.scm

A version of the code that used fprintf with "~%" and another that
used (newline port) exhibited the same behavior.

Also, read-line works differently between Unix and Win95.  On Win95,
(read-line port) consumes the text up to the newline, but leaves the newline
unread, and the next read-line consumes only the newline.  On Unix, the
newline characer is consumed with the first read-line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a program to read names from a file, one name to a line, left-justified;
e.g.

John
Paul
George
Ringo

and emit the same names, with hellos in front and periods behind.

Hello, John.
Hello, Paul.
etc.

Make the inputs from and outputs to named files.

The behaviors of printing newlines and reading lines can be seen to be
different between the two systems.  At least, for the Win95 on my machine.

I can supply the scheme code if you need it, but don't have it handy now.

State-Changed-Why:

By default, files are opened for "binary mode" reading and writing.
To open a file for text mode (which will print CRLF for newline
and read CRLF as a single newline under Windows), use the 'text flag:

   (open-output-file "file" 'text)
or (open-input-file "file" 'text)
etc.
