 Do you mean an `atom?' predicate?  It isn't in R5RS.
 
 It's easy enough to write one, of course.

 This kind of question should probably be addressed to a newsgroup such
 as comp.lang.scheme, or the PLT Scheme mailing list.
 
 See http://www.plt-scheme.org/features/support/ for details about the
 PLT Scheme mailing list.
 
 Why do you need an atom? predicate? I'm guessing you're taking a class
 using The Little Schemer as a textbook.  Am I correct?
