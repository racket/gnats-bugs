 This is a problem of your language level settings.  DrScheme has
 several such levels that are intended for students who are new to the
 language, they are all restricted at varying degrees.  One such
 restriction in the beginner level is that quote can only be used with
 symbols, otherwise, students should use (list 2 3 5), or move to a
 different level.
