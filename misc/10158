>Description:
Hi,

I found a tiny typo and a couple of omissions in the page:

http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/Building_New_Contract_Combinators.html

First, the typo. In paragraph starting:

"This is not just a cheap trick ..."

The sentence:

"Now, imagine that the providing module invokes the function, suppying it an argument."

has "suppying" in place of "supplying".

Second, the paragraph starting:

"The simplest way to build a contract."

seems to have the above fragment, which should possibly say "This is the ..." or "The above is the ..."

Also, the paragraph:

"Produces an S-expression to be used as a name"

uses the word "parenthesis" in a plural context, suggesting "parentheses".

Cheers (and sorry about being a documentation-botherer),
D
