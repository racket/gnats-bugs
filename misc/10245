>Description:
There are no dict-ref!, dict-has-key?, and dict-copy routines (analogous to hash-ref!, hash-has-key?, and hash-copy).  Otherwise, the dict- functions more or less copy the hash- functions, so it seems sensible to continue the trend.

It looks like dict-copy would require a change to prop:dict, so that one will probably have to be skipped.  However, -ref! and -has-key? can be implemented in terms of the existing -ref and -set!.
