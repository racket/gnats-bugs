>Description:
Enter the code below, `p' gets applied twice on what it should be
applied, which is unexpected, undocumented, and probably inefficient.
But worse on all fronts, `p' is also applied on "huh?" but there is
no reason to try it there since that sublist doesn't begin with `stuff'.

Both problems go away if the (list 'thing thing) pattern is removed.
>How-To-Repeat:
(let ([p (lambda (x) (printf ">>> ~s\n" x))])
  (match '((thing "1") (bleh "huh?") (stuff "2" "3"))
    [(list-no-order (list 'thing thing)
                    (list 'stuff (app p stuffs) ...)
                    _ ...)
     1]))
