>Description:
Some various documentation glitches for Beginning-Student:

Under "list", there are two signatures (one of them is really list* ?)
"<=", "=" both have correct signature (2+ args), but english description says ex
actly two args.

    fixed, except for last one, but I think that it is okay
>Unformatted:
 ">=" says exactly 2 args (both signature and enligsh), though beginner-level rea
 lly does accept multiple args.
 "-", "/" don't really give good descriptions of what happens with 3+ arguments; 
 give a "for example"?
 "-": perhaps give the unary version its own paragraph (since +,*,/ don't even ha
 ve unary versions in beginner)
 "list-ref": documentation mentions an index variable "i", which hasn't been defi
 ned?
 "format" has no helpful documentation; is this intentional?
 "equal?" claims to only compare list, though it works on numbers etc.
 
 In the overall grammar for beginner,
 I don't understand the documenation for [name], which says:
 "If the name matches a defined function, then evaluation of the name causes an e
 rror."
