>Description:
In experimenting with case-lambda forms, I've found that
the use of dot notation seems to be ignored.  In fact, 
the example in the documentation of case-lambda fails 
when called with four or more arguments.  Strangely enough,
it succeeds when called with three.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f
  (case-lambda
    [(x) x]
    [(x y) (+ x y)]
    [(a . any) a]))

    full lang
State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Fri Dec 14 22:48:35 2001
State-Changed-Why:
    The problem is that `.' is parsed as a symbol in Full,
    instead of getting its usual Scheme meaning.
    
    This bug has been fixed for the v200 release.
    
    Thanks for the report!
