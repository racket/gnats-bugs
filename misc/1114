>Description:
Running "./install" on my i586 Linux (kernel version 2.0.32) halted with
the following error message:

 Create .zo files now (y/n)? [y]
bin/setup-plt: /home/mnykanen/plt/.bin/i386-linux-aout/mzscheme: No such file or directory
exec: /home/mnykanen/plt/.bin/i386-linux-aout/mzscheme: cannot execute: No such file or directory

This is because ".bin" consisted of "i386-linux" instead. Changing the name
seems to have solved the problem. (In fact, the fault may well be in my own
system; we have made lots of local tweaks to "standard" Linux here at its
birthplace..)

Finally, thank you for your excellent work!

 The problem is that plt/bin/archsys incorrectly identifies your Linux
 system as an "a.out" system, rather than an "ELF" system. The test for
 ELFness includes various assumptions about a standard system
 configuration, so that's why it failed.
 
 Version 100 included a new-and-improved test, but clearly it's not
 improved enough.
 
 a.out systems are now so few and far between that the `archsys' script
 should probably just assume all Linux 2.X systems are ELF, yes?
 
 Your solution of mving plt/.bin/i386-linux to i386-linux-aout should
 work fine.
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew

I changed archsys to assume ELF for Linux 2.X.
