>Description:
When I select the "new" menu item, I get the following error message in
stdout (and no new window). This appears to be related to the change of
language levels.

ivar/proc: expects type <object> as 1st argument, given: #<undefined>; 
other arguments were: language-changed (apply super-init args) in 
Barbican:plt:collects:drscheme:tools:debug:unit.ss


Then, if you select the "quit" menu item, you get the following error message in stdout:

procedure application: expected procedure, given: #<undefined> (no arguments)

... the second time you quit, it works.


>How-To-Repeat:
start up DrScheme

change the language level

click on execute

select the "new" menu item

click in some non-stdout window

select the "quit" menu item

click on "ok"
