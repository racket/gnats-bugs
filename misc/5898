I work for the IT department of Capilano College in North Vancouver, BC Canada.

We have a simple but annoying problem that we hope you can help us with. 

In a nustshell, we wish to locate the file ".Lockplt-prefs.ss" to a path other than the root of 'C:' where DrScheme currently expects to find it.

Our problem with its current location is that in our computer labs, students currently have only 'read' rights to that path. I tried to find a way to point the program to a different location for that file, but there does not appear to be a way to do it in the user interface. Perhaps there is a switch or something, that can be used when executing the program, that will let us run DrScheme yet not have to open up the root of C to students.

Regards,

Darin Feist

 The lock file should be written in the user's "home" directory.
 
 I guess the way to set the home directory depends on how you manage
 user accounts. Ultimately, I think the HOMEPATH and HOMEDIRVE
 environment variables select the home directory.
 
 Let me know if that doesn't help. I can find a Windows machine and
 investigate further.

    Use reports that setting environment variables did
    the trick. Meanwhile, I've added the name of the lock
    file to the DrScheme documentation, so that a help
    search could conceivably have found the answer.
