>Description:
In node 11 (and probably elsewhere) your references to files are ``filename'' instead of a regular double quote.  I suspect the problem is that the latex->html converter doesn't catch this.  I use LaTex myself and understand that the print version will have normal directional double-quotes when compiled.

I don't suppose the publisher will allow you to have a ps/dvi/pdf version of the website, but it would be nice.

Just wanted you to know,
Michael S. Williamson
