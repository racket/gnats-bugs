 I fixed this in the obviouls way, using `stop?-expr'.
 
 Matthew -- one more thing in this description is that it says:
 
   The @scheme[id]s are then updated with ...
 
 but "updated" seems like it can lead people to believe that they're
 mutated instead of rebound.  I didn't do anything about that since I
 don't know the level of pickiness that you like for these
 descriptions...

 Thanks. I changed that text, and also corrected another typo or two.
