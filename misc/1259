>Description:
The windows installer prompts the user about building
    .zos after it has installed all of the files, rather
    than doing all of the prompting up front.
    
Also, when an error occurs during the Setup PLT (zo creation)
step, Setup PLT says (in big letters) ERROR, but the main
installer script reports success.

 This part is fixed.

 Not sure how to implement this.  Maybe the installer
 could check for the existence of a particular .zo file.
 Of course, that's not guaranteed to give correct results.

 Not sure how to implement this.  Perhaps the installer 
 could check for the existence of a particular file.
 That's not foolproof, however.

 Would you like help from setup plt? Perhaps setup plt can create a file if
 there is an error?

 That would work, since the installer can branch on the existence of a 
 file.  Maybe this should happen on all platforms, in case we ever 
 use installers elsewhere.
