>Description:
Perhaps I'm misreading the documentation, but I'd expect that the two profile reports emitted by the code below would be more or less the same -- in particular, they'd both have entries for functions that add up to about two seconds.  However, as you can see, only the second report looks like that; the first one is effectively empty.
