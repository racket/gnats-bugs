>Description:
DrScheme's "Log Definitions and Interactions" menu
item triggers an exception. The exn mentions the
MrFlow directory, and I didn't try uninstalling MrFlow.

Also, the "Stop logging" button should be labelled
"Stop Logging" (capital "L").

>How-To-Repeat:
Select "Log Definitions and Interactions" from the "File"
  menu
Select a folder
 (Allow its contents to be replaced, if it's empty)
Exception:
 procedure save-file method in e:\matthew\plt\collects\mrflow\snips-and-arrows.ss:264:6: expects 3 arguments, given 2: "E:\\Documents and Settings\\Matthew Flatt\\Des... copy

 In deed, the overridden save-file method in that file should be an
 opt-lambda, as described in the docs.
