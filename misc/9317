 Looking into this, hangman is a syntactic form that at expansion time  
 checks the number of arguments.
 
 I don't think we want check-error to be checking for syntactic errors  
 as well as programmatic ones; however, perhaps things like hangman  
 shouldn't really be syntax at this level.
 
 That being said, there's something else wrong with check-error so  
 don't expect it to work right now; I'll look at it in the morning.

 I agree that hangman is different, but without significant effort  
 (that I don't want to undertake close to the release) I can't catch  
 the error. I can't actually promise without further investigation that  
 I'd be able to distinguish the two circumstances sufficiently to get  
 the desired behavior.
 
 So, in my opinion; the bug stays open but the issue should be tabled  
 for the upcoming release.
