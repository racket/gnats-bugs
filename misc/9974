>Description:
There are two bugs in the library "errortrace-lib.ss". The first one occurs on line 98, and is a type error:

(hash-table-map cmss (lambda (ks v)
					   (cons v 
						 (map (lambda (k)
							(let ([v (cdr (hash-table-get profile-info k))])
							  (list (vector-ref v 2)
                                                                (vector-ref v 3))))
						      ks))))

The type of (hash-table-get profile-info k) is vector, so "cdr"
is invalid.  The program seems to work correctly if the term
(cdr (hash-table-get profile-info k)) is replaced with simply
(hash-table-get profile-info k). Perhaps profile-info used to
be an alist?

Fixing that bug, it becomes possible to see that the output of
the errortrace library is unhelpful:

=========================================================
time = 12 : no. = 20000 : #f in #<syntax>
  20000 VIA 40 <- 1076
=========================================================

The code causing this bug is on line 288:

(printf "time = ~a : no. = ~a : ~e in ~s~n"
                 (cadr c) (car c) (caddr c) (cadddr c))

Replacing (cadddr c) with (syntax-object->datum (cadddr c))
results in output that is better than useless.

The following "diff" output can be used to apply the changes
automatically:

*** errortrace-lib.ss	2008-12-14 13:34:19.000000000 -0500

 In the 3 years since this bug was originally submitted, I have created
 a forked version of the errortrace library. My version, among other
 things, fixes the bug where the time taken by a function is attributed
 not only to that function, but to all the functions above it on the
 call stack. My version pinpoints exactly which function spent the time.
 
 The alternate version also reports the per-profile-point amount of time
 spent in the garbage collector.
 
 Some of the alternate profiler had to be rewritten in C to get acceptible
 performance. 
 
 I have uploaded my work here:
