 Is there a reasonably small program that makes this happen?

 Just found one...
 
 If tests/eli-tester's test form contains unbound identifiers:
 
 test2.ss:
 
 #lang scheme
 (require tests/eli-tester)
 
 (test
  (foo) =3D> "foo")
 
 test1.ss:
 
 #lang scheme
 (require "test2.ss")
 
 Running test1:
 
 ../../../../plt/collects/compiler/cm.ss:184:6: write: cannot marshal
 constant that is embedded in compiled code: #(struct:exn:fail:syntax
 "expand: unbound identifier in module" #<continuation-mark-set>
 (#<syntax:/Users/jay/Dev/svn/byu-plt/trunk/games/mv/test2.ss:5:2>))

 Unless I hear otherwise I going to say that's a bug in eli's macro
 (for generating 3d code).
