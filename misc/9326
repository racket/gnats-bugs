>Description:
According to SRFI 42, this is a legal comprehension:

(list-ec (: c "AbCdEfG")
         (if (char-lower-case? c))
         c)

In #lang mzscheme, it compiles just fine and produces 
(#\b #\d #\f) as I would expect. In #lang scheme/base, however, I get the error:

if: bad syntax (must have an "else" expression) in: (if (do-ec:do (set! result (cons c result))) (char-lower-case? c))

There isn't even good syntax tracking information; when I got the message it was just a bare error with no hint as to where in my 700-line file it was happening.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt at Thu, 15 May 2008 13:00:53 -0400
Reason>>> why not?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 15 May 2008 13:00:53 -0400
Reason>>> hacked SRFI 42 implementation to recognize `if' from both
`mzscheme' and `scheme/base'
