The "round" procedure is unreliable in the sense that it rounds even 
numbers with a decimal of .5 down instead of up. For example, though 3.5 
rounds to 4.0, 2.5 rounds to 2.0.

2.0

4.0

 This is the correct behavior: in the case of X.5, round goes to the
 even number closest to X. Rounding to even is the default IEEE
 rounding mode and is required by the popular Scheme standards (e.g.,
 R4RS).
