In Section 3.6 2D Rectangle Renderers, one of the samples (approximating the area under a curve with a bar chart) references linear-seq which appears to be unbound.

 For this bug and 12435, the two functions `linear-seq' and 
 `bounds->intervals' are in the `plot/utils' module.
 
 That's not very clear in the documentation, though, so I'll add (require 
 plot/utils) to the examples.
 
 Thanks!
