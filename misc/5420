>Environment:
solaris-8
>Description:
The version checker prints out "Details" even when there are no 
details to show.  That's in the text version.  For the GUI version,
probably there should be no "Details" button.

This PR is essentially a memo to myself.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install Solaris 200alpha19 bundle.
