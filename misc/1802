>Description:
slatex the following file: 
\documentclass[11pt]{article}

\usepackage{slatex}

\begin{document}

\begin{schemedisplay}
'(course ((title "Comp210")) "
  " )
\end{schemedisplay}

\end{schemeregion}

\end{document}

The essential part of the translation is: 

\begin{ZZZZschemedisplay}%
'(\cn{course} ((\cn{title} \dt{{\tt\dq}Comp210{\tt\dq}})) {\tt\dq}}\\%
\dt{ \ {\tt\dq}} )
\end{ZZZZschemedisplay}

The extra brace at the end of the first line is the problem.

 Hi John.  I will look into it soon.  Not having
 looked into it yet, I don't want to speculate.
