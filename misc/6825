>Description:
I have been using Dr. Scheme for a month now, and all of a 
sudden it takes about 5 minutes for the program to execute.
Trying to fix the problem, I have restarted my computer and 
closed down everything so that DrScheme was the only thing I
had open. Still it takes forever to show me what I have 
created. What can I do to solve the problem?

 Hello,
 
 Did you check if the problem persists with a newer version of
 DrScheme?
