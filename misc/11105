>Description:
In the slideshow language, the code macro doesn't keep the baseline consistent among the arguments.  This happens on Windows XP SP3.  It looks normal on Ubuntu 10.04.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang slideshow
(require slideshow/code)
(code (a b))

The baseline of the "b" is below the baseline of the "a".  The following example shows that this happens with many letters

(code (a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z))

 This may be a Windows XP-specific problem.  I was able to test on a
 Windows 7 machine, and it works properly on Windows 7.
