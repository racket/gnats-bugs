 Please ignore this message.  I still don't understand what sequence of
 keystrokes and mouse movements made MS IE go to the Submit button
 (which was off-screen) and click on it.  Maybe there's a conspiracy at
 MS to cause extra bug reports for non-MS developers. (-:

 The bug is that a bunch of zeroes is not a valid location, and should
 not change without any user action.

 this is a bad pr. It should be closed/removed. The next pr contains the 
 real thing.
