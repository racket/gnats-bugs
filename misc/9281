Hi!
  I'm trying to port drscheme to Debian ARM EABI (wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort) and it fails to compile, saying:

cc -g -Wall -fPIC -DMZ_USES_SHARED_LIB -I./../mzscheme -I.../drscheme-372/src/foreign/../mzscheme/include -I.../drscheme-372/src/foreign/../mzscheme/src -Igcc/libffi/include -c .../drscheme-372/src/foreign/foreign.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/foreign.o
.../drscheme-372/src/foreign/foreign.c:2467: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'ffi_closure'

because the type "ffi_closure" is only defined in
build/foreign/gcc/libffi/include/ffi.h
(autogenerated from src/foreign/gcc/libffi/include/ffi.h.in)
#if FFI_CLOSURES is defined to non-zero, while
src/foreign/gcc/libffi/src/arm/ffitarget.h has #define FFI_CLOSURES 0

Should the code in foreign.c that tries to use ffi_closure be protected by #if FFI_CLOSURES, or is mzscheme rightly not unusable unless closures are available?

If it's useful, I have a Debian ARM EABI box on the net for developers to use via ssh.

Thanks

 That's something that I thought about adding in the past, but in the
 meanwhile it looks like libffi got updated with support for closures
 on ARM.  So (I hope) the recent code in our repository should work
 fine with the ffi closures.

 That would be interesting to try -- if I can get in I can try to
 compile the subversion tree and see if it goes through.
 
 (If it does, then it would be nice to have an ARM machine in our build
 cycle, but I don't think that we'll have access to one, since we're
 using workstations that people use and I don't think that ARM will get
 into that category...  Maybe (if things do compile) you know of a good
 ARM-based PDA/Phone/whatever that will be able to run mzscheme?  It
 would make it very tempting for me to finally replace my stupid old
 mobile phone and get a little more modern in that department...)

 On old-ABI ARM ("Debian arm"), maybe. But now there is a new EABI
 (used in "Debian armel") that has closures in its list of things that
 don't work yet. We have ffcall to fix, but that is not enough on its
 own cos everyone seems to have their own private copy of libfficall
 (clisp, drscheme...)

 Most have <=64MB RAM, which is sometimes not enough to build things.
 Most serious devs are using Thecus N2100 600MHz, up to 512MB RAM,
 which is what you are welcome to use if you mail me suggesting a user
 name. It's normally on 24/7.

 You're mixing up two different libraries -- `ffcall' is the library
 used by clisp (and written by it's author); we used it at the early
 stages of our foreign-interface project, but had to dump it because
 it's GPL (and we're LGPL).  We now use `libffi' which is maintained
 (partly) in the GCC repository.

 (So I need to wait for more serious handhelds...  Or maybe an emulator
 for building...)

 `eli' would be nice, or `elibarzilay' if you prefer something more
 explicit.  If you do this in the next 45 minutes and mail me some
 random password I'll log in and change it immediately.  (I'm going to
 be in class for 90 minutes then, so I can do that also later today.)
 
 Also tell me if there is any time that you prefer I try the builds so
 I don't hog your cpu when you need it...

Reason>>> I checked it with the newer libffi sources in v4, and it
looks like everything is working fine.  (Sorry to reply
so late...)  There was only one problem in the tests, looks
like some kind of an alignment problem, but I won't be able
to do anything until I have a very accessible arm machine...
