>Description:
Use "Open test Suite" and select a non-test-suite file.
You get an
internal error. The problem is that DrScheme
then doesn't quit when you close the last window. (So Windows users end up with an invisible process.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Choose "Open Test Suite"
Select a file that doesn't contain a test suite
 => internal error
Close the sole DrScheme window
 => process is still running

 Hey Matthew,
 
   What would be the desired effect if the users attempts to open a bad
 test-suite file? I am currently opening up a new test-suite and giving
 a message box saying the file was bad. Should I not open the test-suite
 window?
 
   Also, what exception is being raise within insert-file? There is not
 a list of exceptions that can be raise within insert-file in the docs. I
 am making a with-handler and don't want to catch all exn? exceptions.

 Yes, I think not opening the window would be better.

 There's not a defined set. Any exception is a failure to load the file.
