 Can you explain what you think the problem is?
 
 When I run this program I get this result:
 
 --------------------
 ERROR
 temp1: arity mismatch;
  the expected number of arguments does not match the given number
   expected: 0
   given: 1
   arguments...:
    (exn:fail:contract "application: not a procedure;\n expected a
 procedure that can be applied to arguments\n  given: 'contract\n
 arguments...: [none]" #<continuation-mark-set>)
 
 --------------------
 
 because your program is calling check-exn wrong. The first argument is
 supposed to be an exn predicate that takes one argument, but you have
 gave it a procedure that takes no arguments... which is exactly what
 the error message says.
 
 Is there something else wrong?

 You're right. I must have blacked out or it was fixed independently.
