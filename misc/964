When trying to access docs for toolbox I get an error message saying that the file is not there.  Which is true so where is it?  

I  am  also trying to use the classes  in Dr. Scheme  ex. superclass: mred:console-edit% and I get an error message when I click to find more information on how to apply it.

 The graphical toolbox documentation is not distributed in the standard
 DrScheme archive (because it's too large). You can download this
 documentation it from
 
  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/download.html
 
 Choose "Custom" from the second pop-up menu and choose one of the
 "HTML" options from the third pop-up menu. Then, click the "Download"
 button. The download page will have a link for "PLT MrEd: Graphical
 Toolbox Manual" - that's the one you want.
