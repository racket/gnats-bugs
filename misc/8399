>Description:
The c-printf interface in the ffi collection does not properly 
handle inexact real numbers.

For example, since (integer? 1.0) => #t, the interface will use 
type _int for 1.0 and then raise an error that Scheme->C expects 
type <int32>.

Also, since (complex? 1.1) => #t, the interace will raise an error
that c-printf doesn't know how to deal with 1.1.

I think, but am not sure, that the code in c-printf.ss should be changed from:

(cond [(integer? x) _int]

to:

(cond [(and (integer? x) (exact? x)) _int]

And from:

      [(and (number? x) (not (complex? x)))  _double*]

to:

      [(real? x)  _double*]
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "c-printf.ss" "ffi"))
(c-printf-is-dangerous!)

(c-printf "%f\n" 1.0)
(c-printf "%f\n" 1.1)

 Which values satisfy real? but not number?

 None.  I was just pointint out that checking for `number?' first is
 not necessary.
