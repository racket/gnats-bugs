>Description:
I opened a file in DrScheme by double clicking the file. This resulted in several DrScheme windows being opened. None of the windows had the file in it.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a folder: D:\QA\Shell\Test Documentation\Gamalan\Test Case Tools
2. Place a file in it: test-cases-8.ss
3. Double click the file.

Results:
Four DrScheme windows open.
Two of them have errors in the interactions:
 
>
normalize-path: "D:\\QA\\Shell\\Test Documentation\\Gamalan\\Test Case Tools\\Documentation" (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist

> 
normalize-path: "D:\\QA\\Shell\\Test Documentation\\Gamalan\\Test Case Tools\\Tools" (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist


None of the windows has the document open in it.

 Where did you double-click?  In DrScheme, or 
 Windows Explorer?

Not able to reproduce this one. I suspect it was a problem
with an intermediate installer.
