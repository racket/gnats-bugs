I donwloaded the file

http://www.ai.mit.edu/extra/icfp-contest/pltgui.tgz

from the ICFP Functional Programming Contest '98 site.
Then, I downloaded DrScheme (Version 101 for i386Linux2.0(ELF)) from

http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/download.html

and installed it properly 
[(call-with-current-continuation procedure?) worked ;-)].
When I wanted to start the fp-contest GUI, it complained about a
reference to an unknown identifier `invoke-open-unit/sig'.
The DrScheme HelpDesk docs didn't help much, since some links were broken.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the pousse directory, adjust the link to mred and type pousse <enter>.

 Unfortunately, the pousse code contains some constructs
 particular to DrScheme v100.
 
 You can still download v100 from 
  
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/
 
 Make sure to uninstall v101 beforehand.
 
 We may be posting updated code at the ICFP site -- stay tuned.

 You might try define-values/invoke-unit/sig, 
 which was introduced (I think) in 101.
 
 The real person to ask is Matthew Flatt, mflatt@cs.utah.edu.
 He's on holiday, I think, so he may be hard to reach
 right now.
