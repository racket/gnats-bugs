>Description:
First, a brief disclaimer -- I know very little about Scheme
syntax, so please excuse any problems with the sample code in this
report.  I believe the problem itself is real.

RFC 2060 defines a number of properties for a message 
that can be retrieved with the FETCH command, such as
BODY, INTERNALDATE, FAST, etc.  The PLT imap module (imap.ss)
defines a small set of literals that can be used as arguments
to imap-get-messages.  The following is from imap-unit.ss:

      (define field-names
        (list
         (list 'uid (string->symbol "UID"))
         (list 'header (string->symbol "RFC822.HEADER"))
         (list 'body (string->symbol "RFC822.TEXT"))
         (list 'size (string->symbol "RFC822.SIZE"))
         (list 'flags (string->symbol "FLAGS"))))

While it's convenient to say something like:

  (imap-get-messages imap '(1) '(uid flags))

It's a shame that a developer cannot specify arbitrary
message properties, as in:

  (imap-get-messages imap '(1) (list string->symbol "INTERNALDATE"))

It seems that either (a) field-names should be extended to 
include all of the properties defined in RFC-2060, or (b)
it should be possible to request arbitrary properties, rather than
just those lised in field-names.

PS. The "Severity" field for bug reports includes 
"critical", "serious", and "non-critical".  Unfortunately, since
"serious" is also "non critical", this list is somewhat ambiguous.
How about "high", "medium", and "low"?

 I agree. I'm not sure that this improvement will make it into v208
 (which we're finalizing now), but it will be in the following version.
