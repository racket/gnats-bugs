>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "kathyg" by kathyg at Fri, 18 Apr 2008 08:24:02 -0400
Reason>>> A test-engine bug

State changed from "open" to "closed" by kathyg at Fri, 18 Apr 2008 08:24:02 -0400
Reason>>> Fix committed to svn; test-engine frame now checks to see if the capability is 
already registered before trying to register it.
