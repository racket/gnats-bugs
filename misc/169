 Strange. Matthias didn't have one. I thought he installed it, but maybe he
 bundled? I'll ask him to try again.

 I'm not sure what you did. Hopefully, if you get the official 49 release
 and install it using the install stript you will get the plt menu under
 your start menu. Then if you don't use the uninstaller you can keep the plt
 menu there, even if you bundle manually?

 Probably the internet explorer is more clever than netscape for
 installation stuff.
