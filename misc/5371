>Description:
The unpacking procedures in plt/collects/setup/plt-installer.ss
require MrEd.

Since setup-plt itself does not require MrEd, there should be
primitives that unpack using just MzScheme.

 It doesn't!!
 
 You just found a GUI library wrapped around Setup PLT. In other words,
 the library sets the command-line arguments and then runs Setup PLT by
 loading files from the setup.ss collection.
 
 Perhaps there should be a nicer programmatic interface for running
 setup plt yourself, but if you don't want to write one, you can just do
 what that library does, namely load and link in Setup PLT's units
 yourself.

 Yes, I was asking for that nicer programmatic interface.
