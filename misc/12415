Attempts to connect to a MySQL server fail unless the specified user is the DBA or root. That is, a user that has the necessary privileges to connect and alter a given schema doesn't seem to be allowed to connect to that scheme via Racket's db/mysql-connect.

$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.17, for osx10.6 (i386) using readline 5.1

 I haven't been able to reproduce the bug on an Ubuntu 11.10 box with 
 MySQL 5.5.18. There are some more specific notes below.

 This sequence of statements leaves me unable to log in as 'foo'. I need 
 to either change the first statement to
 
    create user 'foo'@'localhost' identified by 'foo';
 
 or execute a subsequent
 
    set password for 'foo'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('foo');
 
 Do the commands actually work as written for you, starting from a state 
 where no 'foo' user exists? (I used "drop user foo; drop user 
 'foo'@'localhost';".)
 
 > $ mysql -u foo -p
 > Enter password: foo
 
 (Fails unless a password is set for 'foo'@'localhost' specifically, as 
 described above.)

 If I don't make the change above, I don't get the internal communication 
 error, I get the expected "Access denied..." error.
 
 If I do make the change, then mysql-connect succeeds without an error.
 
 Are there any differences in your server configuration that you can 
 think of that might be relevant?

 My best guess at this point is that it has something to do with 
 authentication plugins, but I don't see why that would be happening.
 
 I've added some better debugging support to the db library; can you get 
 the latest nightly build (http://pre.racket-lang.org) and try the following:
 
 (require db/base
           db/private/mysql/main)
 
 (mysql-connect #:debug? #t
                 <your connection parameters...>)
 
 It should display the contents of the packets going to and from the 
 server. Can you send me the debugging output for the connection attempt 
 that fails?
 
 Thanks,
 Ryan

 I believe I've fixed the problem now; can you try the latest nightly 
 build at http://pre.racket-lang.org/ and see if you're able to connect? 
 Let me know if there are still problems.
 
 The problem I found and fixed affected any user with an old-style 
 password (eg "SET PASSWORD FOR user = OLD_PASSWORD(passwd)"). I think 
 there's also a global option to use old-style passwords by default; 
 perhaps that flag is set by default on some systems. Thanks for your 
 help tracking down the bug!
