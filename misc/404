>Description:
In a new educational project in the department of education in technology
and science, Technion, Israel, we chose to use DrScheme as the programming
language in functional programming course. 
The course is for high school students (grade 11). 
We would like to know if there are other users of your software 
for this (or alike) purpose, and if you develop some teaching aids
that can be useful for us.
We would like to know as well, if there is someone we can discuss
technical problems with.

with thanks,
Tammi Lapidot.
