>Description:
The errortrace profiler should record (current-gc-milliseconds) in addition to (current-process-milliseconds).  Arguably, it should subtract the former from the latter; the way I understand it, garbage collection time shouldn't be attributed to the procedure that happened to be running when it was triggered.  But perhaps there is a causality there that I don't understand.  Anyway, it would be nice to have both numbers available.  (Elapsed real time might be nice too, but is probably a lot less useful.)
