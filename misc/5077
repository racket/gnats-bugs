>Description:
I get an "send: no such method: get-values for class: check-box%" error
when trying to check "case sensitive" in the multi-file search menu.

I get an "send: no such method: set-value for class: editor-canvas%" error
when trying to report a bug using the HelpDesk, followed by a segmentation
fault.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme, open the multi-file search menu, try to check the
"case sensitive" item => error message

Start DrScheme, go the HelpDesk, click on "submit a bug report"
=> error message, click on the "ok" button => segfault

This is after doing a cvs update, make clean, make, setup-plt -c...

>Fix:
>Release-Note:
I have fixed the multi file searching problem.

In future, please use two bug reports for two bugs.
Thanks,
Robby

 Can you reproduce it? I can send your core dumps if that would help.

 Yes, but it's weird.

 The core file I have isn't useful, it seems. It looks like it is the
 same bug I was seeing earlier:

 I get a very different stack dump. There's a memory bug somewhere.

 If you get the latest exp-tagged string.c, the seg fault should go
 away.
 
 Thanks for the crashing program. It was a confusing but now-obvious
 interaction between `(system-type #t)' and exceptions (causing longjmps
 to nowhere, etc.)
