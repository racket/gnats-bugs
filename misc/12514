>Description:
I just talked to a student about frtime, and trying a few demos it was
surprising how slow they run.  To be more specific, I tried the needles
demo and it is updating at a rate of around 1 frame per second.  That's
either running in drracket or directly in racket.

I remember it being very responsive, so I used a random old installation
(v371) -- the same demo (in the frtime language level now) is as fluid as
I remember it.  So something must be wrong for such a huge slowdown...
