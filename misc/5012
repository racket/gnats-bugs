>Description:
The base documentation package located at
http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/PreRelease/DocBundles/help-doc.plt
appears to be truncated.  Installing it through help-desk or by
by hand using setup-plt results in the following message:

char->integer: expects argument of type <character>; given #<eof>
unexpected end-of-file while skipping /home/pat/plt/collects/doc/mred/keywords (at 62197 of 158264)

>How-To-Repeat:
Delete collects/doc, or start with a fresh CVS tree, run help-desk
and attempt to install the base documentation tree.

Or, download the file directly and run setup-plt help-doc.plt.
