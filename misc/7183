When opening or closing dr.scheme I recieve an error that satets:

put-preferences: some other process has the preference-file lock, as indicated by the existence of the lock file: "/Users/mbatista/Library/Preferences/.LOCK.plt-prefs.ss"

removing and reinstalling dr.scheme does not seem to have any effect, and its seems as if the .plt-prefs file is not there.

Open dr.scheme

 Did you try to remove that file and re-start DrScheme?

 If you're still getting this error it is there -- I don't know enough
 about OSX to tell you how to actually view it if it is hidden by
 default, but it's there.
 
 (Robby/Matthew: is there some way of getting this file removed without
 doing it manually?)

 I don't know of a way to do that. But, he should be able to navigate to
 the file in the Finder and drag it to the trash (the "/"s separate
 nested folders), or use the Terminal window.

 No reply so far, so I'm assuming that the problem went away, and will
 close the bug now.
