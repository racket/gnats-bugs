>Description:
positive? and negative? are not defined in beginner, intermediate, and advanced language
levels, even though zero? is.  The lack of positive? breaks at least my usual presentation
of the template for functions on natural numbers.


In general, if limitation of functions to language-levels is intentional,
I recommend documenting which language-levels each function
is available.

>How-To-Repeat:
(positive? 3)
(negative? 3)

 Ian reported the error a couple of weeks ago and it is fixed in cvs. 
 If it's important, install the cvs version via anonymous cvs.
