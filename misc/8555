>Description:
The libmzsch project is missing the reference to the Ws2_32.lib library containing getaddrinfo used by network.c.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open MzScheme solution.
2. Clean solution.
3. Right-click libmzsch and choose build.

There are unresolve garbage collector symbols (a different bug due to missing libmzgc dependency) and unresolved getaddrinfo symbols due to missing Ws2_32.lib reference.

 Does that mean that the dependency on "wsock32.lib" (in
 "AdditionalDependencies") got lost, or that "ws2_32.lib" has somehow
 become necessary?
 
 Thanks,

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 03:28:27 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew - tell me if there's anything for me to do about 
this.  (I don't have problems in the nightly builds.)


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:48:38 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
