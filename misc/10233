 I just tried to look into this, but the program you sent (when running
 in BSL + universe.ss with a build from a few hours ago) does not
 trigger the bug for me.

 Correct. It went away with an update. (I had thursday's drscheme  
 running.)
 
 BUT, now I am getting this

 AND, I am getting the names of the functions colored as if they  
 hadn't been run, even though my test cases provide complete coverage.

 I didn't fix anything, so I'm cc'ing plt-dev in case the person who
 did is there.

 How about the coverage bug (point 2, below)?

 test coverage works correctly for these three programs:
 
 (define (f x) x)
 
 ---
 
 (define (f x) x)
 (f 1)
 
 ---
 
 (define (f x) x)
 (check-expect (f 1) 1)

 Here is the smallest program for which I can get it to highlight the  
 wrong function name:
 
 ;; BSL:
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 
 (define mt (empty-scene 100 100))
 
 (check-expect
   (clack mt 3 2 "leave")
   (place-image (circle 3 "solid" "red") 3 2 mt))
 
 (define (clack ws x y action)
    (cond
      [(mouse=? "leave" action)
       (place-image (circle 3 "solid" "red") x y ws)]))
 
 ;; run program run
 (define (main s)
    (big-bang s (on-mouse clack)))

 Just to be clear for the PR transcript, the test coverage discussion
 is not really about this PR, so I've stopped CCing bugs.
