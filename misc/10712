>Description:
Hi there,

I'm using PLT-Scheme 4.2.3 and the following R6RS code:

(define test
 (lambda ()
   (let ([test-vector '#(#(#(the new) 3) #(#(of the) 2))])
   (vector-for-each
    (lambda (item)
      (display item)(newline))
    test-vector))))

(test)

Output:

#(#(the new) 3)
#(#(of the) 2)
#<void>

Independent of the type of vector etc. Where does #<void> come from? Is this a bug in the implementation of vector-for-each?

I haven't found this being mentioned elsewhere, sorry if I missed some trivial explanation or debug note on that issue.

best wishes
Damir

 this is no bug, everything work correctly, this is was a stupid side effect.
 
 Sorry for the panic!
 
 best wishes
