>Description:
vector-immutable/c produces a bad error message when given an immutable vector of the wrong length.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (define/contract v (vector-immutable/c number?) (vector-immutable 1 2))
readline-input::511-512: (definition v) broke the contract (vector-immutable/c number?) on v; expected <immutable-vector>, given: '#(1 2)

Contrast with the following good message:

> (define/contract v (list/c number?) (list 1 2))
readline-input::583-584: (definition v) broke the contract (list/c number?) on v; expected a list of 1 elements, but got 2 elements in: '(1 2)
