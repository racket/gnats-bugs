>Description:
When I tried to open DrScheme today, durring loading, I received an internal
error 
compound-unit/sig: export signature for actual userspace sub-unit is missing a value name "=", required by specified export signature for userspace
When I hit ok, to remove the internal error message, I receive another box
that says Error initializing.
When I say ok to that box, I get a window called EdJr. The DrScheme loading
Lambda window does not disappear until I close the EdJr window.

 The problem should be fixed now. (The .zo files needed to be rebuilt.)
 
 Unfortunately, this is hard to test remotely. Please let Paul or me
 know if there's still a problem.
