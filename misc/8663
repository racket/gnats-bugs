>Description:
Hello,

When entering the 'values' function into 'for-each' function, it renturns void, instead of all the values in the list that have been put iside the list entered into 'for-each'.
If it's a bug, fix it. If there's a way to override the problem, tell me. If it isn't a bug, tell me what's my problem in the programming.

Thank you,
Erez
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (add n . nums)
  (cond 
    ((empty? nums) n)
    (else (+ n (add (for-each values nums))))))

(add 1 2 3 4 5)    ==>  1

OR

(void? (for-each values '(1 2 3 4 5)))  ==> #t

 That is just the behavior of for-each. The builtin function + does
 what your add function appears to be trying to do.

 You seem to be using "for-each values" where you mean "apply".  Try
 looking up each of those three functions in DrScheme's Help Desk.
