 Thanks for the bug report!
 
 For what it's worth, we'll probably have a completely different
 integration of drscheme and the test suite window for the next release
 -- we plan to have them all together in the single window and are
 experimenting with the best way to do that integration.
 
 But do keep the bug reports coming!
 
 Best,
 Robby
