>Description:
To build 299.100 on Linux, I used the conventional "./configure --prefix=/usr/local".  This resulted in files and directories like "collects" and "install" being put immediately under "/usr/local" when the build was installed.

I noticed after the fact that the "src/README" file gives "--prefix=/usr/local/plt" as an example.

Actually, I think that neither case confirms with the Unix common filesytem hierarchy standards of the last few years.

Ideally, PLT's "configure --prefix" would have the same meaning as it does in most other packages nowadays.  All files would be installed somewhere under standard subdirectories of the prefix directory, such as "bin", "include", "lib", and "man".  One guide for the current conventions is:

 I've been thinking about this for a while, too. I think it will be
 easier to work on after we switch from CVS to Subversion.

 Is there anything that should be moved in the repository?

 Mainly, I think "collects" should become "lib/plt/collects". That will
 be less painful to try with Subversion, right?

 Yes -- but do you really want to complicate the tree structure just to
 make it easier to do an install?  Since this is only an issue for
 Unix, then wouldn't it be fine to simply rename the collects when
 installing or put some symlinks?
 
 It will address the main problem that stands in the way of including
 plt with standard distributions, but that's only a matter of what
 `make install' does, not the actual source tree structure...

 It's a matter of default search paths, etc., so I don't think it's so
 easy to make the distinction. In any case, using SVN, we can try things
 and discuss this further without committing too early to a particular
 solution.

 Well, before that I was hoping to get some chance to see if the make
 install part can be tweaked to do something more unixly-correct.  That
 will make a better solution, IMO, than changing the PLT tree for the
 same outcome.
