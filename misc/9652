>Description:
Material:	Guide: PLT Scheme

Location:	3.9 Vectors
Text:		When allocating extra lists seems too expensive, use consider using 
			looping forms like fold-for, which recognize vectors as well 
			as lists.
Note:		"use consider using" doesn't need "use"


Location:	4.4.3 Declaring Keyword Arguments
Text:		In the syntax documentation for declaring keyword arguments
Note:		The definition for "gen-formals" is missing.


Location:	4.7 Conditionals
Text:		We we say a true value to mean any value other than #f.
Note:		Duplicate "we".


Location:	4.7.1 Simple Branching: if
Text:		An if form must have both an then-expr and an else-expr;
Note:		Should be "a", not "an".
Correction:	Replace "an" with "a".

Location:	4.10 Quoting: quote and â€™
Text:		An expression '_datum is a shorthand for (quote datum)
Note:		The underscore before datum seems unnecessary.

Location:	10.2 Prompts and Aborts
Text:		When an exception is raised control, 
			escapes out of an arbitrary deep
Note:		There should be an "it" before "escapes"

Location:	14.6 unit versus module
Text:		The module form is more fundamental that the others
Note:		"that" should be "than"

Location:	15.2.1 Creating and Installing Namespaces
Text:		Attaching a module adjust the mapping of module names 
Note:		Should be "adjusts".

Location:	16.1.7 Extended Example: Call-by-Reference Functions
Text:		We can use pattern-matching macros to implement add a form 
Note:		"implement" should be deleted

 I've fixed all as you said, except for this:

 I just moved the comma: ... is raised, control escapes ...
