>Description:
Given the following erroneous types of unit definitions:

    (unit)
    (unit (export) (import))
    (unit (import))
    (unit (export))

the implementation of unit.ss displays syntax error messages that aren't as descriptive as they can be.  Here is a proposed set of additional syntax patterns that should catch these kinds of mistakes and report a more specific syntax error:

Reason>>> Scott -- looks like you're in the best position for
dealing with this (or knowing if it's worth dealing
with.)

Reason>>> Units.  I'm working on a new unit system, but if this bug is to be worked on for 
v300, I'm not the guy.
