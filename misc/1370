>Description:
I downloaded the most recent source distribution and 
compiled on a Solaris machine.  When I run mzscheme, it
segfaults on bad inputs.  I tried to run gdb on it, but then
it segfaults just on initialization.  I tried setting PLTHOME
to point to my tree, in case it was finding an incompatible
PLT tree, but that didn't help either.  When compiling, I didn't
specify any extra flags.  The compiler is egcs-1.1.2, OS is
Solaris 2.6.

 The last time I tired ecgs under Solaris (well before gcc 2.95), it
 produced incorrect code for MzScheme. I don't remember exactly what was
 wrong, but I simply went back to old gcc.
 
 Is using a different version of the compiler an option?

 I tried with gcc 2.95 and it works fine.  It's no problem for me to
 switch...  Thanks-

 JFYI:
 
 Compiling with gcc 2.95.2 didn't work for me.
 
 I found the problem: a missing `volatile' in the MzScheme source, which
 caused a crash in `dynamic-wind' handling.
 
 Probably that was the problem before, when I tried an earlier egcs on
 sparc. The bug wouldn't show up for x86, since it has so few registers.
 
 Fixed for future releases.
