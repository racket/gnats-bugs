>Description:
Font sizes and attributes change randomly when scrolling in DrScheme windows (Helpdesk, definitions and interactions window). Sometimes while scrolling in a helpdesk document text in the interactions window changes size, is displayed underlined or in a different font.
When scrolling text to the top of a window it is often displayed underlined.

>How-To-Repeat:
Just started DrScheme, it happens always.
I have screenshots if this helps.

Thanks,
Thomas
