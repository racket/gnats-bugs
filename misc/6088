>Description:
On lines 75-76 of collects/setup/winvers.ss the extensions for the last two file names I think should be ".lib" and not ".dll", otherwise these files are skipped and not patched, allowing link to lib but preventing the
program from running because the dll it's looking for does not exist.

But the regex (line 62) used to match instances of the dll name in those files is too restrictive - there are instances where the symbol
"libmzschxxxxxxx" appears in the .lib files without the ".dll" suffix - and these would be skipped and cause linker errors (for me, anyway). Changing the regex to "xxxxxxx" fixed it but that may be too delicate.

obviously this is only if you have run the version frobber program and
not kept the xxxxxxx dll filenames.

>How-To-Repeat:
unpack mzscheme 203 source and follow directions in src/worksp/README (using msvc), then compile and link a program that embeds mzscheme (I was using the test program for an opengl binding - GLSCM on your 3rd party page). Program should not run, complaining it can't find the dll (because it is looking for the xxxxxxx name.)
