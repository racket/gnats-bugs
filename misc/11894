>Description:
The example for check-exn says:

---
For example, the following check succeeds:

(check-exn exn:fail?
           (lambda ()
             (raise (make-exn "Hi there"
                              (current-continuation-marks)))))
---

It does not, because an exn is not necessarily an exn:fail.  This can be corrected with:


(check-exn exn:fail?
           (lambda ()
             (raise (make-exn:fail "Hi there"
                                   (current-continuation-marks)))))
