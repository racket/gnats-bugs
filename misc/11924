I pressed Alt+F2, and in the "Run Application" box that appeared, typed "plt-games" into the text box.  That brought up a little window with lots of icons representing various games.  I clicked on the one labled "Paint By Numbers", and saw an error popup with the above text.

 This is the only call to min-height I see in the paint by numbers source:
 
           (min-height (inexact->exact (round (+ col-label-height (*
 grid-y-size row-label-height)))))
 
 and I don't see anything obviously wrong with the error checking code
 (and it doesn't happen on my machine yet) so I'm a bit stuck.

 This should be fixed if you try the latest pre-release build. I
 committed a fix a bit ago. Thanks for the report.

 Thanks!
 
 One question: should it be ceiling, instead of round?
