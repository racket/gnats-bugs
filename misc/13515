mac-i386-osx
>Description:
The behavior of ,enter has changed (I think starting circa 5.3.1). It won't re-load the file, when enter! would do so.

In the steps below I use 5.3.1, but the behavior is identical with the latest version as of this bug report: 5.3.3.1 built from HEAD as of Sun Feb 10.
>How-To-Repeat:
First let's try `enter!`:

    $ /Applications/Racket_v5.3.1/bin/racket
    Welcome to Racket v5.3.1.
    -> ,cd /tmp
    ; now in /tmp
    -> ,sh
    echo '#lang racket' > x.rkt
    echo '"hi"' >> x.rkt
    exit
    (require racket/enter)
    -> (enter! "x.rkt")
    "hi"
    "x.rkt"> (enter! "x.rkt")  ;does nothing. OK fine.
    "x.rkt"> ,sh
    echo '"there"' >> x.rkt
    exit
    (enter! "x.rkt")           ;re-loads changed file. Yay!
      [re-loading /tmp/x.rkt]
    "hi"
    "there"
    "x.rkt"> (exit)

Notice that after x.rkt is changed, `enter!` _does_ re-load and
re-evaluate the file and display "hi\nthere".

But next let's try using `,enter`:

    $ /Applications/Racket_v5.3.1/bin/racket
    Welcome to Racket v5.3.1.
    -> ,cd /tmp
    ; now in /tmp
    -> ,sh
    echo '#lang racket' > x.rkt
    echo '"hi"' >> x.rkt
    exit
    ,enter x.rkt
    "hi"
    "x.rkt"> ,enter x.rkt     ;does nothing. OK fine.
    "x.rkt"> ,sh
    echo '"there"' >> x.rkt
    exit
    ,enter x.rkt              ;still does nothing. Boo!
    "x.rkt"> (exit)

Notice that after x.rkt is changed, `,enter` does _not_ re-load and
re-evaluate th fiel and display "hi\nthere". Why not? Shouldn't it?
