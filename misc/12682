>Description:
When there's only one frame in the debugger backtrace, the multi-stop-sign button should be hidden.

For example, this program:

#lang racket
(require rackunit)
(check-equal? 1 2)

produces an error message with a stop sign button (which is awesome -- when did that start happening?).  However, the multi-stop-sign button doesn't provide any extra info -- just two copies of the same stack location.

In this case, I think DrRacket should just show the single stop sign.

 I'm not sure how that is coming out, but I think the fix is to supply
 a list that doesn't have the duplicate element in it (presumably by
 not duplicating something somewhere else).
 
 In other words, I'm not seeig how this is a drracket pr. If someone
 from the rackunit side can clarify, tho, I'm happy to look into it
 more.

 Rackunit is just calling
 
    ((error-display-handler) (exn-message exn) exn)
 
 so the duplication of frames is happening elsewhere.
 
 Here's as simplification that eliminates rackunit. Put the following 
 program in the definitions window
 
    #lang racket
    (error "bad")
 
 and then click Run, then click on the backtrace icon (multi-stop-sign) 
 that appears in the interaction window. The backtrace consists of two 
 identical frames.
 
 I'm bouncing this back to Robby, but it might be an errortrace bug, in 
 which case he can reassign it to Matthew, if necessary.

 Thanks. It looks like this is because the source location for the
 wrapper inserted by the #%module-begin for printing values is the same
 as the original thing, ie with the code above in ~/tmp.rkt:
 
 $ racket -l errortrace -t ~/tmp.rkt
 bad
   errortrace...:
    /Users/robby/tmp.rkt:2:0: (error (quote "bad"))
    /Users/robby/tmp.rkt:2:0: (call-with-values (lambda () (error
 (quote "bad"))) print-values)
   context...:
    /Users/robby/tmp.rkt: [running body]
 
 
 so I think probably the right thing is for the DrRacket exception
 handler printing code to skip multiple identical frames (same source
 locations that is).

 Oh, except that sometimes you want to be aware of duplicate frames, eg
 as in this program:
 
 #lang racket
 (define (f x)
   (if (begin (set! a (- a 1)) (zero? a))
       #f
       (+ 1 (f x))))
 
 (define a 100)
 (+ (f 10) 1)
