>Description:
Regardless of if it's legal or not some people (including an
unnamed professor at rice outside of PLT) put : characters in
the fragment names.  combine-url/relative doesn't like this.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (require-library "url.ss" "net")
> (print-struct #t)
> (combine-url/relative (string->url "http://www/") "#hi")
#(struct:url "http" "www" #f "/" #f #f "hi")
> (combine-url/relative (string->url "http://www/") "#hi:there")
sbustring: second index 0 out of range [4,9] for string: "#hi:there"
> (string->url "http://www/#hi:there")
#(struct:url "http" "www" #f "/" #f #f "hi:there")

State-Changed-Why:
The substring error should definitely not take place.  I have added a
fix for that.  The URL package now reports that you have illegal
(unquoted) characters in your path.  I think that's the best I can do
for now.  Since I have tried to create a reference implementation, I
don't think it's right to add odd special case rules to handle things
that people do.  (Who is this person anyway?)

Please comment if you are unhappy with this.  Otherwise I will close
the problem.
