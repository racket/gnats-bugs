>Description:
The documentation for the triangle/ass function in 2htdp/image states that the first argument to the function is an angle.  This example from the documentation seems to contradict that statement, as it produces an obtuse (not right) triangle:
(triangle/ass 90  60 100 "solid" "aquamarine") 

Also, the documentation does not address how the function disambiguates and chooses one of the two triangles possible given an angle and two sides that are not both adjacent to that angle.

 There was a bug in triangle/ass that resulted in the wrong picture
 being generated. This bug has been fixed

 Try scrolling up to the beginning of the triangle section.
 
 Suggestions for improvements welcome.

 Ah!  So triangle/ass is actually a construction using the geometric SAS
 theorem (i.e., the angle to be given is the included angle of the given sides)
 to determine the triangle.  This differs from the standard nomenclature in
 HS geometry curricula (though I probably wouldn't know that if I weren't
 teaching HS geometry, myself).
 
 In that case, I think it would suffice to modify this paragraph:
 
      To create a general triangle given known sides and angles the following
      family of functions are useful: triangle/sss, triangle/ass, triangle/sas,
      triangle/ssa, triangle/sss, triangle/sss, and, triangle/sss.
 
 (which, by the way, has typos on the last three function names) to something
 like:
 
      To create a general triangle given known sides and angles the following
      family of functions are useful:
 
          * triangle/sss, if all three sides are known
          * triangle/ass, triangle/sas, or triangle/ssa, if two sides and their
            included angle are known
          * triangle/aas, triangle/asa, or triangle/saa, if two angles and their
            shared side are known.

 Thanks! That's much better.
