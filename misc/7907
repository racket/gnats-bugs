>Description:
The order of the buttons in the Bug Report Form is "Show Synthesized Info" "Submit" "Cancel". It should be "Show Synthesized Info" "Cancel" "Submit".
The general spacing in the dialog is also wrong, but not as serious since it doesn't have an impact on how easy it is to make mistakes

 This PR says:
 
   The order of the buttons in the Bug Report Form is "Show Synthesized
   Info" "Submit" "Cancel". It should be "Show Synthesized Info"
   "Cancel" "Submit".
   The general spacing in the dialog is also wrong, but not as serious
   since it doesn't have an impact on how easy it is to make mistakes
 
 Are there any obections to swapping the submit and cancel buttons?
 
 Also, I guess that the spacing issue refers to a stretchable
 horizontal space between the show-synthesized-info button and the
 others.  I can do both changes now.

 Swapping them would be great. Cancel should come to the left.

 That's fine with me.
 
 Thanks!

 OK, so there is now:
 
    [show-synth-info]   ....horizontal-space....     [Cancel] [Submit]
 
 and I closed the PR.
