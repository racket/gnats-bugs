>Description:
Currently:

(check-within expr expr expr)

Like check-expect, but with an extra expression that produces a number delta. The test case checks that each number in the result of the first expr is within delta of each corresponding number from the second expr.

should this be:

(check-within expr expr delta)

or

Like check-expect, but with a _third_ expression that produces a number delta. The test case checks that each number in the result of the first expr is within delta of each corresponding number from the second expr.
