>Description:
From the description, I believe that 

(require (lib "match"))
(match-lambda ((a ?) #f))

is bad syntax for a match (the ? needs an argument),
but rather than give an error the match compiler
loops forever.  The same is true of the simpler
but closer-to-correct

(require (lib "match"))
(match-lambda ((?) #f))
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start mzscheme.
2. Type either of the two-line sequences in the description.

>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Fri, 06 Jul 2007 22:53:03 -0400
Reason>>> match


State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Tue, 01 Apr 2008 09:55:15 -0400
Reason>>> fixed by new implementation
