 Is it possible you were editing a file that had about 240 (or 260)
 characters in it, total?

 No worries! I don't have any ideas, but I'll let the people who wrote  
 the debug button know.
 
 Thanks,

 This does look like a bug I've seen before in the debugger.  However,
 I too was unable to reproduce the error with the input program he
 provided.  For one thing, the PR says he was in "Intermediate Student
 with lambda", which shouldn't even display the debug button.  But I
 tried in PLT Pretty Big and couldn't get it to happen there either.
 Let me know if there are any more such reports, and I'll look into it
 further when I can.
 
 Thanks,
 Greg

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gcooper" by eli at Tue, 17 Oct 2006 00:11:58 -0400
Reason>>> debugger (I think)


State changed from "open" to "feedback" by gcooper at Tue, 12 Dec 2006 01:27:54 -0500
Reason>>> added a check so this shouldn't happen anymore


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 14:52:59 -0500
Reason>>> probably fixed
