>Description:
The program below produces 'bad, but I think it should produce
'good

(require (lib "plt-match.ss"))

(match '(sum-of 1)
  [`(sum-of ,@(xs ...)) 'good]
  [_ 'bad])
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
Either of the following programs produce 'good:

(require (lib "match.ss"))

(match '(sum-of 1)
  [`(sum-of ,@(xs ...)) 'good]
  [_ 'bad])

or

(require (lib "plt-match.ss"))

(match '(sum-of 1)
  [`(sum-of ,@(list xs ...)) 'good]
  [_ 'bad])

The original program should possibly be an error, but I'm not sure.

 What's wrong?
 
 (CCing bugs, to see if it will work.)

 I got an error saying RCPT TO: bugs@ccs.neu.edu didn't work.  But I
 guess it's working now.
