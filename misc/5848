>Description:
After installing PLT on Mac OS X 10.2 I tried to install the optional manuals from the Help Desk menu.  Installation failed because the files in the PLT v202 installed directory are writable only by root:

/Applications/PLT v202/collects/doc/tools
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  21740 Sep 24 17:17 hdindex
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  64487 Sep 24 17:17 keywords

I operate with a separate user account but even logging in as the administrative account for the machine did not allow a successful installation.

I was able to do the installation by logging in as root (because I have enabled root logins on my machine, not a standard Mac OS X configuration).

The file protection is the right thing to do, but there needs to be an installer or 'sudo' procedure to avoid having to be root to do updates.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install PLT on Mac OS X
go to help desk, click on manuals, click on any optional documentation at the bottom of the list of manuals, ask to download and install the manual.

 Thanks for this report, too. We're working on a solution to this
 problem, though we don't have one yet.
