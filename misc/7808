>Description:
version 300 is the first I ever installed (downloaded today).  I have a december build of wxwidgets installed prior to drscheme.

Some issues I have:

All of the FRtime demos cause drscheme to go into an infinite loop when attempted to run or syntax check. (Yes I have set language to FRTime when running those)

while the plot demos will print in the REPL space no other graphical programs will display a window.  

No errors occur in the demos.  I can compile them.  But no window is ever shown.  The one exception is the graphing teachpack example.  It will display if I add the teachpack for the program.

Making best guesses for gui related teachpacks (or adding virtually all of them) still has not resulted in visible windows spawning from other demo programs.

While on the teachpack subject, a great way to design it would be for any program that uses one to have a 

(Define (*TEACHPACKS* htdp\mypack htdp\master ...) 

at/near the top of any program that uses teachpacks and have the editor interact with such a definition.  This would provide the best of both worlds -- packaging module requirements without having to understand the process, and keeping content distributable.
>How-To-Repeat:
Will be happy to provide additional info or try suggestions.

The language settings most typically attempted with these demos was "Pretty big"

 I typed in a three line test program for world.ss, one of the 
 teachpacks:
 
 (big-bang 100 100 .1 0)
 (on-tick-event add1)
 (on-redraw (lambda (x) (circle x 'solid 'red)))
 
 Hitting RUN brings up a window with a growing red ball. Is it this what 
 you mean with graphical program?
 
 Your suggestion for teachpacks/editors has been in the works for a 
 while; wait for v302.
