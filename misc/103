A couple of the tables are misplaced in the PLT DrScheme: Programming 
Environment Manual (internal web pages via eri).  In the section on
"Scheme Language Modifications", The "Language Levels" table is in the 
"Read-Eval-Print Loop" page, and the "printer table" (should be in repl)
is actually in "Position Operations" in Graphics.
