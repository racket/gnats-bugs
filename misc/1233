Our classes nil symbol stands for '( ), which Dr. S won't agree to.  Worse, Dr. S only permits lambda to be used within a definition.  E.g. map lambda... '(1 23 ) won't work.  Also, lambdas without arguments are forbidden.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define nil '() )

(map (lambda (x) (* x x)) '(1 2 3))

        Our classes nil symbol stands for '( ), which Dr. S won't agree to.
        Worse, Dr. S only permits lambda to be used within a definition.  
        E.g. map lambda... '(1 23 ) won't work.  Also, lambdas without 
        arguments are forbidden.
 
 Some syntactic features of Scheme are prohibited at various 
 "language levels".  Probably you're using the "Beginner" level.
 
 From the menus, pick Language | Configure Language to use 
 a higher level, and you'll be able to write the constructs 
 you indicate.
