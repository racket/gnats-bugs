 I don't see how this problem can happen -- did you install the PLAI
 package after installing 4.0.2.5 or before?
 
 If after, then perhaps plai.plt contains .zo files which would be the
 problem?
 
 If it's before then it's very weird because you wouldn't have a
 directory called ...\PLT Scheme\4.0.2.5, so I don't know what could
 the problem be.
