>Description:
A failing 'check-within' test in a module-language use of scheme-tests apparently uses the 'within' number as a format string:

=> 
format: expects argument of type <format-string>; given 1
>How-To-Repeat:
evaluate this program in the module language:

#lang scheme

(require test-engine/scheme-tests)

(check-within 1 3 1) 

(test)
