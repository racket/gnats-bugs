>Description:
Just look at this screenshot taken on a wide screen monitor:

   http://i.imgur.com/7qjuW.png

Apparently this stems from absolute widths given in "ems" in the file "scribble.css". Changing the widths to percentages seems to help on Firefox, but every time I run Scribble it'll create a new scribble.css.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type something long into one Scribble paragraph with #lang scribble/manual. Render it as HTML:

   scribble --html foobar.scrbl

Then view it in a browser. Widen the browser if the problem isn't immediately obvious.

 Scribble is producing output that should render as readable text, and
 using some given width (in `em' units) is extremely common.  Try
 almost any random source of text (like cnn.com or nytimes.com) and
 you'll see the same -- and that makes sense, since if the text was
 allowed to span the entire width of your wide window, it would make it
 hard to read, resulting in resizing the window to be able to do that.
