>Description:
In the documentation for syntax-parse, 
http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Parsing_syntax.html
could a link be made somehow for the 'pattern-directory' non-terminal to it's production rule which is given in 8.4.1 (http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/stxparse-specifying.html) but is hard to find (doesn't turn up in the search either, unless you search for just 'pattern' by chance and happen to scroll through that section)?
