Linux
>Description:
The "plt/bin/archsys" contains the following lines for Intel Linux:

     if [ `file /bin/ls | grep ELF | wc -l` = 1 ]; then
        SYS=i386${SEP}linux
      else
        SYS=i386${SEP}linux${SEP}aout
     fi

That is, ELF support is detected by checking whether the "ls" binary is
ELF; otherwise the old a.out executable format is assumed.

I think this is wrong on two counts:

(1) You don't supply Linux a.out executables. (I don't know if they could
be built by compiling the sources, though.)

(2) On systems such as mine supporting both formats "ls" might be a.out
and the resulting value of SYS would then be wrong. In fact, my guess is
that is such systems "ls" is a _prime_candidate_ for being a.out, because
it was present already when the kernel only supported a.out and might
not have been updated to ELF when upgrading the kernel... =8^)

A fine-tuning sledgehammer solution is simply to comment out everything
except the first assignment to SYS. This is also a correct general solution
if you don't support a.out at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to install the Linux ELF version on any system with "ls" in a.out
format. The command "./install" will fail to find the incorrectly
determined and nonexistent directory "plt/.bin/i386-linux-aout/" instead of
the correct and existing "plt/.bin/i386-linux/".

 We used to, and they can still be built from source. I'd much rather
 keep the test if it generally works.

 I'm no Linux expert, and I forget who recommended the above test, but
 it has apparently worked well for others in practice. Nevertheless,
 I'd be delighted if you can suggest a more precise test.
 
 Thanks,

 I am not a Linux expert either, but I  guess testing for the existence
 of the dynamic loading  library "libdl.so" itself (or other components
 of the ELF support) would  be a good  start. In fact, "libdl.so" might
 be required already for loading compiled code into DrScheme.
