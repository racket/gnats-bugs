>Description:
Using tex2page if the \hyperlink{x}{y} directive is used a link is formed by prepending two #'s to the text. In tex2page/tex2page-aux.ss the 'and' part of fully-qualifed-url should read

  ((and (> n 0) (not (char=? (string-ref url 0) #\#)))

instead of

  ((and (> n 0) (char=? (string-ref url 0) #\#))
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following in a tex file
\hyperlink{foo}{bar}
\hypertarget{foo}{bar}

Then run tex2page on it and view the document in a browser.

Subject: Re: [plt-bug] all/8443: tex2page: hyperlink adds an extra #
Date: Sat, 23 Dec 2006 12:06:14 -0500

 the solution I posted for this isn't right I think. The real problem is 
 maybe-lable-page adds a # if the page count is equal to the current page 
 and then fully-qualify-url adds another # to deal with anchors. There 
 are numerous ways to fix this, all of which are sort of hacks so I am 
 hesitant to suggest anything. For now I just removed the # in 
 fully-qualify-url, but I think that will break references to other 
 pages. The best hack is probably to remove the # from maybe-label-url 
 and then fix do-htmlpageref to handle # itself.
