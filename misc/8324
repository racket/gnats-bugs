>Description:
The handin server does not attach the module that defines cached-image-snip% into the evaluation namespace for user submissions. Thus the cached-image-snip instances are not considered images in the user's program.

Does anyone else know of any other kinds of snip-values that might suffer from this problem?
>How-To-Repeat:
Submit the following homework to the handin server. Make sure to enable server-side evaluation and use one of the teaching languages.

(if (not (image? <<<LITERAL IMAGE>>>))
    (error 'problem "not an image")
    'okay)

This program evaluates cleanly to 'okay in DrScheme. It raises an error in the handin server.
