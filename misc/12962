>Description:
with xrepl, (terminal-port? (current-input-port)) is #f when readline is installed and using the command ,edit with EDITOR set to vim does not function properly. Any editor that requires an actual terminal port will also likely have a problem. I'm reporting this from my OS X box, but this problem exists on Ubuntu as well. It also exists for the ,shell command and aliases as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
System with readline. Start xrepl with readline support. Use ,edit or ,shell with program that requires (terminal-port? (current-input-port)) to be true (e.g. vim).
