>Description:
Methods seem to be missing in the Insert Java Class and Insert
Java Union menus.  To wit:

1) the "add method template" checkbox seems to have no effect; 
  whether or not it is on, no method template appears.

2) Methods added to a union in the Insert Java Union are not
  added to the class
>How-To-Repeat:
In ProfJ:intermediate (though I believe this holds for Beginner
as well):
1) Choose Insert Java Union
2) Fill in bogus values, including one method
3) Click okay.

If these instructions are not detailed enough, I'd be glad to 
provide better ones.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "matthias" by matthias at Sun, 28 Jan 2007 18:50:00 -0500
Reason>>> mine


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by matthias at Mon, 30 Apr 2007 13:11:19 -0400
Reason>>> I had disabled this menu item and apparently nobody used them for quite
a while. (I'll try to fix it for the next release.)


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by matthias at Mon, 30 Apr 2007 20:24:28 -0400
Reason>>> I have removed the method template checkboxes :-)
