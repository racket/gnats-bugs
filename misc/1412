>Description:
net collection doesn't say what the syntax for file: urls
that it uses is.

In particular, it must say what the syntax is for accessing the various
drives under windows (or give a pointer to the correct spot in 
the mzscheme manual.

 Also, under Windows, if you run
 
       (string->url "C:\\foo.html")
 
 then the scheme becomes "C", which is probably
 unintended.  Probably the scheme should be "file://" or #f, 
 with the drive letter retained in the path.
 
 While we're on the topic, it would be very useful to have a procedure
 
    normalize-url : struct:url -> struct:url
 
 so that
 
    (equal? (normalize-url (string->url "www.rice.edu"))
            (normalize-url (string->url "http://www.rice.edu/"))
    -> #t	   
 
 In particular, that would help our link checker.

 Except that would be wrong.  The latter is an absolute URL with scheme
 "http" and host "www.rice.edu".  The former is a relative URL that
 seems to indicate the relative path named "www.rice.edu".
 
 To normalize absolute+relative paths, you can already use
 combine-url/relative, which returns a URL that you can then compare
 using your favorite predicate.

 I'll see whether that procedure is sufficient.
 
 The docs are unclear what the procedure does.  
 There is one mention of it in the Examples section:
 
   (define comb combine-url/relative)
 
 and this definition is never used!

 Combination is well-defined in the standard, so I saw no need to
 repeat that documentation.

 Except that there's no reference to the standard (or to those for the 
 POP3, IMAP4, DNS, etc.) in the documentation.  There should at least be 
 pointers to the relevant documents, if users need to rely on them
 to use the collection effectively.
