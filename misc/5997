The tester respects the language level for execution, but not for printing.

Select Beginner Scheme.
Type (list 1 2 3) in the Call box.
The Actual box prints
(1 2 3)
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
One error does still remain. The coloring of the actual textbox becomes very odd when the text box is large and only half in view.

 The stepper tackles this problem, but "solves" it in an ugly, gross 
 way.  If you (Mike) do any work on this problem, please let me know.  
 Alternatively, if you want to see an ugly, gross  solution to the 
 problem, by all means inspect stepper-tool.ss and model-settings.ss.
