>Description:
I just installed v202 on a recent RedHat 7.3 installation.

A few minutes later, I logged in as root, and saw I had 
two new mail messages. Some demon sent me mail about 
bad drscheme-jr man pages.  WTH, I thought!

Sure enough, there is a symlink in /usr/local/man/man1 to
the DrJr man page, which doesn't exist.

I'm not sure which program put it there -- the RPM script?
>How-To-Repeat:
Install v202 on Linux using the RPM.
>Fix:
I removed the drscheme-jr link from the RPM script
