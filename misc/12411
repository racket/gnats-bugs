Lexical context wrong for litsets with marks.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require syntax/parse
         syntax/parse/experimental/reflect)

(define-syntax-rule (literal-syntax-class literal)
  (let ()
    (define-literal-set set (literal))
    (define-syntax-class class
      #:literal-sets (set)
      [pattern (~and (~do (eprintf "Match? ~a\n" 'literal))
                     literal
                     (~do (eprintf "Matched ~a\n" 'literal)))])
    (reify-syntax-class class))) 

(define r1 (literal-syntax-class define))
(syntax-parse #'define [(~reflect x (r1)) 'ok]) ;; okay
(syntax-parse #'lambda [(~reflect x (r1)) 'ok]) ;; should fail, but doesn't!

Still fails with explicit #:at here added.

Analogous program with #:literals instead of aux litset works correctly (raises error on second example).
