>Description:
Table 2 in the documentation for SRFI 19 shows a list of escapes that can be used in
template strings in the string->date procedure. The table is missing a ~N switch for
parsing nanosecond components.

 Yes, that makes sense.

 No, I don't believe there is... yes, I see, that's really quite  
 shocking: there's no good place to put that documentation.  My only  
 suggestion to you is that since we maintain our own copy of the SRFI  
 documentation, that we can certainly stick extra things in there.   
 Perhaps this is already done, for other SRFIs?  I don't really know.
 
 Does Francisco Solsona still maintain the SRFI libraries?
