 This sounds like a contracts-related problem.  Maybe it would justify
 a patch?

 Has it shown up elsewhere? If so yes.

 I don't know.  My guess is based on the `lifted' occurrence.

 I guess that much, too.

 Ok, I finally get it...
 
 An important extra fact for this bug report is that the program has to
 be run twice, and not in a module. (PR 9151 helped clear that up.)
 
 The problem is a combination of (1) the top level, (2) the fact that
 the contract library is shared between DrScheme and the user's program,
 and therefore across user programs, and (3) the contract library caches
 contract instantiations, distinguishing different contexts through
 `syntax-local-lift-context' --- which doesn't distinguish among
 top-level environments for different namespaces.
 
 The bug is difficult for us to detect, since we avoid non-module
 programming.
 
 I think the solution is to have `syntax-local-lift-context' return a
 specific value for the top-level environment, and the contract library
 will have to treat the top-level environment as uncacheable. Currently,
 the value turns out to be #t or #f for a top-level context. I'll change
 v3.99 to consistently produce #f.
 
 Meanwhile, I've changed the contract implementation in the v3 branch to
 treat a boolean as an indicator for the top-level environment, and to
 not cache any contract ids in that case.
