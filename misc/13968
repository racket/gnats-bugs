>Description:
The typed-in require for plai-typed/untyped fails on subforms when the same typed-in require succeeds for plai-typed.

(Which makes it more difficult to, e.g., use plai-typed/untyped to run tests prior to reaching type safety.)
>How-To-Repeat:
The following works correctly:

#lang plai-typed

(module foo racket
  (provide bar)
  (define (bar x) (add1 x)))

(require (typed-in 'foo [bar : (number -> number)]))




However, changing the #lang to plai-typed/untyped fails with: "quote: not a required sub-form in: (quote foo)".

 I'm not yet sure whether the problem is in `typed-in' from
 `plai-typed/untyped' or a limitation of `require' from `racket', but
 you could work around the problem by using the long form of submodule
 reference:
 
    (require (typed-in (submod "." foo) [bar : (number -> number)]))
