>Description:
In the plai-typed documentation, the values form does not indicate that it produces a tuple, which makes it hard to find how to produce a tuple when searching the documentation.

Current text: Combines multiple values into one; the type of each elem is independent. Match a values result using define-values.

Suggested text: Combines multiple values into one tuple; the type of each elem is independent. Match a values result using define-values.
