>Description:
I did not experience this errror from within DrScheme but am only reporting it here. Rather, I was playing Spider using the compiled application (MrEd) included with 301.14 and got an error while moving a column. It may be a coincidence, but I don't think I've seen this error prior to 301.14.

vector-ref: expects type <non-negative exact integer> as 2nd argument, given: #f; other arguments were: #10((#<struct:object:card%> #<struct:object:card%> #<struct:object:card%> #<struct:object:card%> ...

>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure. I was playing Spider from the icon (I don't know how to launch it from DrScheme) and got an error while moving a column.

 I tried playing a little in v300, and did get the same error.  I
 couldn't reliably re-create it, but here are a few possible problems:
 
 1. When clicking a source pile and the a target pile, the source pile
    is slowly flying towards the target.  While this is happenning, it
    is possible to start dragging the target pile elsewhere.  Sometime
    it works to drag it, and sometime it doesn't but once the flying
    deck arrives it is possible to drag the card underneat
    independently.  In any case it is clear that some assumptions are
    violated.
 
 2. After playing some more, I got one
      car: expects argument of type <pair>; given ()
    error.
 
 3. Shortly after the above, clicking the face-down deck would not deal
    new cards.  Instead, I got this error:
      procedure ...spider/spider.ss:406:30: expects no arguments, given 1: ()
    (The svn version has the same code at that point.)

Reason>>> cards

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Mon, 22 May 2006 17:06:11 -0400
Reason>>> Thanks for the PR and extra information.

I think I've fixed the 2 bugs that caused the problems.
One was a bug in Spider, and the other was a bug in the
card library. I think the latter explains how my son
used to get Go Fish into a strange state (and I could
never recreate the problem).

The card library is extremely subtle, because there are
too many layers of state. So watch out for new problems
due to my repairs. I'll keep the PR open until we've
all played a few rounds. :)

Reason>>> Seems to be fixed.
