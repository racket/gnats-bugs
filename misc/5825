>Description:
I think check syntax does too much checking.
When changing "require" according to SLIB
syntax highlightning does not work anymore.
This is extremly odd, given that SLIB is somewhat of
a standard library for cross implementation scheme code.

Regards
Ulf
>How-To-Repeat:
;; Put the following in the file

; We need SLIB
(require (lib "load.ss" "slibinit"))

; From SLIB we want
(require 'format)

;; Now press "Check Syntax" button.
;; DrScheme will complain about wrong require syntax
;; and do no syntax highlightning.

 This appears to be something not check syntax-specific.
 
 This also fails when executing:
 
   (module m mzscheme
     (require (lib "load.ss" "slibinit"))
     (require 'format))
 
 In the original problem, slib appears to be re-binding `require' but
 check syntax doesn't pick that up, even tho it is calling
 eval-compile-time-part-of-top-level.

 Executing the "load.ss" module performs a `load' (yes, a plain old
 `load') on "init.ss" in "slibinit". So the module below is indeed
 ill-formed.
 
 I don't imagine that Check Syntax can work when the meaning of an
 expression depends on the run-time effect of previous expression. It's
 simply the broekn-top-level problem.

 Is there anything we can do to help the original poster? He'd like to
 syntax check his slib-using programs.
 
 Maybe one option is to consider supporting something like this:
 
   (module m (lib "slib-lang.ss" "slibinit")
     (require 'display))
 
 in the future?
 
 (Do we maintain slibinit?)
