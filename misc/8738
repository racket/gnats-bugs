>Description:
Attempting to export via provide/contract a struct (named loc) declared in a signature, defined in a unit, and brought into the context by define-values/invoke-unit results in the following error message:

provide/contract: cannot determine the number of fields in super struct in: loc

Exporting with just "provide" works as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module test mzscheme
  (require (prefix c: (lib "contract.ss"))
           (prefix u: (lib "unit.ss")))
  
  (u:define-signature loc^ ((u:struct loc (debug))))
  
  (u:define-unit loc@
     (u:import)
     (u:export loc^)
     (define-struct loc (debug)))
  
  (u:define-values/invoke-unit loc@
     (u:import)
     (u:export loc^))
  
  (c:provide/contract
    [struct loc ([debug symbol?])])

 Matthew: this error message happens when the last element in the
 fields list of the info bound to the struct identifier is #f. I
 understand the docs to be saying that this means the number of fields
 is hidden.
 
 So .. it looks like a units problem? Is that right?
