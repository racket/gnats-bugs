>Description:
Is it possible in drshceme to create GUI but using style used in Visual Basic and Delphy. I.e. After visually created and edited user interface , just to 
be enough to describe only some event handlers and set some object properties to have an operational program ? 
This in addition to other things in drscheme .

Thanks

 We do have plans to build a visual GUI editor, yes. It won't be available
 in the next release (version 202), but possibly the one after.
