I'm using v370.3, built from svn on a Mac Pro OS X v10.4.10.  I had the int=
eractions canvas maximized, and was aimlessly clicking around the top left =
corner of the canvas when I received the following error message:

DrScheme Internal Error - modal dialog box
run-browser: process execute failed: ("osascript -e 'open location \"\"'")
Standard Output - dialog box
0:16: execution error: An error of type -673 has occurred. (-673)
run-browser: process execute failed: ("osascript -e 'open location \"\"'")

It didn't crash DrScheme, and I have no idea what I did to make it happen.

Sorry I can't be of more help,

 Did you click on the text in the top of the interactions window, maybe
 triggering a url?

Reason>>> robby replied, looks like it does't repeat so I'm closing it

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 09 Jul 2007 11:46:47 -0400
Reason>>> see last message
