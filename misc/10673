Using install-readline! puts (require readline/rep) in my .mzschemerc, but the docs say that it'll put (require readline). I think the docs are wrong, not the implementation, but I'm not sure so I'm submitting a bug.

 I also think that it should be kept as requiring `readline/rep' --
 because existing ".mzschemerc"s will have that, and because `readline'
 might do something other than just install itself in the repl (but
 this is unlikely for the same reason).
 
 I changed the docs to say `readline/rep', but the problem is that this
 is not described anywhere.  I'm not sure how to document it.
 
 Also, I've improved the code a little, and made it say what it did,
 and made it spit out a comment before the expression that it adds.

 If this change is a reasonable thing, then I think it should probably
 put a printf in the .mzschemerc too, eg:
 
 (require readline/rep)
 (printf "Installed readline\n")

 The addition of a `printf' in `install-readline!'
 is only to let you know when the file was modified (and how), and the
 addition of the comment is if you later look at the file.  Both are
 intended to help you to further tweak the file if you want to.
 
 The above is a constant reminder which is a different issue.  I think
 that I suggested it at some point (mostly since having readline when
 you run it inside Emacs can be awkward), and Matthew didn't want it.

 Yes: different issue, I agree. And I meant that different issue. Sorry
 for the lack of clarity.
 
 I don't have a strong opinion, but I definitely have a printout in my
 .mzschemerc. Not for emacs, but for scripts so that it helps me
 remember to use -q.

 Actually, with the new commadline flags, -q is much less relevant, isn't it=
 .
 
 Nevermind, then. lets just skip my suggestion.

 :) I was about to say that if you need -q the you must be dealing with
 scripts that really need to be upgraded...

Reason>>> I fixed most of this, still need to document `readline/rep' 
somehow, or just say that it's the internal module that does 
the rl repl.
