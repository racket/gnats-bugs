I have a wonderful iBook that runs OS X solely. I love it a whole lot. I however lack the ability to program Scheme on it. I was wondering if you could give me a little clue as to whether or not there is a OS X version on the way. Thanks.

 We're working on it, but we're very short on manpower.  If you're 
 willing to put up with a whole slew of minor bugs, you can use the 
 research version.  If you're enterprising and you have a compiler, 
 you can even try to fix some of them.
