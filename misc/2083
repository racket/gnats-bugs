>Description:
1. I just wondering about this program, why it can't display when i want to make a shortcut of this list ?

2. Why when i input a list from the file, my output list in scheme always show in the small capital letter, but i input it with all capital letter ?

Please reply me as soon as possible, because i have assignment due within this few days.

Thank You. 


>How-To-Repeat:
my list (kbase) :
(((add) (scheme primitive) (numerical operator) (adds numbers))
 ((and) (special form) (logic operator) (true only if all true))
 ((append) (list manipulator) (scheme primitive))
 ((arc) (semantic network part))
 ((bread-first search)))
and i want to display the (add numbers) which is in the first list from the kbase list.
And this is the sample of the output :

> (cadddar kbase)
. reference to undefined identifier: cadddar
> (car (cdr (cdr (cdr (car kbase)))))
(adds numbers)

Both of them should be given the same output, but why it said that cadddar is undefined ?

 Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.

 That's how the printer works, I believe.

 The Scheme standard R5RS only requires implementation to have up to
 4 d's and a's in list deconstructors, like cadar, cdddr, cddddr, etc.
