 This doesn't look like a problem with the ProfJ testing support to  
 me. I suspect it's with the graphical test boxes, and I don't know if  
 anyone is responsible for them. Possibly Matthew?

Responsible changed from "kathyg" to "eli" by eli at Sat, 06 Jan 2007 19:08:21 -0500
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sat, 06 Jan 2007 19:08:21 -0500
Reason>>> Seems like this is about the test suite boxes, which are
no longer maintained, and will be removed soon.
