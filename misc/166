Sent by mail to `scheme':

    I'm the same person who wrote in about the "all.zip" file.  Thanks 
  for fixing it.  Feeling impatient, I downloaded the documentation 
  separately.  In the process I discovered that your "Master Index" 
  file has some corrupted data in it.  I tried downloading it twice 
  with the same result.  Please check on it.  
    Once again, I am on the "Zipped HTML" page.  I have downloaded the 
  rest of the package on my machine and found it to work as expected, 
  so far.  

						      Thanks again, 
						       Joe Blask.

 Hmm, I can't seem to find the problem.  I tried downloading both
 all.zip and master.zip via netscape, unzipped the files (passed all
 the checksums) and ran netscape on the local copy.  I couldn't find 
 a problem.
 
 Can you be more specific?  Were these the files you had trouble with?
 Exactly what was corrupted?  
 
 Of course, the master index by itself will have many links that point
 to nowhere.  That wasn't the problem, was it?
 
 Perhaps unzip was keeping some of the old files and failing to replace
 them from the new zip file?  Try unzipping the files into a fresh 
 directory and see if works there.  Or better yet, just unzip all.zip,
 it contains the master index and everything else.

Unpacked, fixed and repacked the master.zip and all.zip files. 
I'm just waiting for confirmation from SPJN71A@prodigy.com 
to close the PR.

 Ok, I think I see the problem now.  The doc/master subdirectory
 had a 0-byte file named node* (with the * part of the name).
 This was causing problems for unzip in Windows, but my unix unzip
 utility didn't care, it just made a file named node*.
 This affected master.zip and all.zip.
 
 I unpacked the zip files, deleted node* and repacked them.
 Try fetching master.zip again and see if works any better.
