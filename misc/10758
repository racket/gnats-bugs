this is what I actually got with the in-range function:
1
1.2

Just try this code in DrScheme:

(for ((i (in-range 1 2 0.2)))
    (display i)

 Sorry, unfortunately not all of the real numbers are available to
 computers so various compromises are made, sometimes for efficiency
 (as in the case below).
 
 Specifically, in the code below, you're using decimal notation which,
 in most of our languages, translates into IEEE floating point numbers,
 which don't have all of the numbers that can be written with small
 numbers of decimal digits (they do have have all of the ones that can
 be written with a small number of digits in binary if that's an
 consolation).
 
 Anyways, if you want exact rational arithmetic, use 1/5 instead of 0.2
 in the ode below and you'll get what you're expected (altho it will
 print as fractions instead of decimals).
 
 hth,
 Robby
