>Description:
Reported by Paulo J. Matos, filename-extension in (lib "file.ss" "mzlib") returns buggy output if the inputted path contains an embedded period.  For example:

> (filename-extension "/home/pmatos/.ooffice2/profile/")
#"ooffice2/profile/"


I took a look at the code: it isn't doing a split-path as I had expected, so I modified the code to do the right thing:

(module fixed-filename-extension mzscheme
  (provide filename-extension)
  (define filename-extension
    (lambda (name)
      (unless (path-string? name)
        (raise-type-error 'filename-extension "path or string" name))
      (let-values ([(base name must-be-dir?)
                    (split-path name)])
        (and (not must-be-dir?)
             (let ([m (regexp-match #rx#"[.]([^.]+)$"
                                    (path->bytes name))])
               (and m
                    (cadr m))))))))

I hope this helps!
