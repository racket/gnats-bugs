>Description:
The "Check for Updates" menu item in DrScheme seems to work,
but it provides no visual feedback while working; the DrScheme
windows simply freeze.

There should be a dialog during the check to report that the
check is in progress, and to provide a button to cancel the
check.

>How-To-Repeat:
Select "Check For Updates"
Answer "yes" in the dialog
Try to use the DrScheme window after the dialog disappears.

 Now that I've tried the checker within the Windows installer, I'd say
 that the lack of visual feedback is particularly worrisome there.

 Yes, Robby and I have already discussed this for post-alpha1.
 
 I also need to make it so that the installers do the prompting, rather
 than the version checker, so (in Windows at least) the prompt can be
 before the files are copied.  In DrScheme, there doesn't really need to
 be a prompt, I think.
