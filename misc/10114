Not all of the mutable functions seem to exist.

Examples:
mcaar mcadr ...
mlist->list ...


I don't know if there should be support for others
Example:
msort

Also, your captcha hasn't ever changed.

 Some of these, like `mlist->list' are defined in the scheme/mpair
 library:
 
   http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/mpairs.html#(mod-path._scheme/mpair)

 In general, mutable pairs are used very infrequently in the PLT
 codebase, and many of these functions are just not needed.  For
 example, there is no need for `msort' for the few places that use
 mutable pairs.

 It is chosen randomly on every nightly build -- it's not really
 sophisticated, but it's enough to prevent the spam that was getting
 through.

 I have to say, the only times I have ever used a-lists I've needed them
 to be mutable.

 If you need mutable a-lists and you are working in PLT Scheme, perhaps
 you shoudl consider a hash-table instead (and nowadays, we have
 immutables hashes too (a balanced binary tree implementation)).
