>Description:
Follow the link "How to program in Scheme" from the first
page in help desk. There is no link to the Manuals from
there, despite the fact that manuals is a "sub item" in
list underneath "How to program in Scheme".

Also, I think that there should be more syntactic correlation
between the sub-sub items on the first page and the items in
the lists on the pages you get when you follow the 
"How to use Help Desk", "How to program in Scheme", 
"How to use DrScheme", ... links. Right now some of the
information is there, but you don't know what is what.

 If we decide to keep my changes to the Help Desk pages, this is fixed.
