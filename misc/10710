>Description:
I used `include-section' on a file that appeared fine to me, and got this error:

setup-plt: error: during Building docs for /home/samth/sw/plt-trunk/collects/typed-scheme/scribblings/ts-guide.scrbl
setup-plt:   (file "/home/samth/sw/plt-trunk/collects/scribble/decode.ss") broke the contract 
  (-> style? content? paragraph?)
 on make-paragraph; expected <content?>, given: (#<part-start>)

It seems from the blame (thanks Robby!) that this is a bug in Scribble.

 FWIW, This is not necessarily an error. I added the contracts based on
 the documentation and they may be wrong. I will do my best to debug.

 I bet it's a problem in `scribble/decode', which doesn't check enough
 about the content that it decodes.
