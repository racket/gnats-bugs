Aside from the fact that not everyone using the handin client is from the U of Utah, this seems like a possible trademark violation.  Probably won't get any actual complaints, but we should come up with a more generic default icon.

 This is bogus.  There is no icon that can be put there until there is
 a Single Global University.

 I doubt it.  University logo copyrights are usually very permissive.
 At least that was my experience in Cornell.  (Some like as long as you
 don't use the logo to promote the product as being a Cornell product.)

 I comitted some stupid "Your Icon Here" icon instead.

 Sure there is, an icon with the letters "HW" standing for "homework".
 Or just remove it.

 Sure; it's more a matter of courtesy and common sense to not default
 to "UU", rather than a matter of lawsuits.

 Also works.

 That's not an option.  If you remove it, almost nobody will know that
 they need to put one up.  Putting up a Utah logo makes that obvious,
 as I hope a "your icon here" icon.

 (I forgot to say that esp. in the case of Utah I don't think they
 could trademark a "red lowercase capital U".)

 There are probably more such cases.  It is not surprising that this
 happens in a collection that requires per-site customization.
