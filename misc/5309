>Description:
see the following program
it prints 
 5
 -
 6 
for z but should print 0. when you replace the second and third
integer declaration with real, it prints the same. in that 
case it should print an inexact. 

in general the type checker must be a type elaborator that 
inserts coercions at places where a lower type is used in 
a context with a higher type. for example, 

 z := x

would insert a coercion in front of x for the suggested
variant of the program. ditto for 

 z := x + 1

type checking is not enough


begin 
 integer x; 
 integer y; 
 integer z; 
 
 x := 5; 
 y := x + 1; 
 
 if (y > 0) then 
   z := x/y
 else 
   z := 1.0; 
   
 printnln(x);  
 printn(z); 

end
