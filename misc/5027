>Description:
shriram: could you please add a function 

  as-cgi : (Bindings -> Xexpr) -> Void 

to the cgi collection? i think for the standard
Scheme-cgi programmer, a cgi script should be a 
function from Bindings to Xexpr'esssions (as 
defined in the XML collection). if programmers
define cgi scripts that way, we can ask students 
to write 

 (as-cgi my-cgi-script)

and debugging etc follows more standard conventions.
