>Description:
post-pure-port falls into an infinite loop is the optional list-of-string argument is not given.  The bug is clearly at line 226 of url-unit.ss.  The code reads:

         [(url post-data) (post-pure-port url '())]

which recurs to the same case in the case lambda.  The correct code (as in post-impure-port) is

         [(url post-data) (post-pure-port url post-data '())]

I suppose there's a good argument that I should commit a fix myself since I have CVS access! ;-)

(require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
