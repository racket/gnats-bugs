 There are many uses of text that are not used in files.  When I talk
 about the `foo' procedure, I don't mean that you should type the
 quotes, and when I say that I said "foo", I mean that I said the word
 not including the quotation marks.  A single quote is, IIUC, Matthew's
 convention in that case for "a Scheme symbol".  If you have some
 better convention for such text, please just change the doc and
 commit.

 I really hope that our documentation has no convention for
 single-quote other than the Scheme meaning of single-quote.  Your use
 in the config.ss documentation doesn't seem consistent with that to
 me, at all.  That's all I'm trying to get across.
 
 To me, the word "symbol" refers to a Scheme value and "identifier"
 refers to the syntactic labels we write for them.  By my definitions,
 neither config.ss nor its documentation should refer to symbols at all
 for the keys, just identifiers.  I don't know how you make the
 value/syntax distinction in your terminology.

 It's not really an identifier -- #%info-lookup will look these values
 up by a given symbol.  A quoted one.  The infotab language happens to
 make it look like identifiers.
 
 In any case, I'm personally strict with using `foo' in text whenever I
 mean <code>foo</code>.  I did not change anything in this
 documentation because it already existed and because I prefer to go
 with the existing style when I'm extending existing code.  (Just like
 not changing choice of 70-char-wide text, where I usually prefer 72
 for "narrow text".)
 
 So like I said -- if you see a way to make the docs clearer, and
 you're willing to change them systematically, please feel free to do
 so.

 (Easy to explain my position when you're dealing with Scheme: an
 "identifer" is something that may have some extra color, and that may
 have lexical "issues".  According to this, the use of infotab files is
 using symbols.)
