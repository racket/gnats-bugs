>Description:
The header parsing that sirmail uses appears to
raise exceptions and cause sirmail to fail
for the following email message (this is the
contents of one of the numbered files in
sirmail's repository)

There may be extra newlines added in by
the bug report form. One thing I noticed:
in the Boundary line, there is a space
between the equal sign and the 5.

 Speaking of which, have you replied to a message from Danny DubÃ¨ in
 Sirmail before?
 
 Something used to choke on that, but maybe that's fixed now too? (now
 the SMTP server chokes ;)
