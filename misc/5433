>Description:
In an attempt to set PLTHOME, `make install` starts poking files in /usr/local/bin Should be done in rc-files for shells, preferably by sysadmin, or at least after asking for permission (messing in files that do not belong in your own package is not-done).

To make things worse, I installed open ssh in /usr/local, too.
`make install` of PLT scheme openly tells me it is looking in /usr/local/bin/ssh with the intent to modify it!!! Merely TOUCHING ssh
is something you should NEVER EVER do. (I don't scream often in postings like this, I'm really pissed.)

Finally, my window manager resides in the same directory, so the `make install` crashed with a "Text file in use".

The fact that this is the last step in the Makefile and I am (thus?) missing /usr/local/lib/plt enforces me to use this way to submit the bugreport.

 Yikes!
 
 The problem is that the installer doesn't expect PLT's "bin" to be
 /usr/local/bin, or any sort of shared "bin". Instead, it expects
 it's own tree, something like
 
   --prefix=/usr/local/plt
 
 This is due to an old directory structure that we're gradually
 improving. Meanwhile, I'll try to fix the immediate symptom (modying
 the wrong files) right away.
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew

 Let me hazard a guess: at some point during compilation, you typed this:
 
 configure --prefix=/usr/local
 
 you did this based on the README file, which says the following:
 
 ...
 For example, if you want to install into /usr/local/plt using
 dynamic libraries, then run
 
      configure --prefix=/usr/local/plt --enable-dynlib
 ...
 
 Here's the crucial difference: you left out the "plt" in the path. 
 With this omission, the install script attempted to place all its 
 files directly in /usr/local, with predictably grotesque results.
 
 Here's what you need to do: back out as carefully as you can, and 
 then start over, being sure to specify a directory that can be 
 overwritten.
 
 Here's what we need to do: be more clear in the README that the 
 directory specified will be overwritten.
 
 Thanks for your bug report,
