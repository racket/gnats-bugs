 Hi,
 
   Do you mind trying the same thing with the latest nightly release? It
 is available here:
 
   http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/
 
 (I'm intentionally being a bit opaque here -- DrScheme of course
 supports multiple args and the problem isn't a bug, but we have a lot
 of confusion along these lines. After you try the above, or if you
 write back and say you don't have time for such fooling around, I'll
 explain the whole story.)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Rats! You figured it out :)
 
 The new version has a new take on that "wrong initial language"
 problem. We get lots and lots of bug reports just like that one and
 tried to do something about it for the next release.
 
 Thanks,
