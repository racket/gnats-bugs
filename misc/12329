>Description:
Trying to learn macros, and watching what happens in the macro stepper.

When I step into good-swap! y temp, it names everything appropriately, including a
(set! temp temp)
(one of the temps is black, the other blue)

The bug has to do with the mouse-over arrows: both of the "temp"s in this set! point to the global variable, not to the local.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-syntax-rule (good-swap! x y)
  (local [(define temp x)]
    (set! x y)
    (set! y temp)))

(define x 4)
(define y 5)
(define temp 6)

(good-swap! y temp)
