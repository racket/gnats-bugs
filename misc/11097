>Description:
Why does generator accept (someday) a parameter list, but infinite-generator not?  I would like to say

(define web-table-colors
  (infinite-generator (c1 c2)
   (yield "white")
   (yield "grey")))

I can certainly already say

(define (wtc c1 c2)
  (infinite-generator
   (yield c1)
   (yield c2)))
(define web-table-colors (wtc "white" "grey"))

but it's not clear to me why generator plans to take arguments but infinite-generator doesn't.

(I also don't see why generator currently doesn't accept arguments, but maybe the implementation isn't the obvious one I'm thinking of.)

 I think `infinite-generator' should take arguments just like the regular 
 `generator', it was just an oversight. The plan was for `generator' to 
 take arguments.. Eli, did you want to implement that in the future for 
 some reason (as opposed to now)?
