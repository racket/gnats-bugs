>Description:
The as-distributed slatex.sty file contains two deficiencies:
    1) it uses TeX style font selection commands for LaTeX documents: this generates incompatibilities with some CTAN style files (manuscript being the most significant example)
    2) it does not understand the subfile style file distributed via CTAN.

This patch (which was submitted to the SLaTeX owner a couple of years ago) has never made it into the original source.  It would be nice if my favorite Scheme implementation was at least CTAN compliant.
