>Description:
When I run MrEd in MzOS, and I click the close box, I have to answer
the "Really quit" question twice; I think that's already a PR. the
MzOS-specific problem is that I see this error message on stderr:

  attempt to use an object shutdown by custodian (class canvas%)

That doesn't happen if I use File|Close.
