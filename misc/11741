>Description:
#lang planet neil/sicp; Determine language from source is selected

When I start DrRacket, every statement entered produces the following error: compile: unbound identifier (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) in: #%top-interaction

Then, when I click 'Run' and input my statement again, the problem goes away.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make sure '#lang planet neil/sicp' is written in the 'Automatic #lang line' and 'Determine language from source' is selected.
2. Exit and restart Dr.Racket.
3. In the lower window, type (+ 2 2) or any other expression, and the error will appear.

 This bug report belongs in the bug system for the neil/sicp, which is here:

 Be sure to choose the "component" field that matches neil/sicp.
 
 Let me know if you have trouble with this and I can help.
