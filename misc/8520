>Description:
I just found that there are two in consitencies under the implementation of R5RS in DrScheme:

1. define two list as follows:
(define ls1 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 5)))))
(define ls2 (cons (cons (cons (cons 1 2) 3) 4) 5))

then evaluate:
>ls1
(1 2 3 4 . 5)
>ls2
((((1 . 2) . 3) . 4) . 5)
The abbreviation (1 2 3 4 . 5) is a stuff not only confusing the programmer but also unconsistant to the result evaluated from ls2. 
Using the form (1 . (2 . (3 . (4 . 5)))) displayed as the result of evaluation of ls1 would be better. From its appearance we can easily find that how it is constructed and can distinguish it from ls2.

2. Scheme claims that symbols are not self-evaluated. So it introduces quote. But in DrScheme, () is a valid representation of empty list, at least our Dr. Scheme takes it right. It is against so-said "not self-evaluated". () should not be used to represent an empty list, instead, using '() which is less confusing and misleading. Because () can be regarded as "nothing done to nothing" in the sight of precedure!

 Your observations are both insightful.  It is for the reasons that  
 you cite (as well as others) that DrScheme includes the "teaching  
 languages," Beginning Student et. al.  I think that you will find  
 that the teaching languages address both of your concerns.
