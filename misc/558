>Description:
	I had to write the following signature and unit for my GC project: 

;; Scheme provides (bug): 
(define-signature schemeS (first second third rest))

(define schemeU
  (let ((f first) (s second) (t third) (r rest))
    (unit/sig schemeS
      (import)
      (define first f)
      (define second s)
      (define third t)
      (define rest r))))

	I consider these things primitives.

State-Changed-Why:
Of course, they aren't primitives right now.

Rather than adding them to MzScheme, perhaps the right solution is to
wait for the language-specifying units?
