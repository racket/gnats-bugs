>How-To-Repeat:
Hello Professor Menzel, 

I have been having an issue installing the C211 Handin for quite a while now. I have uninstalled DrRacket, restarted the program and everything, but everytime I do so, I get this error message above. I need to fix this problem as soon as possible so that I may start using my computer to work on assignments. Please let me know what I can do to solve this issue. 

Thank You, 
Vaishali Shenwai

 Yikes! Sorry you didn’t get a response on this.
 
 This error message here suggests that the student already had the handin package installed, and didn’t need to install it again. 
 
 Presumably, the student wouldn’t have notified you unless the installation of the handin package was somehow failing, though. In this case it would make sense to remove the package using DrRacket’s package manager (or the command-line 'raco pkg’ command), and then re-install it.
 
 The student points out that he or she tried uninstalling and re-installing DrRacket. I can see how it might have frustrated the student to see that this didn’t solve the problem. As it turns out, DrRacket stores its installed collections separately from the installed application, in order to be compatible with multi-user installations.
 
 Since this was submitted back in January, I’m hopeful that it’s now been resolved :). Please respond if any of your students are still having this problem.
 
 John Clements
