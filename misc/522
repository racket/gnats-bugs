The documentation for the testing engine is missing these
primitives/classes (and possibly others?):

They need to be added into some .cdb file. For now, they are named in
src/doc/excluded-names.ss. After they have been documented, they should be
removed from that file.

 The first four of these are in s+utils.cdb.
 
 Perhaps the remainder should be in toolbox.cdb.  What is 
 the difference between these classes and their non-testable
 counterparts?  Can they be listed as a group, with pointers
 to their counterparts?

 The difference is the added method, which allows the tester to work on
 them. They have to be documetned just like the other classes (which means
 that they will have pointers to their super classes). Probably
 s+classes.cdb is a better place for them.

 Where do you suggest placing the descriptions of the testing classes?
 
 What is the organization of the .cdb files?

 If Robby's there, it's probabbly easier if he can explain it in
 person. In short, toolbox.cdb and media.cdb contain the wx: stuff, and
 I don't know how the mred: files are arranged. Consider looking at the
 toolbox.dvi target in plt/src/doc/Makefile. Note that toolout.tex
 ("out , not "box") is the result of converting toolbox.cdb et al. into
 latex form.
