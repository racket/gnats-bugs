 Please note: this is not an OSX-specific bug; Under SunOS:
 
 Open Help Desk
 Choose Manuals
 Choose MzLib
 Choose Chapter 17: Match.ss
 
 Instead of the .gif, see a box with an X through it.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    my bug
State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 15 15:03:11 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    I broke Help Desk a couple of days ago by giving a
    parameter (the "show images in HTML" parameter) the
    wrong default.
    
    The fixed code is exp-tagged in CVS.
    
    Thanks for the report,
    Matthew
