>Description:
I've tried to use the library procedure for negative and it doesn't seem to work in the DrScheme but it does work in the MzScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Tried running: (negative? 3) in the Dr. Scheme and I get the error:

reference to undefined identifier: negative?

But it runs fine in the MzScheme.

 You probably need to set DrScheme's language to match MzScheme. See the
 Choose Language menu item in the Language dialog and look under the PLT
 tab.
