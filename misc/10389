>Description:
When I'm viewing a large reduction graph, trying to two-finger scroll vertically or horizontally on my laptop trackpad does nothing.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 03 Sep 2010 21:37:29 -0400
Reason>>> redex


Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Fri, 03 Sep 2010 21:40:23 -0400
Reason>>> this is just a standard pasteboard.   



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:33 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
