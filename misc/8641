>Description:
The program below raises two exceptions, but I think it shouldn't raise any.

The second one is the one that I need to work for drscheme (well, I'll just avoid copy-struct for now). I looked into it a little bit and it appears that the binding of `t' includes a #f in the accessors position as the last element of the list (in struct.ss, the variable accessors, bound on line 44) but it seems like all of the information should be there so that #f shouldn't be there.

That second one is probably two bugs, I guess -- copy-struct not dealing well with the situation of a #f (which I think is legal) and the #f even being there.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module sig mzscheme
  (require (lib "unit.ss"))
  (provide drscheme:language^
           empty^)
  (define-signature empty^ ())
  (define-signature drscheme:language^
    ((struct s (a)))))

(with-handlers ((exn? exn-message))
  (eval
   '(module n (lib "a-unit.ss")
      (require sig
               (lib "unit.ss")
               (lib "struct.ss"))
      
      (import drscheme:language^)
      (export empty^)
      
      (λ ()
        (copy-struct s 'bad-value
                     [s-a
                      'whatever])))))

(with-handlers ((exn? exn-message))
  (eval
   '(module m (lib "a-unit.ss")
      (require sig
               (lib "unit.ss")
               (lib "struct.ss"))
      
      (import drscheme:language^)
      (export empty^)
      
      (define-struct (t s) (b))
      
      (λ ()
        (copy-struct t 'bad-value
                     [t-b
                      'whatever])))))


the above produces:
