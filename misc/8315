>Description:
The exec command from sqlite.plt raises a DEP error on Windows XP.  I raise the issue here because it may be a more general problem with the ffi.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module test-sqlite mzscheme
  (require (planet "sqlite.ss" ("jaymccarthy" "sqlite.plt" 3 1)))
  
  (define my-db 
    (open (string->path "C:/test.s3")))
  
  (exec/ignore my-db "create table people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);")
  (display (insert my-db "insert into people (name) values ('joe');")) (newline)
  (display (insert my-db "insert into people (name) values ('dave');")) (newline)
  (display (insert my-db "insert into people (name) values ('sally');")) (newline)
  (display (insert my-db "insert into people (name) values ('ruth');")) (newline))

; If one requires the above module, the values 1 2 3 4 will be printed, so that
; everything seems to be working.  Next, try 

(exec my-db "select * from people;" (lambda (cols vals) (write vals) (newline)))

; and if DEP is turned on for this process (or for all processes without excepting
; DrScheme) Windows XP will stop the process and pop up an error dialog.

Reason>>> Ryan -- I'm moving it to you in case you know anything 
about the problem.  In any case, I'm going to close it 
since it's not a bug in the PLT tree.
Keith -- you should raise the problem on the plt-scheme 
list, or report to the author of the package.  (I'm not 
sure if Ryan can help.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Wed, 27 Dec 2006 15:10:46 -0500
Reason>>> See above.
