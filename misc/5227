>Description:
I am assuming that this is a documentation bug, and not a bug 
in the software. One could interpret "void-proc" as procedure 
that returns void in the following line. The purpose statement
don't make this clear either. 

(call/input-url url url->port-proc port->void-proc [list-of-strings]) -> void

  First argument is the URL to open.  Second is a procedure that takes
  a URL and turns it into a (pure or impure) port.  The third takes
  the (pure or impure) port and handles its contents.
>How-To-Repeat:
Proposed change: 

(call/input-url url url->port-proc port->X-proc [list-of-strings]) -> X

  First argument is the URL to open.  Second is a procedure that takes
  a URL and turns it into a (pure or impure) port.  The third takes
  the (pure or impure) port and handles its contents. The result of
  this process is the result of the call to call/input-url.
