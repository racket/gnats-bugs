The copy of "mzrice.exe" that ships with DrScheme 5.0 does not run;
it cannot locate the executable "mzscheme".

There is a small bug in "drstart\drstart.c" with the macro definition of
GOEXE.  For building DRSCHEME, it looks for "mred.exe", but for MZRICE
it looks for "mzscheme" (not the missing extension in the file name).

To fix, change:

# define GOEXE "mzscheme"

>How-To-Repeat:
Execute "mzrice\mzrice.exe" from the PLT home after installing DrScheme.

You'll get a message box stating that it cannot locate "mzscheme".

rebuild, and install the new mzrice.exe.  I'm sure the problem doesn't
exist with the UNIX version since it doesn't use file extensions, and your
Q/A didn't bother to test the command-line version of scheme in the
Windows environment.  Good thing I'm an old UNIX hack. :-)
