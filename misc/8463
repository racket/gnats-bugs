>Description:
When using the French version, the "details" panel of the
language dialog is much too wide with a reasonable default
on a 1024x768 screen.  I think that this is because of the
translation of the
  Command line arguments, as a vector blah blah blah...
line which is long enough in English to restrict the width too.
One solution is to find a shorter translation, but a better
solution might be to split the line to two or find a more concise
English text.

(Why must it be a vector syntax?  Wouldn't it make more sense to
make it space-dlimited expressions?)

 To make the point, two screen shots (of the whole screen):

Reason>>> .

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "meunier" by meunier at Tue, 24 Apr 2007 05:48:44 -0400

State changed from "open" to "closed" by meunier at Tue, 24 Apr 2007 05:48:44 -0400
Reason>>> I've changed the translation for the "command line argument"
part to make it a bit shorter.  This should help, though
it's still quite long.
