>Description:
After upgrading from 199.25 to 199.26 and deleting all of the .zos,
I ran setup-plt to rebuild them.  Unfortunately, it does this in an
order inconsistent with the various collections' dependencies, so you
have to run it twice to get everything to build.

On the first time through, it prints the following:
setup-plt: Making .zos for readline at /home/cobbe/plt/collects/readline
make: Failed to make compiled/pread.zo; load-extension: bad version 199.25 (not 199.26) from "/home/cobbe/plt/collects/readline/compiled/native/i386-linux/mzrl.so"

and continues to rebuild the .zos for the other collections.
Only after it's rebuilt the .zos does it recompile the readline .so;
running setup-plt again rebuilds the readline .zos as desired.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build & install 199.25; run setup-plt.
Install the 199.26 source in the same directory.
cd plt/src
./configure
make
make install
cd ..
find . -name \*.zo -print | xargs /bin/rm
./install
  # (answer Y to build .zos)
./install
  # (answer Y again)

 Quoting cobbe@alumni.rice.edu:
 > find . -name \*.zo -print | xargs /bin/rm
 > ./install
 
 I'll have to fix the installation instructions.
 
 When you upgrade a binary, don't re-run ./install. Instead, run
    setup-plt -c
 
 The -c will take care of deleting both .zo files and .so files, so you
 won't get the problem you saw with the first time around.
