 Currently there is no distinction in the generics system between optional
 methods (e.g. dict-set!, which only mutable dictionaries must implement)
 and required methods (e.g. dict-ref).  Probably there should be some, but
 there's no design in place for how that would work.  I think this has to be
 considered "working as intended" for now.
