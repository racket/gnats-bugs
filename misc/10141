>Description:
The SRFI says write-with-shared-structure and read-with-shared-structure must be exported.  write/ss and read/ss aliases are also suggested.  Currently, none of these are exported.  Also, different write and read are exported, which the SRFI does not specifiy, and they conflict with those from (rnrs).
