>Description:
The program below produces

require: unknown module: 'program

but I think it should not do that. I think the sandbox has to take care when it evaluates its own module declarations to set current-module-declare-name to #f or something like that.

#lang racket/base
(require racket/sandbox)
(parameterize ([current-module-declare-name
                (make-resolved-module-path 'anything-except-program)])
  (make-evaluator 'racket/base))
