>Description:
In some cases, when a debugging session is started, and for each subsequent step, a new tab will open in the window.

This does not happen all of the time, but it happens quite frequently. I am not sure what the cause is.
>How-To-Repeat:
I am not sure how to tell you to reproduce this, other than sending you a file that will cause this to occur. If you chose to investigate this, I would be happy to send a file over.
