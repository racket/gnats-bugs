 I don't get that error with the above program. For me, the `slideshow'
 binding for `struct' shadows the scheme' bindings, as it should.
 
 
 I do get the error with
 
  #lang scheme/base
  (require scheme slideshow)
 
 I dont see an easy solution, though, and I'm inclined to chalk this up
 as one of the minor incompatibilities of v5.0.
