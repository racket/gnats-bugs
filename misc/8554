If the libmzsch project in the mzscheme solution is built by itself, the build fails because it is missing a dependency on libmzgc.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open the mzscheme solution.
2. Clean the solution.
3. Right-click libmzsch project and build it.

There are unresolved references to symbols in libmzgc. After adding the dependency on libmzgc, there are only three unresolved symbols left in network.obj, but I will open a different bug for that once I figure out what it is supposed to depend upon.

 I'm puzzled by this one. Line 11 of "mzscheme.sln" seems to declare a
 dependency on libmzgc for libmzsch. Also, the dependency is properly
 displayed in VS for me.
 
 I'm using VS Express 2005, no Vista update. Does the SP1 or Vista
 update cause the solution or project files to be converted when opened?

 Thanks! I'm forwarding this to bugs@plt-scheme.org for the record, and
 in case Eli has a chance to look into it. I'm on my way out of town.

 I don't follow this -- there is a GUID mismatch between which files?

 Each project file has a GUID in it. The solution file references both
 the project file and its GUID. It then uses the GUID when adding
 dependencies and storing the associated project configurations for a
 solution configuration and perhaps other stuff. The GUID in the libmzsch
 project file is not the GUID listed for the libmzsch project in the
 MzScheme solution file. Likewise for the other dependencies that aren't
 working right.

 IIUC, the problem is, for example, that mzscheme.sln has this line:
 
   Project("{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}") = "libmzsch", "..\libmzsch\libmzsch.vcproj", "{2D99E176-BCA5-4B8E-B25C-1B2D7179C188}"
 
 whereas mred.sln has
 
   Project("{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}") = "libmzsch", "..\libmzsch\libmzsch.vcproj", "{A6713577-7DFB-48F8-B8C1-7DB2D7C51F90}"
 
 and {A6713577-7DFB-48F8-B8C1-7DB2D7C51F90} is the correct GUID for the
 libmzsch solution (so mred.sln is fine, but mzscheme.sln is not).  I
 grepped the rest, and the bogus GUID in mzscheme.sln
 ({2D99E176-BCA5-4B8E-B25C-1B2D7179C188}) is not found elsewhere.  So
 it's possible that this is a mistake that got into the files at some
 point (maybe DevStudio's conversion of .sln files?).
 
 In any case, if the only problem is with libmzsch and the solution is
 replacing the bogus GUID with the real one, then I can do it
 manually.  But chasing these things manually sounds like a bad idea --
 it would help if you can list all broken dependencies.  (I'll fix the
 files and send you a zip file to try out.)

 Yes, I think you understand correctly. For the MzScheme solution, the
 dependencies I had to add between projects were:
 
 MzScheme depends on libmzsch
 MzScheme depends on libmzgc
 libmzsch depends on libmzgc
 
 I also had to add a non-project dependency for libmzsch on Ws2_32.lib
 
 I'll try going through the other solutions tomorrow and see if I run
 into problems with them.

 OK.

 I'm not sure about this one -- is it available in all Windows
 configurations?

 OK, I'll wait for your email after you do that then.  I prefer doing
 all of this in one shot to minimize possible problems.

 I have run into some other issues preventing me from getting through the
 entire process.
 
 The current issue is that the WX_DC.cxx file in the wxwin project of the
 mred solution includes <gl/glaux.h>
 
 That header is not available in the Windows Vista SDK and according to
 the OpenGl Website at
 http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/gettingstarted.htm#0080 is
 not even supported or recommended. GLUT should be used instead.
 
 What should be done about this?

 OK, I did that too.  One unrelated thing that your patch did was to
 change the order of these two lines:
 
 	GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution
 		Release|Win32 = Release|Win32
 		Debug|Win32 = Debug|Win32
 	EndGlobalSection
 
 in your patch the debug configuration was first.  I don't know if it
 makes any difference, so I left the lines in the original order.
