>Description:
Similar to 8805 if I click debug a new window opens.  Then if I step, a new window opens.

This is on 371 even though I thought it would be fixed after 370.  I might try a nightly build.
>How-To-Repeat:
open any scm program.  click debug, click step.  done.
>Fix:
Download a recent nightly build, check out from subversion, or use an operating system other than Windows.
