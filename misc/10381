Trying to install the attached package on version 4.2.1 (with Windows XP) results to the following error (during building doc with scribble), while version 4.2 works fine:

 This is probably a result of the (get-module-code path) in the sandbox
 code, which is used to compute the needed paths for some imports.
 (Which I comitted in June 15th, so it wasn't a problem in 4.2.)
 
 Matthew: it looks like it should change to either:
 
 * catch the `make-exn:get-module-code' exception and assume 
 
 * or use (get-module-code path "compiled" compile void)
 
 and both don't look too great (in the first, it might mask other
 errors, and in the second the "compiled" name gets hardwired into a
 new place).  Is one of these acceptable?  Or maybe there's something
 else that can be done?
