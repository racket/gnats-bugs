>Description:
In the `PLT DrScheme: Programming Environment Manual', let's go to the
node `Interface Essentials', which is the 1st subnode of  the node
`Using DrScheme'.   The top looks like:

Next: Buttons Up: Using DrScheme Previous: Using DrScheme

I say (from my Emacs experience) that this is wrong.  I say the node
`Interface Essentials' has no previous.   The on-line help in Emacs
will not list a previous if you're at the first node of a submenu.
