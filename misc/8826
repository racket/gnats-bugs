>Description:
summary pretty much says it all.
>How-To-Repeat:
create bug.ss with these three lines of content:

(module bug mzscheme
(require
  (lib "time.ss" "srfi" "19")))

create Makefile with these two lines:

check:
	mzc --exe bug bug.ss  && ./bug

Type "make check".  You'll see

make check
mzc --exe bug bug.ss  && ./bug

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt at Wed, 25 Jul 2007 08:40:32 -0400
Reason>>> runtime path

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 25 Jul 2007 08:40:32 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

(The last time someone hit this, we didn't have a solution.
Now we do: `define-runtime-path'.)
