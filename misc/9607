>Description:
hangman.ss teachpack promises that it only calls its argument with symbols, but it also calls it with void.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the program below. Click the check button a whole bunch. After iterating thru the body parts, draw-next-part is called with void.

#lang scheme
(require htdp/hangman)

(define (reveal-list chosen status guess) '(a))
(define (draw-next-part body-part)
  (printf "body-part ~s\n" body-part))

(start 200 200)
(hangman-list reveal-list draw-next-part)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "matthias" by matthias at Wed, 16 Jul 2008 11:05:48 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Wed, 16 Jul 2008 11:05:48 -0400
Reason>>> the teachpack assumed that the select-body-part function wouldn't be called 
beyond the end of the game but the gui allows it; the fix asks the student's code to 
draw the left leg (last body part) to be drawn over and over again (a visual no-op if 
the program got that far); the right solution is to grey out the select button ... 
another day 

working on the bug also revealed an omission in the contract checking (range) for 
the functions; they also allowed void to leak back into student code (but this wasn't 
the bug); fixed 

finally, i also discovered a doc bug that somehow snuck through the scribble 
conversion; fixed 

the following program is in student languages and allows a better interpretation of 
things 

(define (reveal-list chosen status guess) '(a))

(define (draw-next-part body-part)
  (begin
    (printf "body-part ~s\n" body-part)
    #t))

#;
(define (draw-next-part body-part)
  "this revealed an omission in the teachpack"
  (printf "body-part ~s\n" body-part))

(start 200 200)
(hangman-list reveal-list draw-next-part)
