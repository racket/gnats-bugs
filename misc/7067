>Description:
The feature of checking for more recent versions in the setup window is nice, but then it is not clear what one is supposed to do.  The only options are next and back, neither of which seems appropriate.  My choice was to close the window, then download the patch and install the patch.  But then it was not at all obvious how to get the setup window again.  My first attempt was to reinstall the whole system, but that had no effect.  Finally, I looked through the . files and deleted something that looked appropriate, which did the trick.  But it would be better if there were an obvious way to cancel the   
initialization process, or if modifying the system in some way would cause it to be rerun.

 Thanks for the report, Julia. Indeed, the versioning system is not
 well-integrated into the startup process. Hopefully we'll find some
 time to improve this. Right now we have the bare minimum so that people
 who download old versions at least know about it.
 
 Just for you own peace of mind if this happens again, there is nothing
 in the startup "wizard" that isn't also elsewhere in DrScheme.

 Took some time...  But this is finally done -- the whole "check for
 updates" thing is completely different, and much more similar to
 standard "check for updates" options in popular applications.
