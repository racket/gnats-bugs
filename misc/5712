>Description:
When Scheme is loading(progressing bar, at the end)
scheme seems to access the A:drive (floppy-disk)twice?
I have some troubles with the interface, windows.
Whan i am scrolling the input or output windows,
some part of the "lift" is becoming black and there seems to be 
some "deadlock" "or auto-input". By taking the cursor on the scrolling
zone, without asking for scrolling, I do have scrolling of the
windows.

I have also some access to the hard drive(long!)
I did try to change from the big version of Dr Scheme to the
"standard" DR Scheme 200. Same thing.
So, so "bugs" with the interface.

But DR scheme seems quicker, I did try the simple factorial
for big numbers.

Well, I am very happy with the new versions.


I am more and more thinking using DrScheme for my IT stuff,
meaning shifting from things done at home to working "pro" tools.
Can we, one day, have the release on a CD?

Thank you.

Yours Sincerely.

Jerome HUCK.

 This one is fixed in v201, which we expect to release today.

 I occassionally see that, too. We'll fix that bug for the next release.

 I'm not sure what you mean. Can you provide more details?

 DrScheme is indeed faster with big numbers. Otherwise it's about the
 same, though.
 
 > Can we, one day, have the release on a CD?
 
 That's a good idea, and one that we've kicked around. So far, we
 haven't had time.
 
 Also, with internet connections and CD burners being so common, we
 wonder whether it's actually worth producing CD copies ourselves.
 
 Thanks for the feedback!
 Matthew

 Dear Matthew
 
 Thanks for the answer.
 
  I have also some access to the hard drive (long some seconds ten maybe)
 I did try to change from the big version of Dr Scheme to the
 "standard" DR Scheme 200. Same thing.
   I'm not sure what you mean. Can you provide more details?
 
 It is like Drscheme is saving a file whan I make some modification to a
 code.
 (related to the Interface "problem"?) I have also some delay/dealock when
 accessing a file menu sometime. Keep in touch.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Jerome HUCK.

 From jerome huck
 
 Dear Mattthew,
 I dowloaded today the new version of DrScheme.
 It is Ok for the A:drive floppy disk access and the deadlock/autoscrolling
 with the input/output text is ok. Still form time to time the black zone on
 the right.
 
 The help desk seems not to work.
 When I tried to use it,
 I did have:
 tcp-listen: host not found: 127.0.0.1 in a Standard Output window and a tiny
 window with Dr Scheme Internal error.
 
 
 Thanks.
 
 Yours Sincerely.
 
 Jerome HUCK.

 To Matthew Flatt.
 
 Dear Matthew,
 Some ideas, maybe to be included one day in a new version of DrScheme,
  - some changes in the general interface for the two "input and output"
 standard windows
 of Drscheme. Instead, the general interface(main window, menus,...) in a MDI
 window, with two
 sizable stand alone windows within the general MDI windows for the input and
 output
 windows?
 
 I did have some troubles (Internet connection) when I downloaded the on-line
 documentation for the help
 desk.
 Some capabilities to re-download the documention and the capabilities to
 overwrite the existing one (if not
 the full version because of download troubles)
 
 Thanks for giving us DrScheme.
 
 Jerome HUCK.
