>Description:
1) In the documentation, thunk is nowhere to be found.
2) The documentation references an argument proc that doesn't
   appear in the Procedure: line.

Procedure:  (with-input-from-file string thunk)
Procedure:  (with-output-to-file string thunk)

String should be a string naming a file, and proc should be a procedure of no arguments. For with-input-from-file, the file should already exist; for with-output-to-file, the effect is unspecified if the file already exists. The file is opened for input or output, an input or output port connected to it is made the default value returned by current-input-port or current-output-port (and is used by (read), (write obj), and so forth), and the thunk is called with no arguments. When the thunk returns, the port is closed and the previous default is restored. With-input-from-file and with-output-to-file return(s) the value(s) yielded by thunk. If an escape procedure is used to escape from the continuation of these procedures, their behavior is implementation dependent.

 Hm... this is a typo in "Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language
 Scheme", the quasi-official Scheme standard. I suppose we can fix it in
 our copy, but I worry about losing the change in the future.
 
 Any opinion, Paul?

 I think we should fix it in our copy, with a note indicating 
 the change.
 
 I'll send mail to Richard Kelsey.

 OK, I've fixed the typo in our HTML copy of R5RS, marking the
 change with a note.
 
 I'm unable to change the PDF version, which is all bitmaps.
 But Help Desk users will see the corrected version.
