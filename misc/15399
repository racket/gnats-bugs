>Description:
I accidentally searched for

https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/%20tabular

This should have given a page-not-found error (ideally displayed nicely). Instead it produced

403 Forbidden

Reason>>> Fixed. The "page-not-found.html" document had gotten lost, and other 
style information was reverted. Not sure why, yet, but we'll figure out 
which thing went wrong.
