>How-To-Repeat:
The fix seems to be to change pin-under to this:

 (define (pin-under base dx dy target)
	(cc-superimpose
	 (place-it 'pin-under #t (launder (ghost base)) dx dy target)
	 base))

The call to launder wasn't there before. Without it, there
seem to be exponentially many sub-picts building up in
some list somewhere.

This also suggests that maybe the subpicts should be kept
in some data structure that support constant-time appends
and only flattens on a search. Maybe.

I've committed the fix above, but I'm submitting this just
in case its interesting.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Mon, 16 Oct 2006 23:22:07 -0400
Reason>>> slideshow (?)


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 15 Nov 2006 17:11:16 -0500
Reason>>> As far as I can tell, this change breaks pin-under. Laundering the base
means that nothing could be found by `place-it'.

I moved the `launder' to the second argument of `cc-superimpose'
instead. The example program still runs, and `pin-under' seems to
work.

(I ran into the pin-under bug last week, and I've only just now
connected it to this PR.)

 That doesn't make any sense! The pict is duplicated -- how can the
 launder possibly cause a problem?
 
 Unless the code in svn didn't match the code in the PR?

 I think the confusion is that the `pin-under' procedure has two modes:
 
   (pin-under pict dx dy pict) -> pict
   (pin-under pict sub-pict find-proc pict) -> pict
 
 and these two modes are not reflected in the argument names `dx' and
 `dy':
 
       (define (pin-under base dx dy target)
         (cc-superimpose
          (place-it 'pin-under #t (launder (ghost base)) dx dy target)
          base))
 
 When `dx' is a pict, it can't be found by `place-it' in `(launder
 (ghost base))'.

 Oh, of course. Stupid me!
