State-Changed-Why:
Cormac, looks like you submitted this problem, but it's closed and
there's no Audit Trail indicating how it got closed.  Did you close
it?  It looks like the problem was that case-sensitivity was turned
off, in which case the error message is legitimate.  Without knowing
where and how you were running M3, I can't tell whether or not
case-sensitivity should have been on.

Please reply so I can close this problem or do something appropriate.

State-Changed-Why:

The problem was that the case-sensitivity parameter was turned on in
my configuration, so Ref and ref were confused.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
Just getting it out of category `all'.  I assume this is the right
thing to have done.  This was a non-bug.
