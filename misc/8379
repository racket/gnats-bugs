dynamic-require: unknown module: #%mred-kernel; need to run in MrEd instead of MzScheme

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gcooper" by eli at Mon, 11 Dec 2006 23:19:51 -0500
Reason>>> FrTime


State changed from "open" to "feedback" by gcooper at Tue, 12 Dec 2006 01:14:37 -0500
Reason>>> made the requested change (added frtime-lang-only.ss in
revision 5088); note that MrEd was required for the REPL's
value snips, not for the animation library


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 14:55:10 -0500
Reason>>> actually fixed
