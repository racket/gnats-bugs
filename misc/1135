MS Windows 95
>Description:
I can start Dr Scheme one time and it seems to work 
(I haven't really gotten far with it).  If I close
Dr Scheme, though, I must restart the computer (Win95)
in order to start Dr Scheme again.  If I do not restart
the computer, Dr Scheme makes it most of the way across the
progress meter on the splash screen and then opens a single
window that says simply:

compound-unit: compound unit exported variable not found 
for tag "zodiac", name "get-list-micro"

>How-To-Repeat:
Run Dr Scheme.  Close it.  Try to run it again.

 Hi Tom,
 
 This is a strange bug. So is the Start button bug you reported. We
 haven't seen anything like either before.
 
 Tell me more about your Windows 95 machine (how much memory, what
 processor, any fancy system extensions, etc.).
 
 Another test: start the resource monitor before running DrScheme, and
 let us know what values the monitor reports before and after running
 DrScheme. (The resource monitor program comes with Windows 95. I think
 it's usually in the Utilities folder under the Start menu.)
 
 I think there's another tool that shows the amount of free memory in
 the system. (It may be called "Performance Monitor"; I forget.) Does
 starting DrScheme and quitting make the free memory go down overall?
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Matthew

We tentatively assume Windows weirdness, esp. since no one else has
