 The `install' script assumes that standard programs like `awk' and
 `cat' are in your path.
 
 It's fairly unusual for `awk' to be absent (it's in /usr/bin/awk in
 most Linux installations), but we can easily modify the install script
 for future versions to avoid it.
 
 Meanwhile, your best bet is to make sure `awk' is in your path when
 running the install script.

Verified that `awk' is in the set of things
installer should be able to expect. (List of
such programs is in the configue doc.)
