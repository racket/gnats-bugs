>Description:
The first page of all PLT manuals says

  This manual was typest using ...

That should be "typeset".

Also, in the FAQ, the Windows installer is 
mentioned as "plt.exe" (the part about corrupt 
installations).  For a few versions, the 
installer executable is named plt-xxx.exe, where
xxx is the version number.  

Also in the FAQ, I think the size of the distribution 
archives can be omitted.  The current size is 
larger than that mentioned in the FAQ; the download 
pages automatically indicate the size of the file
to be downloaded.
