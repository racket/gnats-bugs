>Description:
1. Install the teachpack sound.ss from the HtDP+ web site 
following instructions 

2. Add sound.ss teachpack from ../Library/PLT Scheme/205/teachpacks
and enjoy (speak 'hello). 

3. Now add draw.ss, which is in the plt teachpack directory. 

4. Click "execute" and see this error message: 

The teachpack file /Users/matthias/plt/teachpack/htdp/draw.ss
did not load properly. open-input-file: cannot open input file:
"/Users/matthias/Library/PLT Scheme/205.5/collects/htdp/draw.ss" 
(No such file or directory; errno=2)

5. Something during installation seems to affect the collects 
path so that it is no longer possible to find collects in the
standard collects/htdp directory from a teachpack.

 The problem is that your .plt installation has left you with two htdp
 collections and the collection system doesn't really work well in that
 situation. You have one in ~/Library/PLT\ Scheme/collects and one in
 PLTHOME/collects. The collection-path function (which is what require
 eventually calls) only looks for the first one. Require doesn't look
 beyond that, ie it does this:
 
   (require (lib "x.ss" "x-coll"))
 
   ... (build-path (collection-path "x-coll") "x.ss") ...
 
 So, if there's more than one x-coll, one with x.ss and one without, you
 might get the right one and you might not.
 
 Two solutions:
 
  1) force the .plt file to install itself into PLTHOME/... whatever.
     This is not the best choice (because it means site wide
     installation and has potential permissions problems)
 
  2) don't use the name htdp for the collection in the .plt file. That
     probably works best.

 In 204, for which this teachpack was last built, I wanted to install 
 these
 things into the "right" place, i.e., where they come from in my world.
 
 Okay, so I should build a teachpack suitable for 205. The teachpack
 consists of things that come from three different sources. They fall 
 into
 two categories:
   - two documentation files that describe the sound teachpack API
   - the code.
 If I want help desk to see the new documentation, how can I do this
 without forcing the docs to go into a standard plt directory?
 
 For 206 and successors, I have two choices:
   - just put everything into the bundle
   - keep providing a teachpack via .plt
 [I did the .plt thing over the past few releases because sound only
 works on Unixs. It's also large but small cmp'ed to what we already
 distribute.]
 
 What should I do?

 Help Desk has been rewritten to deal with multiple collections all
 named "doc" in post v205. In v205, nothing good can be done docs -- you
 have to have the docs put into PLTHOME/collects. So, for now, I would
 say just make the .plt install in a PLTHOME relative place. 
 
 This is the problem with the .plt that Noel Welsh built:
 schemeunit.plt. You may remember the (multiple) PRs...

 The correct and possibly even feasible fix is to get sound working and
 then put this teachpack into the distribution. If that's not possible,
 just stick with the .plt that installs into PLTHOME/collects/,
 probably. Depends on the sound plan.
