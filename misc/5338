 Hopefully one of the dialogs in DrScheme told you about this DLL. If
 not, probably Robby just hasn;t gotten back to this. Or maybe I forgot
 to tell him about it, though I had planned to, once.
 
 For Windows "stand-alone" executables, you need two to three DLLS.
 
 Naturally, they're installed on your machine. But they're in the PLT
 directory, where the system can't find them as you start the
 executable.
 
 What should we do? I see two options:
 
  A) Have the installer put the DLLs into the system directory. Main
     drawbacks: (1) well-known DLL hell, (2) how would you find them
     when you want to move the executable to a different machine?
 
  B) Copy the DLLs to the target directory when creating an executable.
     Not appealing, but maybe the best strategy.
 
  C) Un-DLL our code. That's probably a step too far backwards.
 
 I vote for B, though reluctantly.

 Option 4:  Add the PLT directory to the DOS PATH.  Now, it's an
 convenience to have the user do that, and it's different in Win9x and
 NT/2000/XP.  Maybe we can do this dynamically with setenv before any of
 the .DLL's are loaded.

 No it didn't tell me about dll's.

 I was aware of that, but I thought after our dialog with my eager
 undergraduate we would have solved this differently.

 I don't understand the options enough, but I propose that a MakeExecutable
 on Windows should create a directory and inside the directory is an
 exectuable and the dlls that it needs. 
 
 I could start the thing from my bash shell just fine.

 Probably because PLTHOME is in your path.
 
 They don't call it "DLL hell" for nothing. We're just scratching the
 surface.

 It only shows up when you actually have the choice between standalone
 executables and launchers. 
 
 But, I think that we should not present such options to users of the
 teaching langiages. Things must just work there, so I'm against
 providing such a warning to them, unless there isn't a better option.

 If you look at the audit trail for this PR, you'll see I suggested
 adding PLTHOME to the PATH, which is used when loading .DLL's.
 
 So I ran an experiment to confirm this works.
 
 I built "hello.dll", from the examples directory, and mv'd it to a
 directory not in my PATH, G:\.
 
 The following program just extends the PATH with G:\, and prints out the
 return value of LoadLibrary().  The extension is successfully loaded,
 according to that return value.  If I comment out the _putenv(), the
 return value indicates an error.
 
 	#include <stdlib.h>
 	#include <stdio.h>
 	#include <windows.h>
 	
 	int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 	{
 	    char path[2048];
 	    sprintf(path,"PATH=%s;g:\\",getenv("PATH"));
 	    _putenv(path);
 	    printf("load: %X\n",LoadLibrary("hello.dll"));
 	    return 0;
 	}
 
 So I think my suggested technique will work.
