>Description:
Reported by Franklin Chen (chen@adi.com).  He claims that the
SunOS/Motif version of DrScheme appears to be version 47.  I think he
is right: the file is

-rw-r--r--  1 scheme    1569133 Jan 11 17:49 plt.sparc-sunos4-motif.tar.gz

It's worth noting that there are other old files there.  These should
be deleted or updated:

-rw-r--r--  1 scheme    1568512 Jan 11 18:01 plt-68k-mac.sit.bin
-rw-r--r--  1 scheme    2172033 Nov 13  1996 plt.68k-mac.sit.hqx
-rw-r--r--  1 scheme      16070 Feb  3 12:24 plt.patch.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 scheme    2294459 Nov 13  1996 plt.ppc-mac.sit.hqx

 The problem is that there is not SunOS Motif version anymore. There is
 a Solaris Motif version, instead. The platform listing needs to be
 changed to reflect this. (It's in compiled.thtml.)
