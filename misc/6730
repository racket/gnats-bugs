 The dot in "(5 . 6)" is not a decimal point, it is the way that a cons
 cell is printed.  A cons cell has two parts and it is usually printed
 as "(", the first sub-value, " . ", the second part, ")".  To learn
 about these things it is probably best if you start at
 www.schemers.org and see the learning materials there.

 And you got a reply in 2004 -- I only sorted out old bug report,
 that's all.
