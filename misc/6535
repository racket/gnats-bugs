Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 05:09:02 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 12:07:21 -0400
Reason>>> Closing.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 12:07:21 -0400
Reason>>> I'm closing this because the packing process is now
different so this problem is probably solved.  FWIW, looks
like the original report is bogus -- trace.ss is not a
teachpack.
