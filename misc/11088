Racket language mode extends the syntax for the number tower such that exponents and decimals are accepted in bases other than 10. (e.g. #xelf). However, when I am in R5RS mode or R6RS mode, I would like the parser to parser numbers according to the standard. Racket still allows Racket numbers and therefore accepts bad input.

This was discussed briefly on the user mailing list.

 Does the standard say that an error must be raised, or does the
 standard merely say that you should not write such programs?

 Racket's R6RS mode does not accept the extended grammar.
 
 Racket's R5RS mode does accept the extended grammar. That's generally
 in line with the R5RS policy of allowing implementations to provide
 extensions. I can see why someone might want a more restricted grammar
 in R5RS mode, though, and we'd happily accept patches; otherwise, it's
 low on our list of priorities.
