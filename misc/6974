>Description:
I just did a cvs update -dPr exp and build.  Everything went fine, until setup-plt tried to build the .zo files for the plot collection.  It failed with the following error:

setup-plt: Compiling .zos used by HtDP Teachpacks
setup-plt:   in /Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/htdp/
setup-plt:   in /Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/
load-extension: bad version 208 (not 208.1) from "/Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/compiled/native/ppc-macosx/fit-low-level.so"

setup-plt: Compiling .zos used by Plot library
setup-plt:   in /Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/
load-extension: bad version 208 (not 208.1) from "/Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/compiled/native/ppc-macosx/fit-low-level.so"

I tried rerunning setup-plt and got the same results.  Then I deleted the
broken .so file and reran setup-plt and everything completed successfully.

solve it, whoever takes over your bugs will need to.)

 Okay. I looked at it some yesterday and I don't see why plot-low-level
 re-builds fine but fit-low-level does not. I'll keep looking.

Reason>>> The plot installer was rewritten for v299.  If it does
have similar bugs, please re-report -- the code has no
relation to the previous version anyway.
