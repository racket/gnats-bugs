I have downloaded DrScheme twice now, once from Tubingen and once from
Rice. In both cases the result is the same. The loading and expansion
process seems to work without problems or any intervention from me. When
I then double-click on the DrScheme icon to start, I get the "Standard 
"Output" window with the message
 require-library: collection not found: "drscheme" in any of: ( )
It is not possible to do anything to make DrScheme run, as far as I can 
see.

MrEd runs OK.

The DrScheme icon shows a green component (small thick arrow?) at its
bottom right. Maybe this indicates that something is incomplete after
downloading and expansion? There is no such mark on the MrEd icon.

 Did you have an old DrScheme installation, and did you uninstall it?
 You may need to manually delete some files if you have a pre-100
 version.
 
 If that's not the problem, try setting the PLTHOME environment variable.
 On Windows, the value is usually 
 
    "C:\Program Files\PLT"
 
 Use a suitable value if you installed to a different location.

 I'm not familiar with this problem on the Mac.  It could have
 something to do with the MacOS version.  What version are you 
 running?

 Yes, 101 is the current version.

 This is/was an old story, but I haven't heard from you since my reply
 to the message of 22 Nov 99. I guess my problem was one of those things
 for which there was no obvious cure, so that it was not worth following
 up further.
 
 Since then I have been living well enough with MrEd, which was the only
 piece of your Scheme material that was accessible and worked when I loaded
 everything. But now I have another question related to it, which
 presumably I could have answered by looking at some help file or similar
 information which came with Scheme - but no such files are accessible, for
 the same reason (presumably) that Scheme as a whole didn't load/work. So,
 I'll be very grateful for any suggestion from you about how to answer it.
 
 I have been given a file, produced on a Mac and quite compatible with my
 set-up, whose contents are of the form ( atom1 atom2 ..... atom? ), where ?
 is a large but not ridiculous number, probably about 3500. I could treat this
 as straight input to MrEd if the contents before that were (define xxx '
 and after it were )) . The only problem is that the only editor that my
 environment tries or allows me to try on the file is SimpleText, and 
 SimpleText, being simple, says that this file is too long for it to open. So,
 I need another way to load the data when MrEd is running.
 
 If there was a function of a kind (read1) or (read1 x), where x is the name
 of the file, and where the value is the next S-expression (sorry for using old
 classical LISPspeak) not yet read from x, that would do 100% of the job.
 Unfortunately I don't know what this function is, or what sequence of
 functions (e.g. with one to declare what the input file is, another to open
 it, another to read, then one to close) should work for MrEd. Unfortunately
 also, it doesn't seem that the I/O parts of the various Schemes obey much of
 a standard yet, so I haven't been able to guess (i.e. none of my guesses
 has worked).
 
 If you can tell me what the relevant functions in MrEd are, I'll be very
 grateful.
 
 Thanks in advance for your comments.

 Try 
 
   (let ([input-port (open-input-file filename)])
     (let loop ()
       (let ([exp (read input-port)])
         (unless (eof-object? exp)

 I thought I'd replied to you; mea culpa.  The problem you're having 
 is that MrEd (and/or mzscheme) can't find your collects directory. 
 Here are some things for you to check:
 
 For the rest of this e-mail, I will refer to the folder obtained by 
 unpacking the compressed drscheme distribution as the "plt root." 
 Presumably, this folder exists and is called "plt". If not, you've 
 got a more major problem.
 
 Once again, check that all of the following are true:
 
 1. There's no file named "environment" in your plt root.
 
 2. There _is_ a folder named "collects" in your plt root.
 
 3. The MrEd application, the MzScheme Application, and the DrScheme 
 application are in the plt root. (You can create aliases to these 
 applications in other locations, but make sure the applications 
 themselves are still in the plt root).
 
 If you don't understand any or all of these, describe to me the basic 
 setup of the files resulting from the expansion of the drscheme 
 distribution.
 
 HTH,

 Here is the actual state of play. (My guess yesterday was wrong on only
 1 item).
 
 >Once again, check that all of the following are true:

 Right.
 
 >2. There _is_ a folder named "collects" in your plt root.
 
 Right.
 
 >3. The MrEd application, the MzScheme Application, and the DrScheme
 >application are in the plt root. (You can create aliases to these

 They're all there. MrEd is there and OK, which is why I have been able to
 use it for the last 6 months. The other two are there with a small green
 decoration (abstract arrow?) towards the bottom of the icons, which I guess
 means "look somewhere else for material that they will need to use but that
 cannot be found". That's the effect (diagnostics etc.) when I try to operate
 them. I explained my experience in the last message that I sent last year.
 In brief, my experience was always that when something X was not present
 in some expected place Y and I found it via a global search in the system
 and moved it from wherever it was to Y, one of two things would then
 happen. If the first diagnostic said in effect "X is not in Y where it
 should be", then after I had moved X to Y, the next diagnostic would be
 "X' is not in Y' where it should be". Usually X' would not be X, and Y'
 would be =/= Y more often than it would be Y, The second thing that would
 happen was (fortunately?) a terminator for my searches. If the diagnostic
 said "X is not in Y ..." and I fixed that, the next try to run whatever
 application I was trying to run would give the diagnostic "X is not in
 Y ...", despite the fact that it was.
 
 There was never any situation where a "not where it should be" X could not
 be found somewhere - or at least something with the right name X. So.
 presumably all the pieces were present but their arrangement was scrambled,
 and sometimes putting something back in the place where it apparently was
 expected did not register with the part of the implementation that would
 need to call it or link to it.
 
 The actual process of loading the compressed material from your site and
 the unpacking all went automatically, with no fancy actions from me. In
 fact I didn't have any opportunity to act at all.  From the time that the
 loading started until the plt folder and its defective contents showed up on
 my machine, there was no prompt for me to do anything. Even the unpacking
 started automatically once the loading from your site was completed.
 
 I said that I had tried loading the implementation a second time when the
 first try did not produce something that worked. The reply to that, last
 year, was that the failings in the latest try may have been because there
 was some interference between the 2 versions loaded (even though I had
 disposed of all the folders etc. that I could see, for the first version),
 and therefore that it would be necessary to get rid of the first version
 before loading a second. My response to that was the defective behaviour
 was exactly the same for both versions, so that the guess about interference
 couuld not have applied to the first version. (That was the message for
 which I had no reply). It also occurs to me that, if that's still the
 recommendation for use of any future version, there is no reliable way for
 me to know that I have removed everything. Getting rid of the relevant visible
 folders and icons is not guaranteed to do it, given the sort of "scrambling"
 behaviour I have been seeing - and there are probably files which come with
 your implementation that can't be distinguished from pieces of MacOS 8.6 by
 their file names and can't be distinguished on contents when I have no software
 that will open them for me to look inside.
 
 The machine is a Powerbook G3 400 running MacOS 8.6. Everything fully
 standard, with no peculiarities that I have seen so far. I have no problems
 with any other software, either mine or imported.
 
 No hurry about suggestions of fixes, as I'll be turning the machine in for a
 repair in about 1/2 hour. As I may have mentioned yesterday, the fault is that
 the keys for 3, e, d and c usually stop producing any effect after random
 times in a session. Nothing related to Scheme, I'll bet. In England, fixes
 take arbitrary times, so I don't expect to get the machine back quickly.
 
 Is DrScheme standard w.r.t. some Scheme textbook, or is your version of the
 language (particularly I/O) specified reliably only in your DrScheme help or
 manual material? (which I can't read in the version I have got, because I get
 the same kinds of diagnostics that I have mentioned above, when I try).
 
 Thanks in advance for your comments - but no hurry, as I have said.
