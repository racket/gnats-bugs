>Description:
In the setup collection doc.txt, it says

  install-collection - a procedure that accepts a directory path
   argument (the path to the collection)

In fact, the argument is a file containing a module that 
provides a procedure that must be named `installer'.  Also, 
the argument to that procedure is the plt home directory,
not a path to the collection. 
>How-To-Repeat:
RTM.
