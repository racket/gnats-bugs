>Description:
printing values with sharing in quasiquote style results in
expressions that evaluate to errors instead of the printed value

Either shared should accept quasiquote style input, or shared
printing should not produce quasiquote style output.  (The first
is preferable.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Check "Show sharing in values" and Output style: Quasiquote
in the language dialog.
Enter:
(shared ([x (list y)]
         [y (list x)])
  x)
in the repl, which will evaluate to:
(shared ((-0- `((,-0-)))) -0-)
Evaluating this results in
Variable -0- referenced before definition or initialization
Evaluating this
(shared ((-0- (list (list -0-)))) -0-)
works, though.
