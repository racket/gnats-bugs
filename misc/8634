>Description:
The program below just shows me the module with no expansion and says that it is fully expanded. Printing out the result of expand, however, suggests that some expansion has been missed.

If I disable all macro hiding, I get steps back, but if I uncheck the "Hide library syntax" check box, I expected to see steps there, but I don't.

(require (lib "stepper.ss" "macro-debugger"))

(expand/step
 #'(module a mzscheme
     (require (lib "contract.ss"))
     (define-struct a (x))
     (provide/contract [struct a ([x number?])])))
