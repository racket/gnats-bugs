>Description:

I cannot run setup-plt when mzc is there and spidey is not there (ie the
standard bundle) becuase mzc's compilation apparently involves loading
spidey.

State-Changed-Why:
mzc and setup-plt no longer need mrspidey; compilation detects whether
spidey is installed, and skips spidey-specific files if it isn't
there.
