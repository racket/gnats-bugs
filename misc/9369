  (define/contract f 
    (natural-number/c . -> . natural-number/c) 
    add1)
  
  (map f '(1 2 3 4 foo)))

...produces the following error message:

8:7: 8:7 broke the contract 
  (-> natural-number/c natural-number/c)
on f; expected <natural-number/c>, given: foo

...where 8:7 is the reference to f in the call to map.  This seems wrong; didn't the symbol 'foo at 8:19 break the contract?  How is blame being assigned?

 I realize now that I misread the documentation on define/contract,
 viz. contract.ss:
 
   > The define/contract form treats individual definitions as units of
 blame. The definition itself is responsible for positive (co-variant)
 positions
   > of the contract and each reference to id (including those in the
 initial value expression) must meet the negative positions of the
 contract.
 
 So this isn't a bug, just a misunderstanding.

 Blame assignment for define/contract is at best confusing and at worst
 broken, depending on how you look at it.
 
 My advice: avoid define/contract. Instead, put your code in module and
 use provide/contract.
 
 If you've got more specific reasons to want something like
 define/contract, let me know and I might be able to give you more
 specific advice.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Tue, 03 Jun 2008 13:07:56 -0400
Reason>>> contracts


Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by asumu at Wed, 15 May 2013 21:50:06 -0400
Reason>>> The blame is not incorrect, but just confusing. In recent 
versions of Racket, the line that is blamed is slightly 
different. If it's still confusing, it can be handled in a 
separate bug.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Wed, 15 May 2013 21:50:06 -0400
Reason>>> Not a bug.

 Also, looking back over this PR, I see that it comes from a time before
 Stevie really got his hands on define/contract: I would not give the same
 advice about it now!
