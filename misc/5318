>Description:
I have written a procedure that counts the total number of embeded lists within a given list.
The procedure works fine IF I use DrScheme in "Beginning Scheme" language level but IF is run the procedure
in "Full Scheme" then it returns twice the number of lists embeded in the given list. Here's the code,
(define (count-embeded ls)
 (if (null? ls)
     0
     (if (list? (car ls))
         (+ 1 (count-embeded (cdr ls)) (count-embeded (car ls)))
        (count-embeded (cdr ls)))))

Please take a look at it and tell me whats wrong with it.

 Please provide the input data you used at each language level, so the
 problem can be verified.
