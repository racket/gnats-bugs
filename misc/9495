If I attempt to debug two modules simultaneously, I get:

other.ss:1:0: compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: << entire-module-body>>

(Perhaps this is related to the teachpack bug?)

; main.ss

(require "other.ss")

; other.ss

(define other-func add1)

Debug main.ss with other.ss open.

 I looked into this a bit, and I'm pretty confused.  The error occurs
 when the debugger tries to call 'expand' on the module's syntax
 object, but there aren't even any function applications in the
 module...
