>Description:
I was building Dr Scheme for 2 different platforms from the same location.

I expected it to be possible to make clean in the src directory then start again but  this didn't work until I deleted config.cache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Easy: build for 1 platform, make clean, then try to build for the other (if both can access the same file system).

 For multi-platform builds, I strongly recommend using separate build
 directories.
