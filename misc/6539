>Description:
I'm having problems using define/contract in a unit/sig e.g.

(module testmodule mzscheme
  (require (lib "unitsig.ss"))
  (require (lib "contract.ss"))
  (provide (all-defined))

  (define-signature test^ (foo))

  (define test@
    (unit/sig test^ (import)
      (define/contract foo (any? . -> . any?)
        (lambda (x) x))
      ) 
    )
  )

Give me an error :

   unit/sig: signature "test^" requires variable "foo" in: (unit/sig test^ ...

If I replace define/contract with a regular define, then there is no error. Is there 
something I need to do to use define/contract with units?

 Sadly, contracts do not yet cooperate with units.
 
 Stay tuned (but please breathe in the meantime :) there is a new unit
 system due out that will have better support for contracts.

(or maybe this is waiting for Matthew with some new unit
hacks? move if so...)
