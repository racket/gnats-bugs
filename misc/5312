>Description:
algol passes arguments as follows: 
 an expression with an LHS value denotes a thunk
 with two entry points (a getter and a setter)

 an expression without an LHS value denotes a plain 
 thunk; assignments inside of procedures that receive 
 don't work. 

i vaguely recall that some algols assigned to a non-existing 
variable (a temp variable). i don't think that this is proper. 



>How-To-Repeat:
begin 
 
 integer i; 
 
 procedure p(e); 
   real e; 
   e := 5; 
   
 p(i * i); 
 
 printnln(i); 
 
end

 The right thing is to reject a call where a non-variable is used in
 call-by-name slot, right?
 
 And that has to be a dynamic check in general?

 My recollection is this: 
 
  analyze whether a procedure parameter requires a left-hand side value
  in the procedure body. 
 
  if so, and there is a call to the procedure with an argument that doesn't 
  have a LHS value, then statically flag the program. 
 
  i don't think that there is a dynamic check involved.

 Procedures can be passed as arguments. The type of the argument is just
 "procedure".

 my algol 60 book doesn't cover that. it is something that pascal did do. 
 is it possible that you're confusing pascal and algol? are you using the
 report?

 in this case I think I am right. More specifically see 4.7.5.2 and note
 that the heading of the section is "Restrictions". From what I recall this
 implies "the compiler detects it."

 Yes, the report authors had some "obvious" type system in mind --- but
 it's undecideable, right?

 People didn't understand types well at the time. They just accepted it that
 some part of the translation process would check things and report errors. 
 
 I don't know about the second part. They may have had in mind an analysis
 that flags each parameter as "potentially mutable" therefore if
 "potentially called with a non-variable" reject. 
 
 It's fine by me if you do a dynamic check for now, just don't fail on the
 program with an arbitrary Scheme error message.
