 Are you sure that you have no leftover stuff, and that you have an
 updated version?  I'm trying the above with the nightly build and it
 works fine.

 So I'm going to assume that there is no bug?

 That's up to you.  I certainly didn't encounter the problem in the
 current builds, but if _I_ were you, I'd spend at least a little time
 trying to understand the behavior, because it's possible that the bug,
 in some form, is still present, and is merely masked by some change
 that went in after 371.
 
 If you'd like, I can get a guaranteed-clean version of 371 and see if
 it repros there.

 Well, a way to repliably reproduce it is a start.  I can't get this
 error on either svn or 371.

 Gah, I think it's pilot error once again; I too cannot repro it on a
 clean build of 371.  Sorry, folks.

 Like most people, I would like to use the words ''parameters''
