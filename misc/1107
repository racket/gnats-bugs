MS Windows 98
>Description:
Copy and Paste functions do not always work.  Often one must make several attempts for this basic text-editing feature to work.  Many times, only two characters of a line is copied.  In addition, it would be nice to use the left mouse button to bring up copy and paste features in many word processors.

 Dear Dimitry: version 52 is two generations behind the current DrScheme.
 The copy-and-paste bug was fixed a while back. Please take a look at 
 
     http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/
 
 If you wait till Wednesday, you can download version 100 (which is
 currently distributed as an alpha version). 
 
 We have repeatedly asked Berkeley to distribute to the new version or to
 point to our own Web page. To no avail. You may wish to tell your
 instructors about the problem.
