>Description:
Eric J. Wingler [wingler@math.ysu.edu] reports that in
DrScheme v202 on Windows 95, running the code

 (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" 8000)
 (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" 8001)
 (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" 8002)
 (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" 8003)
 (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" 8004)
 (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" 8005)

yields 6 pairs of ports.  Apparently, tcp-connect
succeeds even if there's no server on those 
ports.  This prevents Help Desk's port search 
mechanism from finding an unused port.

Not clear whether this is a Windows 95 problem or
something about Eric's installation.

 I can confirm this bug on my recently-installed Win95 box.
 
 Matthew, if you can think of a fix, I can try it out here.
 
 BTW, early copies of Win95 have no OpenGL, so I couldn't install
 DrScheme without first downloading that package.

 This problem is specific to "127.0.0.1"? (And/or "localhost"?)
