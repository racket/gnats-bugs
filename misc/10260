>Description:
If you are in DrScheme, and use the F1 key to jump to a help topic, and if your default browser is Internet Explorer, when IE opens, the resulting page displays an error which says your browser needs to support JavaScript.
>How-To-Repeat:
I just followed the instructions in:

http://docs.plt-scheme.org/quick/

When I got to the point where it suggested to move the caret to the function name and press F1, I did, and got the error message from the web site.

 What you see is an inherent problem in IE -- there is no way to
 convince it to run Javascript code from a local file unless you
 explicitly authorize it.
 
 You can look this IE "feature" up: search for "Local Machine Zone
 Lockdown".  The short version is that even though local files are at
 the most trusted IE security zone, they cannot run scripts without
 authorization -- it's a cheap way out instead of actually fixing the
 security issues.  For example, the scripts that run on the PLT
 documentation pages are completely harmless, and other browsers don't
 suffer from such a problem.

 Oh, alright. Well, I figured it likely was a problem with IE. I copy/pasted
 the URL from IE into Firefox, and was able to view the Help that way. I'm
 kind of surprised IE didn't popup a little error message saying that IE had
 blocked scripts from running on the page - I've seen that before with other
 locally stored files with JS/EcmaScript, and it usually gives me the option
 of allowing the scripts to run.
 
 For some reason, I didn't get that this time. Oh well. I'll go diving in the
 advanced settings and see if I can find a way to turn off that 'feature' in
 IE.
 
 Thank you, and sorry to bother you about this.

 Well, that sounds suspicious -- AFAIK, it *should* pop up that
 option.  Maybe you changed some setting somewhere?
 
 BTW, the whole thing is extremely annoying: it's possible to make a
 local web page that "asks" IE to treat it as coming from the Internet
 domain (and the restrictions on that are fine, as you can tell by the
 fact that docs.plt-scheme.org works fine) -- but the thing is that
 this requires adding some obnoxious comment to the html, and there is
 no way to do that for local files that are *not* html, and if that
 wasn't enough -- then links to such local-non-html files will not pop
 up a warning (about a link from one zone going to a higher one), and
 will not even pop up an error message -- it will just do nothing.
 Fun.
