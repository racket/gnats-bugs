Responsible-Changed-From-To: eli->nobody
Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 05:12:40 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 12:53:13 -0400
Reason>>> Closing

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 12:53:13 -0400
Reason>>> The first one seems like it is fixed.  For the second one,
either it was fixed, or there was a confusion between
match.ss and plt-match.ss -- there is now documentation for
(struct struct-name (...)) or for ($ ...), but not for the
one mentioned in this bug.
