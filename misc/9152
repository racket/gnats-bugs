>Description:
Windows XP Pro on my machine is configured such that the default action for files with a "HTML" extension is to open that file inside of the VIM text editor. As such, clicking on 'Help Desk' opens up index.html inside of VIM. What I think is supposed to happen is that it should open in a web browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
Windows XP Pro
DrScheme version 3.99.0.9-svn18jan2008 [3m].
1. Open any explorer windows.
2. Go to Tools->Folder Options->File Types->HTML.
3. Set it (or determine how) to edit files with VIM or something else.
4. Start DrScheme
5. Click on Help->Help Desk.

This would only happen for folks who have told Windows to open up html fils in an editor. For programmers this is too far fetched.

 My guess is that this is the desired behavior. If you want your OS to
 open html files in an editor, then that's what you get, no?
 
 DOn't all urls you open via the OS open that way?
 
 Or is there another setting somewhere else for the browser that's separate?

 So it sounds like DrScheme did what you asked (altho perhaps it shouldn't have).

 It seems to me that there are already too many places in Windows to
 set preferences that do related things and adding another one is the
 wrong direction. I don't use Windows that much so I may be wrong, tho.

 I'm having trouble seeing how we can do something better. AFAICT, you
 told windows that html files should open in an editor and then we told
 windows to open an html file for you.
 
 I think that duplicating the preferences information in drscheme is
 the wrong direction, but I'm still willing to be convinced if, say,
 others do that, or if it is common to set things up to open html files
 in editors or some other reason.

 I have been happy with the mac for many years and happier recently
 that I can fire up windows on it occasionally when I need to.

 The only other option would be the "external browser" approach where
 rather than telling the OS to open a file, you launch the web browser
 to open the file, and allow the user to choose which they prefer.

 Yes that is exactly what happened.

 I thought I was telling DrScheme to show me the help desk in a web
 browser though, not initiate an OS level "file open" operation.
 
 Now that I know how it works, it makes sense. Before that, it is confusing.

 The only time I double click on html files is to edit them, but that
 is just my machine. Am I representative of the majority of users who
 are using DrScheme? Probably not.

 BTW, that's actually what is still being used underneath, so you
 should be able to change the settings and make it use some custom
 browser instead of the default.  (Perhaps with Drscheme?  I don't
 remember if there was a preference entry that allows changing that.)
 
 BTW#2, do you have other software that distributes its documentation
 as html files?  If so, do you get into similar kinds of problems when
 you try to view these things?  If not, then it would be interesting to
 see how they start the browsing.  (Although I wouldn't be surprised if
 they just launch IE, ignoring any system preference...)

 Yes. Microsoft opens IE. IBM opens whatever browser is your 'default'.

 Is there some setting for "default browser"?  If so, then perhaps that
 should be used instead?

 There are two options:

 Not really -- there may be a difference between openning a simple url
 (uses `shell-execute'), and one that has a `#' in it (uses `ftype' to
 find the command line to run).

 Right-- that would be the way to add an option to DrScheme, too. I'm
 just questioning the wisdom of yet another configuration knob.

 Just to clarify: the "system default" in that IDE makes it use vi too
 for you right?  If so, then it looks like there is no problem.
 (Except, perhaps, for Robby to add a configuration item for tweaking
 it.)
 
 (BTW, I doubt that it's useful to have a configuration entry for
 something like that.)

 Indeed extraneous knobs serve no one. These two knobs are very specific though:
 
 Knob 1: Trust the operating system
 
 Knob 2: Trust the user

 Just to be sure I understand: you actually changed the way the system
 opens .html files intentionally selecting an editor instead of a
 browser, right? And there is actually a separate option that you could
 have changed to tell the OS how to open an html file for editing (as
 opposed to the "main" way of opening an html file) right?
 
 That doesn't sound like a common occurrence and it also sounds like
 something that isn't a good idea, and so that's why I'm hesitant to
 add another option to DrScheme to deal with that case.
 
 Have I misunderstood somewhere?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 To be totally forthcoming, my work computer is configured such that
 the file-system 'opens' html files in vi. I never open html files
 using a file system initated command unless I intend to modify them;
 'open' translates to double clicking on them or typing their name in a
 command shell. This is how I use my computer %100 of the time. When I
 want to view an html file on the file system I start
 firefox/opera/internet-explorer and open the file.

 Yes. I am doing something that totally goes against the grain of how
 the operating system should work.

 Microsoft Visual Studio and IBM Rational Application Developer haven't
 got a problem with this approach. IntelliJ Idea does have a problem
 with it, but it offers me a way, hence "trust the operating system or
 trust the user".
 
 Believe it or not, other than causing me to go on and on about this
 topic, this decision hasn't cause any problems so far! :)

 Yes. It went from a problem to a feature request.

 Hi Grant,
 Just wanted to let you know that the sendurl code changed
 significantly on Windows, and should probably work fine now, even if
 you set things up to open html files in an editor.  (I hope...  The
 code bypasses a small but pretty nasty bug in IE7.)
