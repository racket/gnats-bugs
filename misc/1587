>Description:
send-message-to-window doesn't send events correctly, depending on the
location of windows on the screen.
This problem was both on Linux and Windows - and the windows version gave
different errors sometimes.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run the small program below and move the window to the top-left corner of
the screen - watch the messages, then move the window by half of its size
to the right and down and see that messages are send only on its lower
right side.

#!/bin/sh
#|
exec mred -f "$0" "$@"
|#

(define (eprintf . args)
  (apply fprintf (current-error-port) args) (newline (current-error-port)))

(define main-frame
  (make-object
   (class frame% ()
     (override [on-close (lambda () (exit))]
               [on-message
                (lambda (m) (eprintf "main-frame-message: ~s" m))])
     (sequence (super-init "Foo" #f #f #f #f #f '())))))

(make-object (class canvas% ()
               (override
                [on-event
                 (lambda (e)
                   (send-message-to-window
                    (inexact->exact (send e get-x))
                    (inexact->exact (send e get-y))
                    (list (inexact->exact (send e get-x))
                          (inexact->exact (send e get-y)))))])
               (sequence (super-init main-frame)
                         (send this min-width  200)
                         (send this min-height 200))))

(send main-frame show #t)
(yield (make-semaphore))

 I believe the problem is that `send-message-to-window' wants positions
 in screen coordinates, not canvas client coodinates:
 
 (make-object (class canvas% ()
 	       (inherit client->screen)
                (override
                 [on-event
                  (lambda (e)
 		   (let-values ([(x y) (client->screen
 					(inexact->exact (send e get-x))
 					(inexact->exact (send e get-y)))])
 		     (send-message-to-window
 		      x y
 		      (list (inexact->exact (send e get-x))
 			    (inexact->exact (send e get-y))))))])
                (sequence (super-init main-frame)
                          (send this min-width  200)
                          (send this min-height 200))))
