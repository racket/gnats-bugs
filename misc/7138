>Description:
I'm trying to figure out how to pass a list of text segments to a command from within a file being preprocessed by mztext. Specifically, I am trying to implement a formatting command for vertical and horizontal boxes (vbox and hbox). I was trying for something like this.

@vbox {(align left)} {
    {One block of text}
    {Another block}
    @hbox {(align center)} {one} {two} {three}}
}
