>Description:
In the "Quick Start for a Test Drive" section, the following changes need to be made:

Step 8., editing handin-client/info.ss, there are more lines that need to be uncommented in info.ss now.

Between step 8 and step 9, there needs to be a step to run setup-plt.  Otherwise the handin tool does not get added and cannot be tested.
