>Description:
hi!

So i dont know if it's a bug or not but i havent found anything about it on the internet.
At the debug mode when i have a breakpoint if i "step" this open a new DrScheme window of the file that im at debug mode! this is very boring  make '"step" - ALT+TAB' to continue de debug... I'm using Windows Vista but at my laptop with same version of windows this not happens... can you help me?!

thanks

André
