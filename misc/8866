>Description:
This was reported by "Soeren D. Schulze" <soeren.d.schulze@gmx.de> on the Debian BTS.  His report:

Package: drscheme
Version: 1:352-5

The code

(require (lib "plot.ss" "plot"))
(plot (line (lambda (x) (expt 2 x))) (x-max 30) (y-max 1000))

draws a graph which looks like the intended exponential function from -5 to 11 on the X axis, but later goes down apparently linearly at 25 to 28, which is obviously not what an exponential graph should look like.

The lambda seems to return correct values, so there must be an error in the plot library.

I can reproduce this in a package version 370 too.  Oddly enough, I have also noted that this happens for y-max < 9392.

The points that are passed to the pl-plot-line function are apparently correct.  The error is probably on the C side, and this is getting a bit complex for me to fix for a low-priority bug.

 Right.  Try this:
 
   (plot (line (lambda (x) (expt 1.1 x)))
         (x-max 300)
         (y-max 10))
 
 and you'll see and even worse picture.  Also note that the line that
 goes down is a straight line -- which indicates that the problem is in
 the drawing code (in C) -- not dealing correctly with big integers (so
 you see a straight line going down to some really big negative
 number).  In both cases, setting a better y-max, like
 
   (plot (line (lambda (x) (expt 1.1 x)))
         (x-max 300)
         (y-max (expt 1.1 300)))
 
 shows a correct picture, which also makes it look that the plplot
 library is dealing fine with numbers (floating point numbers,
 probably) but messes up the drawing.
 
 Unfortunately, we don't have the resources to deal with bugs in the
 plplot code...  The plot library is in PLT in "minimal maintenance"
 mode -- a much better implementation would re-do the whole thing in
 Scheme...
