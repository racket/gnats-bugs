 This is on purpose:
 
  (error string obj obj) 
    displays string and then print each obj with a space separator
 
  (error src-symbol format-string obj ...)
    displays an error prefixed with src-symbol:, and passes
    format-string and the remaining objs on to printf
 
 The docs specify a bogus third form, (error string). In fact, this is
 a degerate form of the first case, and string is not prefixed with
 "error: ". I'll fix the docs.
 
 The different froms were invented to approximate different existing
 `error' forms in other Scheme. I prefer to leave them as-is because I
 have code using both.

 Actually, the docs are right, but difficult to understand. There
 is a third form:
   (error src-symbol)
 which prints "error: " concatenated onto src-symbol. This matches
 some other existing error convention.
 
 I'm revising the section.

 Ouch. I dont think that this convention is intuitive.

I'm pretty sure we use all three forms in our code, now.
