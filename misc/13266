>Description:
The documentation for `list-sort' from rnrs/sorting-6,
http://docs.racket-lang.org/r6rs-lib-std/r6rs-lib-Z-H-5.html,
says that `list-sort' is a stable sort.

However it's implemented in terms of Racket `sort', which isn't
a stable sort.

`list-sort' might be of dubious value anyway since it takes a
a mutable list. Maybe the fix should be a documentation
warning that `list-sort' isn't stable. Maybe it's not worth
doing even that.

 It is -- the docs say "The sort is stable" and then explain what that

 There was some off-list communication and this is confirmed as not-a-bug.
