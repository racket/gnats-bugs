>Description:
(= 1 #i1.0) is true in DrScheme
but when I use the test suite to 
compare #i1.0 (expression) and 1 (expected)
I get a cross and #i1.0 (actual)

This is unacceptable.

 You'll want to talk to the implementor of equal? (or use = as your
 comparison operator):
 
 > (equal? 1 #i1.0)
 #f
 
 > (= 1 #i1.0)
 #t
 
 This is not a test suite bug.

 Yes, I meant "exactness" but "correctness" is a nice Freudian slip :-)
 
 And yes, Will meant = is allowed to distinguish according to exactness.
 But what I am complaining about is that I don't understand the 
 motivation
 for not specifying (equal? any-number any-number) = (= any-number 
 any-number).
