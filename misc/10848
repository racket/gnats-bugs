When attempting 
mzscheme.exe -e '(display "hi\n") -i
(which is an example out of the PLT Guide)
I get
#f::1: read: expected a ')' to close a '('

other command lines such as
mzscheme.exe -e '(load "e:\\prgms\\scheme\\test_0001.ss")'
give the same error message

 That section uses syntax that is common in many shells, but on windows
 (eg, with cmd.exe) things are very different.  Specifically in the
 above case, cmd.exe doesn't consider a single quote as special, so
 when you run
 
   mzscheme.exe -e '(+ 1 2)'
 
 mzscheme receives four command-line arguments and the second is "'(+"
 which leads to the error you see.  (This should probably be mentioned
 in that page, but I didn't see a good place to do so.)
 
 It's sometimes possible to quote things with cmd.exe, for example:
 
   mzscheme -e "(display \"hi\nthere\n\")"
 
 but in general dealing with the cmd quoting rules involves a lot of
 pain.

 If you do have the energy to use the shell, you might consider
 installing cygwin or even to running linux on your machine. FWIW.

 Thanks for the tip.  Part of the problem is due to the way Windows
 cmd.exe processes the single and double quotes.<br>
 <br>
 The solution is to set environment variables for each argument and then
 call mzscheme.<br>
 <br>
 For example to execute<br>
 <br>
 <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">mzscheme.exe -r
 "e:\prgrms\scheme\test.ss"</font><br>
 <br>
 create a DOS batch file:<br>
 <br>
 <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">set dash_r=-r<br>
 set file_to_run=e:\prgrms\scheme\test.ss<br>
 mzscheme.exe %dash_r% %file_to_run%<br>
 </font><br>
 This will execute properly.  Note that the path has single backslashes
 not double backslashes.<br>
 <br>
 Thanks,<br>
 Dave<br>
 <br>
