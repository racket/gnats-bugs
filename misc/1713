 The manual displays fine for me from within IE 5.5 with Acrobat 4.0.
 
 What URL did you click on?

 Paul, I didn't use the IE plugin. I downloaded the file and tried
 to load it directly into Acrobat Reader. As I said, it didn't work.

 I tried that here, and it worked.
 
 What error message do you get?  Have you tried 
 loading other .PDF files recently?  Please try 
 another file and see if it loads.
 
 What version of Acrobat are you using?  Look 
 in "Help | About Acrobat Reader ...".  I'm
 using "Acrobat 4.0 0318 16:59".

 Strange. I use the same version, and all other pdf files from the DrScheme
 distribution load just fine. I'll try downloading a fresh copy first, and will
 let you know if it works.
 
 thanks so far,
 
 Ronald.

 I'm assuming this turned out OK, since the file appeared to be
 fine from here.  I'm closing the PR on that assumption.
