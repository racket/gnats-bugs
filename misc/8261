>Description:
The match macro duplicates some of its subterms, when
using the or pattern (and perhaps other patterns).

This leads to unacceptably bad performance at compile-time.

(Apologies if this is already known, but I didn't see
the PR go by)

One way to avoid this would be to thunk-up the rhs's and expand
into calls to those thunks.

Esp. now with the JIT, I guess that this would be
a viable strategy for all right-hand sides, regardless
of whether or not they are duplicated (but you may
want to double check that with Matthew).
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "match.ss"))

(syntax-object->datum
 (expand #'(match x
             [(or 'a 'b 'c 'd) '...a-big-expression...]
             [else #f])))

;; see four of the "big expression" appear in the
;; expansion of the above.

 I know about this, and I (with Ryan's help) have been working on a fix,
 but it's non-trivial.  However, it might get fixed soon.

 Are you taking the "thunk the rhs" approach, or doing something more
 sophisticated?
