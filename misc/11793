>Description:
Invalid XML numeric character references are not caught by the parser. They are treated the same as valid references; i.e. they are converted to numbers.

For example, &#160; is valid, and it becomes 160. This is correct.
&#0; is invalid by definition, but it becomes 0. This is incorrect.
