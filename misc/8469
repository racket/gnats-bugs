 A simpler example that still fails is:
 
 (require (lib "match.ss"))
 
 (define pattern '(number_1 . number_2))
 
 (match pattern
    [`(a)
     (printf "5\n")]
    [(? list?)
     (printf "shouldn't match\n")])
 
 
 
  > (syntax-object->datum
     (expand #'(match pattern
                 [`(a) (printf "a")]
                 [(? list?)
                  (printf "shouldn't match")])))
 
 <code where
   (let-values () (#%app (#%top . printf) (#%datum . "shouldn't match"))))
 appears twice>

 Thanks! Looks like no progress has been made on this PR, but I guess
 it should be a pretty simple fix. Maybe there's some deeper issue?

 Indeed, I haven't made progress on this PR.  Sorry about that.
 
 However, I don't believe this to be a simple fix.  Unfortunately, the
 problem here is that the 'optimizer' is thinking that some checks were
 already performed, when they in fact weren't.  The optimizer is hairy
 code that I didn't write, and don't fully understand.  So the fix may
 be simple, but the process to get to the fix wouldn't be.
 
 Sorry.

 I just took a quick look and the purpose statement on the function
 `in' in the file match-helper.ss made me think that the `and' clause
 on line 130 was suspicious.
 
 So, I took it out and Jen Axel's test seems to work now. I also ran
 match-test.ss in collects/tests/mzscheme and nothing failed.
 
 I checked in the change.
 
 I will leave it to you to extend the test suite with test cases. I
 hope you have time for that.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yeah, that optimization was clearly bad.

 Certainly.  Annoyingly, all of the test cases I've written are in
 Schemeunit, and thus aren't as easy for other people to run when they
 commit things.

 Oh, I didn't even know about those test cases! If the change I made
 breaks them, please undo it!
 
 Sorry,
