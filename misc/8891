>Description:
According to
http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-63/srfi-63.html
the following should work:
(require (lib "63.ss" "srfi"))
(A:fixN32b 4)

But typing this in DrScheme produces
18:3: top-level broke the contract 
  (case->
    (-> any)
    (-> (and/c exact? (integer-in 0 -1)) any))
on A:fixN32b; expected <(and/c exact? (integer-in 0 -1))>, given: 4

 Well, the contract system assigned the blame to you (you are the top  
 level). So technically it's your fault :-)
 
 At a min, this is an interesting case of a bad contract. -- Matthias
