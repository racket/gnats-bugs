>Description:
I believe that the guide has a mistake
on this page:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/language-collection.html

It provides the following commands for packing
a collection and installing it from packed file:

raco pack --collection literal.plt literal
raco setup literal.plt

None of those work on my Racket distribution.

The commands that work are:

raco pack --collect literal.plt literal
raco setup -A literal.plt
