>Description:
The installation instructions for the 208p1 patch
mention dragging the .plt file on the "Setup PLT"
application in the PLT folder; that application
doesn't exist on my installation.
(Only the bin/setup-plt shell script.)

Moreover, I always get confused by a "Finish
Install" app in the PLT folder, which displays
a serious-sounding error message.  (I know it isn't
really serious, but other users might get intimidated
by it.)

 Yes, we had a recent discussion on making setup plt be an application,
 and possibly merging its functionality with the finish-install thing.

 What is the serious-sounding error message?  (IIRC, it should tell you
 that you should use it only when the tree moved.)

 Pretending to be an average user, I don't really know what a "tree" is
 and why it should "move" of its own accord.

Reason>>> The problem with the error message is solved now.
Matthew -- I'm moving this to you if you know of any reason
why Setup PLT is not an application on OSX.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:37:25 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
