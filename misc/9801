Compare this with the results I get in the console window:

C:\>cd gjw_ds_phase4_dev

 Volume in drive C has no label.

 It doesn't surprise me that file-exists? and directory-exists? return  
 false... the paths p1 & p2 are relative paths, right? I would expect
 
 (directory-exists? (build-path p p2))
 
 to return #t.
 
 I wouldn't hazard a guess as to why the .dat file doesn't show up in  
 the console listing, though.
