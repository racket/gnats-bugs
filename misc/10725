>Description:
Hi all,

One of the Untypers found a bug in SRFI 19. The ~Y formatter in date->string doesn't pad years up to 4 digits:

  (date->string (string->date "01/02/0003" "~d/~m/~Y") "~d/~m/~Y")
  ; ==> "01/02/03" instead of "01/02/0003"

Patch and test case attached in "steps to reproduce". I'll send a bug report to the SRFI 19 maintainer at srfi.schemers.org as well.

Many thanks,

-- Dave

 Hmm... I went and took a look at this, and actually, it's not clear to =
 me that 0003 is actually the desired (a.k.a. documented) behavior.  My =
 copy of the SRFI-19 docs just has this to say:
 
 ~Y	year
 
 That is, it's not specified as being padded to 4 digits. =20
 
 For this reason, I'm tempted to leave it alone.  Is there a good reason =
 to have ~Y mean dates-padded-to-4-digits?
