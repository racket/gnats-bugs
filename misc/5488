>Description:
finddoc used to generate links with #name parts, to drill
down into the right location in a document.  It does not
seem to do that any longer, or perhaps the queries being
used in Help Desk are out-of-date.  In either case, the
user doesn't get sent to the right place in the target doc.
>How-To-Repeat:
For "constructor-style output", Help Desk generates a
MZSCHEME call equivalent to

((dynamic-require '(lib "finddoc.ss" "help") 'finddoc)
                    "drscheme"
                    "constructor-style output"
                    "foo")

This generates

<A href=\"file:<blah>plt\\collects\\doc\\drscheme\\drscheme-Z-H-2.html\">foo</A>

which is the right document, but the actual content is
somewhere in the middle.  Indeed, this is the same link
generated by the query

((dynamic-require '(lib "finddoc.ss" "help") 'finddoc)
                    "drscheme"
                    "quasiquote-style output"
                    "foo")

which is clearly undesirable.

 See the docs for `finddoc' and `findreldoc'.
