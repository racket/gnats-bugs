>Description:
The problem with bad ->* contracts pops up again and again.

I think this is an exhaustive list of procedures with ill-formed 
->* contracts:

- transplant-{in,out}put-port
- make-{in,out}put-port
- parse-command-line
- fold-files
- make-keyword-procedure
- make-deserialize-info
- make-require-transformer
- pin-line
- pin-{arrow,arrows}-line
- pin-{balloon,over,under}

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 15 May 2008 15:19:01 -0400
Reason>>> all corrected, finally
