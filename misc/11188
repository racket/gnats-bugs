   Indeed, match uses `var' as a pattern but the documentation does not=20
 mention this. You can use the `struct' form for now.
 
 (match (var 1)
    [(struct var (x)) x]))
 1
 
 The code from match is in collects/racket/match/private/parse.rkt:17
     [(var v)
       (identifier? #'v)
       (make-Var #'v)]

 Hmm, somehow this documentation seems to have been lost at some point.
  I'll fix that.
