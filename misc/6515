Dear Sir/Madam,

I work for the Computing Department at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.
Last year we included your software, Dr. Scheme, in a promotional CD for high school students.

We would like to include it in this year's edition as well. In order to do that,
 we need a written permission from your company. Email will suffice.

I hope you'd be willing to participate and thank you in advance.

If you were to participate, which is the newest/best version to include?


Yours truly,
Kate Krastev
