>Description:
I have an Ubuntu server (11.10) hosting a racket web server. The machine is also hosting a local Postgres database, which I am using the racket/db collection to access from the web server.

Everything works fine for a few days. Eventually any and all attempts to query from the racket web server generate the error "query-rows: connection is permanently locked due to a terminated thread". Once this error occurs, no access to the database can be made from then on.
