>Description:
Running this:

  (match 'foo [(list x x ...) 1] [else 2])

produces something like

  compile: unbound identifier (and no #%top syntax transformer
  is bound) in: x12

(This is a simplified version of a student error, probably thinking
that it's going to match `x' against a list of one or more items.)
