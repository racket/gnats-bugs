>Description:
In Internet Explorer, I can copy an image and paste it into DrScheme
as a value.

In Safari, I can copy an image and paste it into DrScheme as a value.

In Firefox, "copy an image" apparently means "copy the URL of an image",
so when I paste it into DrScheme, I get an error message.  In a way,
it's Firefox's problem, not yours, but it would still be a lot more
convenient for me and my students if copying and pasting an image from
a Web browser worked regardless of which browser you're using.

Obviously, DrScheme can tell the difference between a URL and a plain-old-string,
or it would blithely paste the characters of the URL rather than giving
me an error message.  So it should be possible for DrScheme to, when
it sees a URL of an image file being pasted, at least make an
attempt to retrieve the contents and use them as though an image
had been pasted directly.

 I can imagine some users being infuriated when trying to paste a URL- 
 like piece of text into DrScheme and having DrScheme try to look it  
 up (IIU your proposal correctly).  In general, I think this kind of  
 auto-go-to-the-net is a bad idea, and I would suggest that the right  
 way to deal with the problem is to get the behavior you want from  
 firefox instead.
 
 Also, I'd like to point out that this behavior is platform-reliable  
 at best; when I copy a picture from Firefox in OS X (by dragging to  
 highlight and then pasting in a terminal window), I get the alt text  
 rather than the URL.
 
 In fact, when I right-click on an image in Firefox (a.k.a. command- 
 click), I get separate "copy image" and "copy image location" menu  
 entries.  Perhaps this solves your problem right there?
