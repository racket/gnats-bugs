>Description:
When a constructor is used in the 'test-expr' position of a type-case in
PLAI, the coverage tester indicates that it's an untested piece of code. 
(see example below.)

The construction of the coverage tool means that this should probably be
reproducible in the core scheme language, and indeed the expansion of
type case is a totally straightforward use of "let", but I spent a few 
minutes trying to reproduce this without PLAI in the loop, and failed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this code in the PLAI language:

(define-type toy
  [airplane (lift number?) (name string?)])

(type-case toy (airplane 3412 "the bat!")
  [airplane (lift name) (+ lift 13)])

Note that the 'airplane' identifier in the type-case line is highlighted in 
red.
