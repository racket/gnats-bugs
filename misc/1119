 There is a preference that may help you here: if you haven't already, go
 to Preferences:General and check the box labelled:
 
 Enable Keybindings in Menus
 
 
 >The ReadMe file / Mac seems to be corrupted
 
 You're right.  I'll send you the content of that file.

State-Changed-Why:
I changed the name of the readme file from README.MAC to
readme-mac. It seems that the CVS client for the mac was automatically
assigning the file the PICT type, based on its name. This problem
could be a configuration problem, but I don't see how to fix it in the
client.  The other option would be to manually change the file type
before building the download bundles, but it's bound to be forgotten.
