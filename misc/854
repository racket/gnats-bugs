>Description:

If a file returns #f as it's result, require-file will not cache the result.

>How-To-Repeat:

create a file tmp.ss with these contents:

  (printf "loaded~n")
  #f

>Fix:

I would like to see a "hash-table-maps?" predicate added to the hash-table
primitive operations. It can be implemented like this:

(hash-table-maps? ht key) 
= 
(let/ec k
  (hash-table-get ht key (lambda () (k #f)))
  #t)

 Confusingly, require-file is unrelated to require-library:
 
  \scmutilsection{require-file}{filename}{syntax}
 
  Loads \var{filename} with \scm{load/use-compiled}. The only difference
  between \scm{require} and \scm{load/use-compiled} is that
  \scm{require} is a syntactic form where \var{filename} must be a
  syntactic string constant.
 
 There's no caching, regardless of the return value.

 Sorry!
 
 Why doesn't it cache?

 require-file was require was reference.
 
 reference was supposed to be the Spidey-friendly version of load.
