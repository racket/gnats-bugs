>Description:
I just wanted to send a great thanks to everyone who designed, and maintains doctor scheme. I use DrScheme in our Harvard CS51 class to do demos in class - I love the draw and image environment - we've done the "chaos game" and morphing/melding TFs (teaching Fellows) photos and all sort of other things.

Recently my laptop died (mac) and I bought a new mac (mac intel). It has been a painful process. 

But when it came time to reinstall DrScheme and see if last year's demos and code works - it took a mere 15 minutes!!! I cannot say how impressed I was and how thankful I am. This goes beyond the support I've seen for anythign else, and I'm sure its in part due to graet design. Now i can spend time thinking about what i want to say (in lecture) rather than tryign to install random software.

My many many thanks!!

I do have a few suggestions/request. These would make it possible to use DrScheme as the environment for all the students (we still sue emacs)

1. Make the teaching packs (draw and image at least) work with R5RS. They are the best! but I cannot use davanced student, i need R5RS

2. Make it possibel to redefine functiosn in the interpreter. That is a huge tool in exploration -- its very odd to have to do the load-compile-run type cycle just to see how variations in ideas would change things. I have always found that invaluable.


Thanks again!!

- a very grateful

 Have you looked at the world.ss teachpack? It's a replacement for draw.

 I just tested the world teachpack in DrScheme/R5RS with the following  
 line:
 
   (run-simulation 100 100 .1 (lambda (i) (circle (+ i 1) 'solid 'red)))
   ;; svn head
 
 and things work perfectly fine. So this actually works.
 
 What I don't understand is why you want to use R5RS?

 Again, if you are using R5RS, you can do this
 
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 369.6-svn25jan2007 [3m].
 Language: Standard (R5RS).
 Teachpack: /Users/matthias/plt/collects/teachpack/htdp/world.ss.

 Perhaps I misunderstand. But, since you're down the street from us,  
 I'd be more than happy to meet in person and discuss what we can do  
 to help you. I bet there is a coffee shop somewhere in the middle :-)
 
 I met with the Harvard faculty for a day and a half in 2002 to  
 outline a transition to a Scheme-based curriculum for beginners. I  
 knew it would be a huge uphill battle but as you can see from my web  
 page, I don't mind fighting windmills.
 
 See you around -- Matthias
