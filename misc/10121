>Description:
Sorry about the mistake in the my last email.
I believe the code I sent should "work" (run
and give the right answer) but it wasn't doing
what I thought. Here's the real deal

(Sorry -- I'm a bit new to this)


(define-values 
  (struct:clock  make-clock clock? clock-ref clock-set!)
  (make-struct-type 
         'clock     #f       1      0      'uninitialized      
          null      #f       #f     null   #f ))
(define clock-inst       (make-clock  0))

(define (put-clock! v)   (clock-set!  clock-inst 0 v))
(define (get-clock)      (clock-ref   clock-inst 0))

(define-syntax define-get/put-id
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(define-get/put-id id get put!) 
          (define-syntax id
           (syntax-id-rules (set!)
             [(set! id e)        (begin 
                                      (display (format "`id' (1)   it worked!~n"))
                                      (put! e))]
             [(id a (... ...))   (begin 
                                      (display (format "`id' (2)~n"))
                                      (get a (... ...)))]
             [id                 (begin 
                                      (display (format "`id' (3)~n"))
                                      (get))]
             ))
          ]))

(define-get/put-id clock get-clock put-clock!)

  (set! clock 123)
  (display (format "~s~n"  clock  ))
