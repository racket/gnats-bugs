 image=? and eq? are not the same thing (even on images). eq? tests 
 whether or not you have the same underlying object, not only if the 
 image's composition is the same.
 
 Let me make an analogy with books. Lets say that I give you two books 
 (first I give you one, you return it and then I give you a second and 
 you return it). You should now tell me whether or not the books are the 
 same. You have two strategies. Option 1: memorize the contents of the 
 first book and then compare with the contents of the second. Option 2: 
 make a mark with a black pen on page 17 of the first book. When you get 
 the second, check on page 17 for your mark.
 
 In the first case, you are comparing the contents of the books (ie, 
 it's structure) and in the second you are checking to see if you have 
 the exact same book or not. image=? is like the first and eq? is like 
 the second.
 
 As to why you would want the eq? variety, I think that I'll have to 
 defer that to later courses you may take.
 
 Hope that helps.
 
 I'm going to close this PR.
