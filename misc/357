>Environment:
MS Windows 95
>Description:
this may not be a bug, but when i'm browsing the documentation in a mr.ed window (from the help button in Dr.Scheme) when you press the grey arrow icons to navigate the doc it puts 5-10 tmp files in the windows/temp directory. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I noticed this after a couple of days i had 5500 tmp files (gulp) that took a few minutes to delete, it doesn't keep adding them more than once if you use the back or forward buttons but if you use the icons every time the page is visited new tmp files are added. this doesn't (pretty obvious i know) if i use iternet exploer to read the docs. I only mention it (aprt from the weirdness) because dr.scheme & mr.ed were crashing after about 20 mins of browsing the docs with them open, e.g 
'Mred.exe invalid page fault'. I can't seem to make them crash without using the doc windows.

 The 'img' problem has been fixed. For some reason, the code to delete
 temporary image files was commented out in version 50.

 Do you know whether MrEd is crashing because it runs out of memory?
 
 Thanks,

 That's certainly enough in principle. It may be that there is a bug in
 MrEd related to images that uses up memory. Or it may be crashing for
 some other reason (but I suspect that it's related to images at some
 level).
 
 Don't worry about trying to pin down the cause of the crash - I'm
 looking into it. But if you happen to notice anything specific about
 the problem in the future, I'd be happy to receive some hints. :)
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
