>Description:
`string->literal-regexp-string' has the case-sens? argument which is
probably useful to mention in the documentation (BTW, why not call it
regexp-quote as in Emacs?)

`string->literal-replace-string' is something that I'm not sure what it's
for (I didn't find any documentation or usage), but if it is supposed to
quote normal Scheme strings, then it should also backslash-quote double
quotes...

 Yes - fixed, thanks.

 Guess I haven't done enough Emacs programming. I'll change the name.

 It's supposed to create a literal for the 3rd argument of
 `regexp-replace'. The only special character for replacement strings is
 backslash.
