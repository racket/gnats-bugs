>Description:
I have spent a lot of time with the documentation and with the Dyvbig book.  I cannot find how to make indirect function (procedure) calls with Dr. Scheme.  I need to call short procedures or expressions (that operate on globals)in random order (specified by the pgm).  Normally I am accustomed to making a vector of pointers to functions that may be invoked by evaluating vector-ref.  If I use "eval" on the expressions (stored in the vector) the pgm takes a ridiculously long time - I need indirect function calling that is more efficient. (or I need to know how to do it...)  Thank you for any assistance.
