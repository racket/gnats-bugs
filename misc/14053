>Description:
plot: could not determine sensible plot bounds; got x ∈ [1,1], y ∈ [2,3]

Plot could choose some % bounds (or a fixed value) by default.

E.g. in the case below, choose (x +-1) or (x +- .1 * x).
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require plot)

(plot (points (list (list 1 2) (list 1 3)))

produces the following output when run in drracket

plot: could not determine sensible plot bounds; got x ∈ [1,1], y ∈ [2,3]
