>Description:
The manual for the XML library gives the wrong signature for eliminate-whitespace.  The docs say

    (eliminate-whitespace tags choose elem) â†’ element?
      tags : (listof symbol?)
      choose : (boolean? . -> . any/c)
      elem : element?

whereas the implementation is curried in the last argument:

    ((eliminate-whitespace tags choose) elem)

where the contracts for the three arguments and for the final result are as above.
