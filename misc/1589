>Description:
the draw.ss teachpack says that the clear- versions of
the functions consume the same inputs as the draw- versions
but they don't.

FWIW, I think that listing all of the functions would be clearer.

 Robby, the clear- functions consume an optional color argument that I throw
 away. I do this so that I can abstract over clear-/draw- functions. 
 
 Are you refering to something else?

 No, that's what I'm referring to. I didn't realize that the final
 argument was permitted. In any case, it is still not the same (and I
 don't think that allowing the extra argument is a good idea. Seems like
 a hack).
 
 How does your abstraction work? You must be duplicating the code of the
 lambda becuase draw-circle and clear-circle have different names (ie,
 typing "draw-circle" in to the reply results in "draw-circle" and
 typing "clear-circle" into the repl results in "clear-circle"), right?

 The abstraction concerns USES of draw- and clear- not the internal
 abstraction. It's wired into the book. Sorry.

 I hate to be a stick in the mud, but the docs *are still wrong*.

 The docs claim that the clear- operations accept the same
 arguments as the draw- ones, but the clear- ones do not have to take
 the final argument.

 Both functions consume optional color arguments. The draw- functions use
 BLACK as default. -- Matthias
