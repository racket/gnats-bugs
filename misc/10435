>Description:
Please see the code below,
(require test-engine/scheme-tests)

(define a 'b)
(check-expect (eq? a 'b) #f) ; a = 'c, wrong?
(check-expect (eq? a 'c) #t)
(set! a 'c)
(check-expect (eq? a 'c) #t)

;; run all tests
(test)
>How-To-Repeat:
Please see the code.
>Fix:
This behavior is to be expected: The tests are run by the `test' function, by which time the `set!' form has only run.  I've clarified the documentation to that effect.
