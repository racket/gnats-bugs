>Description:
Dave B spotted two bugs in SRFI 19 today:

  - time>=? is incorrect on line 393
  - time<=? is incorrect on line 399

The {greater,less}-than-or-equal operators on these lines should be plain old {greater,less}-thans.

I've uploaded a fix to time.ss here:
    http://www.untyped.com/downloads/srfi19/time.ss

I've also updated the unit tests here:
    http://www.untyped.com/downloads/srfi19/tests.ss

Finally, I've put the diffs (from "svn diff") here:
    http://www.untyped.com/downloads/srfi19/diffs.txt

I reformatted tests.ss in the newer #lang style so the diffs are quite long.

Hope this helps,

-- Dave
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

(require srfi/19)

(time<=? (make-time time-utc 2 1) (make-time time-utc 1 1))
(time>=? (make-time time-utc 1 1) (make-time time-utc 2 1))

 This looks safe enough to include in 4.2.3, any objections?
 
 (I'll leave the test suite revision to John.)

 Done.  Dave, you lost an earlier fix of mine; it turns out that your  
 string->date tests only work when run on a machine in GMT. All fixed  
 now, and thanks for the patch.
