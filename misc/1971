>Description:
I'm working on Linux-gnu, version Red Hat 6.2.   I reported a few days
ago that I couldn't run DrScheme v 103.   But now I can!  What I did
to fix things was to dowload 101 & install it & run it.   That somehow
makes it possible for 103 to run.  Strange.  I'll try to isolate a bug
report.  Netscape might be part of the problem as well.  

Anyway, I like 103, it's a big improvement.  

(poincare)plt> uname -a
Linux poincare 2.2.16-3 #1 Mon Jun 19 18:10:14 EDT 2000 i686 unknown

I went to 

http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/download.html

and downloaded binary Linux (ELF), both versions 103 and 101.  (I also
successfully compiled the Linux version, but that's not important for
this story.)

No version had any trouble compiling or installing.  I always made the
.zo files:

 Create .zo files now (y/n)? [y] y

>How-To-Repeat:
I'll work on it!  Just  want to say that the
problem is random or spurious.
