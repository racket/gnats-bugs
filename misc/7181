When I run the setup-plt script on RedHat Enterprise Linux, I get the following errors regarding fit-low-level.c.

larch 1012$ setup-plt

Is this a problem?  I didn't notice it happening under Windows.

 There are some problems with the 20x version of plot.  It shouldn't be
 a problem if you're installing using the binary package or if you're
 compiling from scratch.  In any case, the build script for that part
 was completely re-written in v299, so I'm closing this bug.
