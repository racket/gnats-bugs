>Description:
Section "3.2 Modules" in the Dracula reference manual does not make clear the restriction on the order of names in the list of modules. It says "the export must come before the import to prevent cyclic dependencies", but it's not clear that this is referring to the list of modules, since lists of import interfaces and export interfaces may also be involved.
