>Description:
mzscheme -qmvL xml.ss xml -e '(read-xml (open-input-string "<a></a>"))'
string-set!: expects type <character> as 3rd argument, given: #<eof>; other arguments were: "\0" 0

>How-To-Repeat:
execute this program:

(require (lib "xml.ss" "xml"))
(read-xml (open-input-string "<a></a>"))

get this result:

string-set!: expects type <character> as 3rd argument, given: #<eof>; other arguments were: "\0" 0

The string-set! in question is 

  plt/collects/xml/private/reader.ss:373:24: (string-set! s 0 c)
