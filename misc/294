When I choose "print interactions" or "print definitions" , the type-face the printer prints in is SOOOOO huge.

I've already tried changing the default font size.  That didn't help.

How do I fix this??
Thanks.

 Just to be sure, you did restart DrScheme after changing the font
 size, right?
 
 I'm not sure why the printing font size wouldn't change with the
 screen size. There is another way to print if you have a way to
 directly print PostScript files. In the preferences dialog, you can
 turn on an option that causes "Print.." to ask whether you want to
 print to PostScript or using the Normal printing. If you choose
 PostScript, you can set an explcit scale for the output.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

Windows printing has a scale setting accessible via the "Properties"
button in the print dialog. I think this is what she used to fix
the problem.
