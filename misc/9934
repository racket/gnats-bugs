>Description:
The documentation for pin-arrow-line suggests that its 'src' and 'dest' arguments can be pict-paths rather than picts, but the contract on pin-arrow-over prevents this. I'm interested to see that it's the library file that's blamed for this.  Maybe an internal contract mismatch?
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang slideshow

  (define dot (disk 15))
  (define (step) (cc-superimpose (blank 200 200) dot))
  (define s1 (step))
  (define s2 (step))
  (define both-pict (hc-append s1 s2))
  (let-values ([(x y) (cc-find both-pict (list s1 dot))])
    (printf "x: ~a y: ~a\n" x y))
  (define with-arrow (pin-arrow-line 3 
                                     both-pict
                                     (list s1 dot)
                                     cc-find
                                     (list s2 dot)
                                     cc-find))

=> 

x: 99 y: 101
. (file "/Users/clements/plt/collects/slideshow/pict.ss") broke the contract
