 DrScheme uses exact arithmetic for rational numbers. So, instead of 
 approximating 5/6 with 0.83, it just leaves it as 5/6.
 
 That said, you may still be interested in the decimal expansion of 
 5/6. You can either use inexact->exact:
 
    > (exact->inexact 5/6)
    0.8333333333333334
 
 which prints in decimal form, since DrScheme always prints inexact 
 numbers in decimal form. Be careful with that, tho, since it will 
 introduce imprecision into your calculations. Just use it when you 
 are done calculating.
 
 Or, if you want to know the digits for some other reason, you might 
 calculate them:
 
 ;; nth-digit : number number -> number
 ;; calculates the nth digit behind the decimal place
 ;; in the decimal expansion of number
 (define (nth-digit number digit)
   (modulo (floor (* number (expt 10 digit))) 10))
 
 Hope that helps.

 Be careful of that way -- when you write:
 
    5.
 
 you are telling to drscheme to treat 5 as an inexact number so the 
 entire computation is inexact, which means that your result might not 
 be right. It may not matter for what you are doing, but in general it 
 is better to apply the inexactness at the very end.
