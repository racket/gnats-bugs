It sounds like something is going wrong with the .zo build. Does DrScheme
work right if you install without building .zos?

The installer doesn't currently know how to make sure the .zos were
built correctly. There may have been an error that wasn't reported (or
at least not reported long enough for you to read it). After you have
installed (with or without .zos), please open a command shell, go to
the directory where DrScheme is installed, and run:
  > "setup plt" -c
(The -c flag deletes all existing .zo files and tried to build them
again.)  What are the last few lines of the output?

 Quoting Federico Hernandez-Pueschel:
 > c:\develop\scheme\plt>"Setup PLT.exe" -c
 > PLT home directory is C:\DEVELOP\SCHEME\PLT
 > Making .zos for MrEd Collection at C:\DEVELOP\SCHEME\PLT\collects\mred
 > Making .zos for zodiac at C:\DEVELOP\SCHEME\PLT\collects\zodiac
 > Making .zos for MzLib at C:\DEVELOP\SCHEME\PLT\collects\mzlib
 > Making .zos for mzc at C:\DEVELOP\SCHEME\PLT\collects\compiler
 > reference to undefined identifier: define-argument-list
 
 I'm still stumped. If you have time, let's get more information.
 Try
   > "Setup PLT.exe" -cv
 
 Thanks,

 I am unable to reproduce your bug here on our windows machines. Perhaps the 
 install that you downloaded is corrupt? Maybe you can try re-installing it?

 I have not figured out the installation problem.
 
 Is is possible that filenames on your filesystem get truncated to 8.3?
 That would explain the results, but I can't explain why filenames
 would get truncated.
 
 Here is a test, just to be sure. Run this in MzScheme:
 
  > (close-output-port (open-output-file "abcdefghi.ss"))
  > (open-input-file "abcdefgh.ss")
  open-input-file: cannot open input file: "abcdefgh.ss" in directory "D:\ProgramFiles\PLT" (2)
 
 and this:
 
  > (close-output-port (open-output-file "jklmnopq.ss"))
  > (open-input-file "jklmnopqr.ss")
  open-input-file: cannot open input file: "jklmnopqr.ss" in directory "D:\Program Files\PLT" (2)
 
 If you don't get the right error messages as above, then at least
 I'll have a clue.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

The first one didn't get an error. This is an intractable machine/OS
