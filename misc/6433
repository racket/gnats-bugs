>Description:
I recently wrote a function which has a signature like

  (listof (gen A) (gen B) ...) -> gen (listof A B ...)

where gen A :: (integer? . -> . (integer? . -> . a?))
but I couldn't come up with a contract for the left hand
side of the function because listof only takes flat-contracts.
Could listof be made to take function contracts as well?

 Sadly, the theory behind the contracts does not yet support such
 contracts (well, in principle it could, but only for immutable lists).
 Figuring out how to fix this is something I'd quite like to do.

State-Changed-Why:
    added listof-immutable/c (and friends) that
    you can use. Note that using mutable lists with
    such contracts is not something I know how to
    do yet.
