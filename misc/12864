 The builds that make up our installers use `--disable-libffi' to avoid
 depending on a system libffi, and indeed ldd on the ubuntu executable
 shows me this:
 
         linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0x00b0f000)
         libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x4bf0f000)
         libm.so.6 => /lib/i686/nosegneg/libm.so.6 (0x4bf21000)
         libpthread.so.0 => /lib/i686/nosegneg/libpthread.so.0 (0x00f63000)
         libc.so.6 => /lib/i686/nosegneg/libc.so.6 (0x00196000)
         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x4bd45000)
 
 Perhaps you had a previously built binary?  (Even if so, I don't see
 how the installer would run it instead of the one it installs.)
