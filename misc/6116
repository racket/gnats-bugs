>Description:
One more regular expression bug:

The Quantifier test from the Perl regular expression test  data causes DrScheme/MzScheme to go into a hard loop, sucking up 90% of the CPU.

Test Case:

/((a{0,5}){0,5}){0,5}[c]/
>How-To-Repeat:
1.  Require the pregexp library.
2.  (define exp (pregexp "((a{0,5}){0,5}){0,5}[c]"))
3.  (pregexp-match exp "aaaaaaaaaac")

System will grind to a halt.

Reason>>>  I couldn't duplicate the bug.  I didn't see any combinatorial
explosion (and my PC is pretty modest).  The suggested example returned
with the correct answer near-instantaneously.

 I can't recreate it on PLT 299 (Mac OS X) either.  I'll try on a 
 Windows system just to be sure.

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 26 Apr 2005 19:15:28 -0400
Reason>>> Seems like there is no bug now, tell me if this changes and
I will re-open.
