>Description:
The program below seems to loop forever.

I think the problem is that define-splicing-syntax-class defines a head pattern, but I'm using it in a context that expects an ellipsis-head pattern. If that's the case, it would be nice for this to be an error.

It would be even nicer if this could be made to work. I have several macros that accept the same keyword arguments, and I'd like to a define syntax class for each keyword argument, to avoid repeating its definition in each of the macros.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

(require (for-syntax syntax/parse))

(define-syntax (m stx)
  (define-splicing-syntax-class x-kw
    (pattern
     (~optional (~seq #:x x) #:defaults ([x #''no-x]))))
  (syntax-parse stx
    [(_ (~or x:x-kw
             (~optional (~seq #:y y) #:defaults ([y #''no-y])))
        ...)
     #'y]))
