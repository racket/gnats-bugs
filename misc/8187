>Description:
I put a .plt file on my Web server with the latest edition of the "tiles" teachpack.  When I try to install it by typing in a URL, I get error messages like "gnu-unzip: bad header" and "not an unpackable distribution archive".  The exact same .plt file installs perfectly well if I download it and install it by browsing to its location in the local filesystem.  It also installs perfectly well over the Web (as well as locally) in version 350.

 This is a result of the same bug that prevented getting manuals
 installed, which I fixed a few days ago.  It's one of the reasons that
 we'll have a v352 out very soon (in a day or so).
 
 (BTW, note that your .plt gets installed in the plt tree, in the
 `teachpack' directory that no longer exists.)
