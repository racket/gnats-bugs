 Teachpacks work only at the Teaching Levels of DrScheme, that is, Beginning
 Student, Intermediate Student, and Advanced Student. 
 
 So, 
 
 1. Set the language level to Beginning Student. 
 
 2. Type 
 
  > (start 100 100)
  > (draw-circle (make-posn 50 50) 50 RED)
 
 in the Interactions window.

 Another thing to make sure is that you clicked execute after setting the
 teachpack. The interactions window should have a line saying that the
 teachpack was sucessfully installed. Did you see that?
