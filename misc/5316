 After you uninstalled, were there any files left in your PLT directory
 (usually "C:\Program Files\PLT")?  You might want to drag that directory
 to the Recycle Bin from Windows Explorer.
 
 Also, you might want to try redownloading the install file.  It's
 possible that it's corrupted.

 Stephane,
 
 	All the files are installed to the PLT directory.  However,
 DrScheme creates a file mred.pre, as follows:
 
 	Under Windows, if the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment
 variables 
 	are defined, preferences are stored in 
 	%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\mred.pre, otherwise preferences are
 stored 
 	in mred.pre in the directory containing the MrEd executable.
 
 	Windows NT: When DrScheme is launched under Windows NT and 
 	HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are not set, NT automatically sets the 
 	variables to indicate the root directory of the main disk.
 Therefore, when HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are not set in NT, the
 preferences file mred.pre is saved in the root directory.
 
 Use Find to find mred.pre, and delete it.  Does that help?
 
 	Oui, je parle francais un petit peu, mais pas couramment.

 Stephane,
 
 	We haven't yet added it to the FAQ, since it hasn't been
 frequently asked :-)
 
 	But it's a good candidate for inclusion.
 
 	De rien ...
