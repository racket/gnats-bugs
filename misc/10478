Using the srfi/78 "check" macro with the eopl language level gets "bad syntax" error.  

In the example below, change the language to "scheme" and everything works fine.

(module foo 
  (lib "eopl.ss" "eopl")

 The problem is that `=>' is an identifier that is provided from the
 scheme language.  A proper solution (which is not a good idea to do
 quickly) is to switch the plai language to be based on `scheme/base'
 instead of the legacy `mzscheme'.
 
 A way to try to bypass it is to grab `=>' from the scheme language:
 
    (module foo eopl/eopl
      (require srfi/78 (only scheme =>))
      (check 3 => 3))
 
 This will work, but will interfere with the usual use of `=>' if you
 need it:
 
    (module foo eopl/eopl
      (write (cond [1 => values]))
      (require srfi/78 (only scheme =>))
      (check 3 => 3))
 
 If you do need it, then you can rename `scheme's arrow:
 
    (module foo eopl/eopl
      (write (cond [1 => values]))
      (require srfi/78 (rename scheme ==> =>))
      (check 3 ==> 3))
