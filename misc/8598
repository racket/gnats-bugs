>Description:
Whenever the address of the Free Software Foundation is mentioned in the  copyright headers of source files (for example, in mzscheme/main.c), it is wrong. The Free Software Foundation has moved at least twice since the address listed.

The FSF's current correct address is:

Free Software Foundation
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
Boston, MA 02110-1301
USA

Cheers,
Christine
