Human Language: english
>Description:
In the MzScheme manual, there's a section 

  MrEd, DrScheme, and mzc

In the corresponding entry in the hdindex generated for the 
manual, the space before "mzc" is elided.  So Help Desk
searches that find this entry have a link that looks like

  MrEd, DrScheme, andmzc

This is presumably an error in the code that generates 
the hdindex file.

>How-To-Repeat:
Do a Help Desk search on "MrEd"
