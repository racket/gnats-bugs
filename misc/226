>Description:
I analyzed a file that contains: 

;; Driver:
(define (Eval expr)
  (reset expr)
  (let stepper ()
    (if (final-state? =control= =context=)
	(unload =control= =env= =context=)
	(begin
	  (step =control= =env= =context=)
	  (stepper)))))

I had an arrow from stepper pointing to the north-west corner of the
screen, no matter how large I made the screen.
