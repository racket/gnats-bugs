>Description:
I've had two students report seeing this error from the handin server (it isn't clear if this error is on the client or the server side):

submit error: queue-callback: eventspace is shutdown: (eventspace #<thread:...-server/main.rkt:616:14> #<procedure:...common/queue.rkt:259:34> '#hasheq() #<semaphore-peek> #t #<semaphore> 0 '#hash() 0)

Both students have had comment boxes in their code but, of course, a simple example with a comment box does not trigger this problem for me.

I'm using a version of the handin-server from about 1 month ago, tho, so if upgrading might help, I will try that (and you have my apologies)

 The handin server has nothing to do with it, it's coming from the
 sandboxed evaluation.  But the sandbox code is also doing nothing with
 eventspaces except for creating it.

 In that case it's probably some gr2-related problem -- maybe there was
 some gr crash somewhere, which caused the eventspace to go down?  Are
 there any other problems in the log before that happens?  It's also
 worth looking at the terminal that runs it, in case there's some
 errors at a level that is not caught and redirected to the log file.
 
 Also, if I'm right and it's a gr2 problem, then it's probably good to
 upgrade.

 This "gr2 changes are probably the root of all bugs" rationale seems
 pretty weak; it just looks an ordinary synchronization bug to me.
 
 Anyways, I still upgraded and now when I start my server I get the
 transcript below (the error appears when I try to submit the
 assignment I had just submitted successfully before the upgrade).

 So it looks like upgrading is unwise and I'll now go downgrade.

 That was not the rationale.  It was:
 
 * This is unlikely to be related to the handin server, since that just
   hands off the evaluation to a sandbox.  (It *might* be somewhat
   related if that evaluation is trying to do some gui thing in a way
   that fails, but usually it should avoid any gui-ness.)
 
 * It is unlikely related to the sandbox itself, since it does very
   little with eventspaces.  In addition, the code that deals with that
   didn't change in ages.  Again, it might be that something in the way
   these things should be handled has changed in some way that breaks
   what it does now.
 
 
 > it just looks an ordinary synchronization bug to me.
 
 It definitely looks like that -- some kind of probably-gui
 synchronization, and there's very little of it in the sandbox.
 
 In any case, I'm really not trying to push it aside -- I'd definitely
 try to find what causes it, but I really need some way to make it
 break to do any kind of debugging.

 This is unrelated -- I'll try to see what breaks it later tonight.
 But IIRC, just starting the server is unlikely to lead to reading
 preferences -- do you get that error with just a bare server?

 Sorry -- not just starting it. I handed something in and got the error.

 Chiming in late: I've had one student team report this problem as well, several weeks ago. The only additional information I can add is that this team saw this error repeatedly, and no one else did, leading me to believe (maybe not so surprising) that it had something to do with their code. Ditto on not having tried to upgrade. Think I'll hold off now :).

 Yes, I should have said this. When it happens to a team, that team's
 ability to handin appears to be wedged.
