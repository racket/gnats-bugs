>Description:
The key event stream returned by sending get-key-events to a fr-text-field% seems to contain each expected event twice. See example.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require frtime/gui/fred)

(define frame (new ft-frame% 
                   [label "Example"]
                   [min-width 640]
                   [shown #t]))

(define input (new ft-text-field% 
                   [parent frame]))
(define returns ((send input get-key-events) 'release))

(define (count-e event)
  (accum-b (map-e (lambda (_) add1)
                  event)
           0))

(count-e returns)

;; Start typing. The count should be incremented twice for each key release.
