>Description:
If a slatex file main.tex has

\input{a}

and a.tex contains

\scheme|(+ 1 2)|

Then the generated file has a name of the form .ZNmain.tex

Instead, it should be .ZNa.tex.  This would reduce the proliferation of numbers, and make error messages easier to understand.

 I think there is an option that will do that.
 
 Also, I think you're not going to get any more changes to slatex. Its
 been frozen for at least a decade. :)
