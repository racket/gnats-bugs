>Description:
Interactions window flickers as it jumps between parts that need to be redisplayed.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the interactions window of FrTime:

Type seconds at the interactions window.
Keep typing various things until the seconds scrolls off the screen.  At this point, you'll see the window pop back to the seconds interaction with each update.  Now type seconds again at the interactions window.  You'll see the interactions window flicker wildly as it pops back and forth to both sites of update.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
From: greg@cs.brown.edu

This only happens in recent versions, where FrTime uses editor-snip% objects to render behaviors.  I don't know how to make changes to those snips without having the interactions window jump around.

 I am not capable of fixing this PR without input from one of you. I
 don't understand what is making the snip get focus, so I don't know
 how to turn it off. The relevant code is
 
 https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/master/collects/frtime/frp-snip.rkt
 
 With a little bit of direction, I'd be happy to learn more, but I'm pretty lost

 Is it the call to needs-update that's triggering the scrolling? If so,
 then probably the API would have to be extended. (I think there's not
 another way to do that, but I'm not sure.)

 I don't know what is causing the scrolling. In my opinion, if the API
 already doesn't support this, it probably isn't worth fixing. Do you
 agree?

 Oh, I don't know. It might be easy.
 
 The bug itself doesn't seem like too high of a priority, tho.

 Do you mind if I move it to your infinitely long list from mine? I
 agree that it isn't very high priority, but don't want to totally
 forget it, but don't want it on my list when I don't really have the
 ability to fix it.

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by jay at Thu, 23 Feb 2012 16:18:31 -0500
Reason>>> The GUI API appears to need to change before this can be
fixed and it doesn't seem to urgent, since it only comes up
on these one line situations.
