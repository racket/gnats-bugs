>Description:
I figured out how to link to the bundled documentation for "image", but not the bundled documentation for "universe".  But there were enough little differences sprinkled around throughout "universe" that I copied "universe.scrbl" into my package and edited all the changes into it, rather than trying to link to the bundled version.

And I've got @deftech and @tech working correctly, with the latter hotlinking to the former.

But I can't get @defproc and @scheme doing the same.  More specifically, anything that is @defproc'ed in the DrScheme download bundle shows up as a hotlink when I mention it in a @scheme tag, but anything that's @defproc'ed in one of my files (even a file I copied from the download bundle, like universe.ss) isn't underlined where it appears in either a @defproc or a @scheme, and the latter is NOT a hotlink.  The name in the @defproc has a mouse-over that shows correctly the .ss file that provided it.

Maybe I shouldn't worry about this, but it's a nagging annoyance that should have a simple solution.

Oh, by the way, all of this is in a directory that I package using "planet create", and then install locally using "planet fileinject".  I've tried this procedure in both 4.2.2 and 4.2.3.

Attached is a simple example file.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scribble/doc
@(require scribble/manual
    (for-label scheme
    	       ; "picturing-programs.ss"
               ; "io-stuff.ss"
               ; "sb-universe.ss"
               ; "tiles.ss"
	       ; teachpack/htdp/image
	       ; teachpack/2htdp/universe
               ; (only-in lang/htdp-beginner check-expect)
               ))

@; teachpack["picturing-programs"]{Picturing Programs}
@title{Picturing Programs Teachpack}
@author{Stephen Bloch}

@defmodule["picturing-programs.ss"]
@; Also tried @defmodule[(planet sbloch/picturing-programs)] and @defmodule[(planet sbloch/picturing-programs/picturing-programs)] with the same results.

@section{About This Teachpack}

@defproc[(foo [bar number?]) number?]{ Does nothing.}

Blah blah @scheme[sqrt] blah @scheme{sqrt} blah @scheme[(sqrt 3)] blah @scheme{(sqrt 3)}
The first and third of these (the ones in square brackets) show up correctly as hotlinks.

Blah blah @scheme[foo] blah @scheme{foo} blah @scheme[(foo 3)] blah @scheme{(foo 4)}
None of these show up as hotlinks.

 Never mind; I think I've got it.  Close this.
