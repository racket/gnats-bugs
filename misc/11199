>Description:
I got some contract violations to a program.  Unfortunately, the popup window with these violations showed up in the background, so I never saw it appear.  I was quite happy to have gotten my contracts right, and went back to working on my lecture.  It was several minutes later, while flipping around windows, that I neve noticed its presence.

 I believe Kathy has also fixed this one since 5.0.1.
