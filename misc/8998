>Description:
The end-of-time type spec in the Animated images section says that it takes an argument (which is seems to do when you try to run it), but the example invocation doesn't show an argument.
>How-To-Repeat:
find docs for: end-of-time
click Animated images
See this:
* end-of-time : String u Symbol -> World
When DrScheme evaluates (end-of-time), it stops the clock and displays the given string or symbol; no further tick events, key events, or redraw events take place until the world is created again.
