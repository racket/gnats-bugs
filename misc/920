>Description:
when setting up the tests collection, the function str-list->dos-str is
called with the argument:

 ("-aqge-" "(require-library \"framework-test-engine.ss\" \"tests\" \"framework\")")

which causes it to take car of null. Note that this function is not
written in 210 style. I am not sure exactly what it is trying to do, so
I won't attempt to suggest a fix...

Note: to find this bug, I changed, committed and tagged setupr.ss to make
it errortrace friendly. [As a side note, is it possible to make with-handlers
and errortrace communicate somehow so that uses of with-handlers in this
style do not eliminate errortrace's functionality?]
>How-To-Repeat:
be sure to checkout the tests collection. (the slatex collection has a
similary problem, maybe with the same root). Then run setup-plt on
the tests collection.

Add (require-library "errortrace.ss" "errortrace") at the top of setup.ss
for more info.
