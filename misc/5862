 Those docs are built for the distribution, but they're not in final form
 in CVS.
 
 There's a script in plt/teachpack/htdp/Docs/mkdocs, but it may require
 some support software (TrashyTexTools) that's not in the plt tree.

 Well, it's really an internal, not-for-the-general-public tool.
 
 The Teachpack documentation is kind of like the manuals documentation --
 it needs to be built.  But it's not downloadable like the manuals,
 currently.  Maybe that should change.
