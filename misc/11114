>Description:
Can the capability to effectively serialize a procedure be created? I need a way to [1] define a function, [2] take the function (assume non-primitive) and either (A) get the equivalent unevaluated source-code which can be re-eval'd into a function or (B) a way to (serialize my-proc), store it, and de-serialize later on.

I basically need to be able to compose a function, store it in a file, and retrieve it from the file.
