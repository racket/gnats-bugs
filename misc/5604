>Description:
Quoting-bar notation is overly complicated and
insufficiently flexible.  Since backslashes can be used
for special characters within regular symbols, it does
not seem necessary to use quoting bars for that purpose.
I suggest instead using quoting bars only as outermost
delimiters, and make backslashes quote bars.  So

'|a b" \\\|c\t\n| = (string->symbol "a b\" \\|c\t\n")

State-Changed-Why:
    A fine suggestion, but the existing syntax has
    a decade or two of momentum.
