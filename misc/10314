>Description:
DrScheme 4.2, Beginning Student, fabric-teachpack on Windows Vista.

An infinite loop occurs with the statement:

    (overlay (add-horiz-stripe 
                  'black 
                  30 
                  (create-solid-fabric 'yellow 240 200))
                  tshirt)

but <changing dimension of fabric>
    (overlay (add-horiz-stripe 
                  'black 
                  30 
                  (create-solid-fabric 'yellow 240 210))
                  tshirt)

works as expected, as does 
    (overlay (add-horiz-stripe 
                  'black 
                  35 
                  (create-solid-fabric 'yellow 240 210))
                  tshirt)

        <changing dimension of stripe>

 I'd rather close it after I've got the fix (since the user gets a
 "closed" email).
 
 I'm working on it now and get the following error (under Beginner
 Language, v4.2[3m]).
 
 require: namespace mismatch; reference (phase 0) to a module
 "C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\scheme\private\kw.ss" that is not
 available (phase level 0)
 
 I require mzlib/etc.ss, which in turn references kw.ss (I also require
 htdp/image.ss, htdp/error.ss, and lang/htdp-beginner.ss).  The
 teachpack works fine in module language.

 I don't remember exactly what, but there were some issues with using
 mzlib/etc -- but it's probably easier to just avoid it: what do you
 need it for?

 In this case the solution is probably very simple -- just switch to
 `scheme/base' and use `lambda' instead of `opt-lambda', since it's now
 the default.  You can also use optionals in plain definitions.
 
 (If you send me the code I can do a quick scan for these things...)
