 You have to use the metadata stuff for that to work, so that probably
 won't work soon for ACL2.
 
 Note that you have to explicitly change the language away from ACL2,
 or else it will still open in ACL2 (ie, opening an intermediate file
 that you've already got won't be enough to reproduce the problem). I
 believe.

 Yeah, files will continue to open in Dracula until you change
 languages.  And you're right about the metadata: fixing this would
 break the ability to load Dracula files directly in ACL2.  Of course,
 that's already broken for any files using our teachpack "books",
 because they're not in the default ACL2 load path.  But they can be
 added to the load path and then the file can be loaded; there's no
 such fix for DrScheme metadata.
 
 Personally, I don't think we should break the ACL2-usability of a file
 just because a user edits it once in Dracula.  If we had a way to make
 DrScheme save state without breaking that, I'd be in favor of
 implementing it.  With metadata as it is now, I favor the status quo.

 How about an Export menu? Many applications have that. We need it for  
 ProfessorJ, too.

 Yes, but you shouldn't have to export something you just opened.  It
 only makes sense to export if, when opening a pure-sexpression ACL2
 file, the regular "Save" is disabled and you have to "Save As".
 
 Now, if we can set DrScheme to maintain the current state of the file
 (add metadata when creating a file, keep it as-is when editing), then
 it will do "the right thing" when editing existing Dracula or ACL2
 files.  We could then use an Export menu for the case of switching
 metadata on/off for existing files.
 
 I don't know if that's doable with the current setup, but I can look into it.

 I had a suggestion not too long ago, and Robby also agreed that it
 makes sense and should be easy to implement.
 
 * DrScheme keeps the recently opened list of files in the preferences
   -- so all you need is to extend this so instead of filenames you
   hold a list of filename and the language that was used with that
   file.
 
 * When you open a file, you look in that list for the language setting
   to use.
 
 * It would also make sense to have it save a long list, but only show
   the first N items in the recent menu -- this way you can remember
   the settings for many files, without getting a ridiculously long
   menu.
 
 * You can extend this to more stuff -- cursor position, selection,
   scrollbar position, insert/overwrite mode, and favorite track to
   play while editing.  (In other words, it would be nice to put a
   generic property alist for every file.)

 Also, wrt to metadata -- the metadata can be in a comment as far as
 ACL2 goes. I'm not sure we want to go that route (I can't be sure what
 will happen, I mean), but it seems like it should work at first
 glance.

v4 with #lang and so forth.
