>Description:
All sorts of errors compiling/installing DrScheme.
No "mzscheme" or "mred" in plt/bin. They are
left in subdirectories of source. I had to create
links prior to executing "./install" from
the plt directory and to execute "drscheme"
from plt/bin. 

All sorts of warnings such as:

WARNING: language English defines ...etc
WARNING: language French defines...etc.

I won't go into further detail on the language
warnings because I can't seem to paste anything
into this window.

Compile errors with mzrl.so, mzdyn.o
Wish I could copy/paste into this window,
but it doesn't appear to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download and install as per instructions.

 One quick question to start: after `make', did you `make install'?
 
 Thanks,

Mostly addressed; some have to do with CVS exposing too much,
like readline.
