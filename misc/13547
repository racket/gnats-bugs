 I disagree on this point.  The point of the command is to make it
 executable, not necessarily to change read file permissions.
 
 The command you have above does more than make the script executable,
 and so it's doing something orthogonal to the point of the prose.

 Yeah, "chmod +x file" is the common idiom, and if you've just created
 the file (as the text goes) then it should be readable.

 I am sorry, I was sleeping and didn't see you're going to close it.

 Try chmod 000 <a_racket_executable_even_compiled_one> && chmod +x

 OK, I am sorry. I don't see it so often. But Advanced Bash Scripting
 recommends "chmod u+rx scriptname" (

 No harm, no foul.  We're just trying to strike a good balance between
 brevity and comprehensiveness.  Documentation is hard, and we try to
 consider the audience.  For that particular part of the docs, we're
 assuming the target audience already has basic Unix knowledge, enough
 just to remind the user that the script needs to have its executable
 bit set.
 
 ... besides, if a user knows enough to do chmod 000, they'd better
 already know how to set the read bit back on, or they're a danger to
 themselves and others.  :)
