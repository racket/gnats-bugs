>Description:
Attempting to pass an array element as an actual parameter corresponding to a call-by-name formal parameter that's assigned to in the body of the procedure results in the error message

    assignment: formal-argument variable lhs is assigned,
    but actual argument was not assignable
>How-To-Repeat:
Try running the following Algol 60 program:

    begin

        procedure assign(lhs, rhs);
            integer lhs;
            integer rhs;
        begin
            lhs := rhs
            end;

        integer j;
        integer array A[ 0 : 9 ];

        assign(j, 0);
        assign(j * j, 0)

        end

The first call to assign is processed correctly.  The second call is correctly reported to be erroneous:  the expression j * j has no l-value.  However, try running the program

    begin

        procedure assign(lhs, rhs);
            integer lhs;
            integer rhs;
        begin
            lhs := rhs
            end;

        integer j;
        integer array A[ 0 : 9 ];

        assign(j, 0);
        assign(A[ 0 ], 17)

        end

The second call is *incorrectly* reported to be erroneous:  the expression A[ 0 ] *does* have an l-value.

This clearly isn't a world-stopping problem;  however, I'd hoped to use DrScheme's Algol 60 language to demonstrate Jensen's Device in a course in spring 2009, so it'd be nice to have it fixed.

 Hi Alan, nice surprise. Jensen's device is actually coded up as an  
 example in the sample directory. Unless Algol60 broke recently, it  
 may still work for your demo.
