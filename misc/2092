>Description:
in the "net" collection, combine-url/relative fails for strings 
ending with "?;".  This comes up in the context of some javascript
strings.  The result is a substring error: 

substring: ending index 0 out of range [2, 2] for string: "?;"

ps.: this will be the first bug report submitted using OS X native
MrEd.  Exciting! (for me, anyway.)
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
(combine-url/relative (string->url "http://foo.com") "?;")
>Fix:

                                                            Nope, sounds fine to me.

thanks,

 That's not a legal URL, is it?

 I was writing a link checker, and I came across a bunch of javascript 
 URLs that looked like
 javascript:blahblahblah?;
 
 ... my understanding of combine-url/relative was that in the case in 
 which the second one was a "whole" url rather than a relative one, it 
 would just return the second one.
