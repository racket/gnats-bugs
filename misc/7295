 It cannot be distributed since readline is GPL.

 OK.  At some point I might find time to replace it
 using the non-GPL "libedit", or just write it in Scheme.

 Actually, it is in Scheme, and the interface is really minimal.  Now,
 I don't know enough about these things, and Matthew's the one who said
 that even if we write Scheme code that interacts with readline then we
 can't include it -- maybe if this libedit is similar, then the Scheme
 interface can officially be targeting the libedit interface, and using
 readline if that's not found -- will this make it distributable?

 I meant implementing the input editing and history in Scheme,
 perhaps using "curses" bindings.

 I would guess that has the same legal problem as the old "readline"
 collection.
 
 By the way, this is not a huge deal for me.  I just occasionally use the
 "mzscheme" REPL direct from a terminal rather than through Emacs.

 Ah...  I thought about doing something similar too when it comes to
 doing a "mzsh" thing.

 Probably...
