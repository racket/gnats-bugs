I cant seem to find a way in which i can load gif files and put it to the canvas i made.  
Would you find time to tell me how could it be done?

 To do what you want, create a bitmap% object, then use the draw-bitmap
 method of the canvas' device context, something like:
 
   (define bmp (make-object bitmap% ...))
   (send dc draw-bitmap ...)
 
 Look at bitmap% and draw-bitmap in Help Desk for more info.
