>Description:
I am attempting to build the DrScheme environment from source on a Pentium
Linux box (Mandrake 7.1).  I downloaded the source from Rice.

The configure script, run with or without command line options, produces 
the following output in a bash shell:

: command not found
: command not found
: command not found
: command not found
: command not found
'ash: ./configure: line 77: syntax error near unexpected token 'do
'ash: ./configure: line 77: 'do

Lines 76 and 77 of the configure script read:

for ac_option
do

I know Korn shell inside and out, but not sh/bash!  I did attempt to
run the configure script from a Korn shell session and got this output:

: not foundigure[2]:
: not foundigure[9]:
: not foundigure[34]:
: not foundigure[68]:
: not foundigure[74]:
ksh: ./configure[76]: for: bad identifier


>How-To-Repeat:
type ./configure at the command line in the directory where the source
code is installed.

 Is it remotely possible that the configure script somehow got unpacked
 in Windows-style CR-LF mode?
 
 I ask because those are the kind of errors I get for a CR-LF version of
 the file. Also, it seems that strange things have happened to the first
 character of each line in the error message.
