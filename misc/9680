>Description:
In DrScheme/GUI documentation, we often have pages listing several classes or interfaces and their various methods.  On the page, the indentation shows the hierarchy of what belongs to what.  However, there are no subsections or indentation in the links on the left side of the page that suggest where one interface ends and the next begins, so it's harder to jump to a desired region of the document.
>How-To-Repeat:

defines 3 interfaces; there is no easy way to jump to one in particular or see just a list of which names belong to which interface.

 I think that a solution for this is not to somehow fix the toc, but to
 add the extra layers as new subsections.  This will be a better
 organization, and will lead to other improvements like talking about
 what chapter 9 is about (there's nothing now), and what
 `drscheme:unit:tab<%>' is exactly (right now there's nothing beyon
 "implements: drscheme:rep:context<%>").  It might also require an
 additional form of a section context -- to identify all methods in a
 file as belonging to a class, as done with modules now.
