 Eh, Carl, looks like this is also a ticket on the planet site.  Sorry.

 This is a symptom of PR 12125, which is related to racket/sandbox.  At
 the moment I don't know of a way to fix this from my end.  A
 workaround is to require (planet cce/scheme:7) first, which will
 install the cce/scheme package directly.  The "unknown module:
 'program" bug only occurs when the install of cce/scheme is nested
 inside the install of cce/fasttest.
