 Can you tell me how you started guib and what "things" you do to get
 these errors?

 I started the gui-builder with (require-library ... .gui-builder) and moved
 icons. Since the MrEd icon was hidden, I didn't see which mouse clicks
 triggered the error messages. Sorry. I can send you the .gui file if that 
 helps, but I doubt it.

 I'll just let the bug report sit in GNATS until we find a way to
 reproduce the problem.
