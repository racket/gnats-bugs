>Description:
Under windows, somehow the command line is getting garbled
in a launcher.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; evaluate the program below
;; note that the parens are properly matched in l.
;; run d:\tmp.exe
;; get an error message about mis-matched parens.
;; There should be an error message about
;;   a non-existant file.

(require-library "launcher.ss" "launcher")

(define l

(make-mred-launcher l "d:\tmp.exe")

;; shows that parens are matched
(define (check-str n) (eval (read (open-input-string (list-ref l n)))))
