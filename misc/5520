 Jamie, I don't understand the bug report at all. 
 
 Here is how I solve the problem: 
 
 ;; check-guess : color color color color -> symbol
 (define (check-guess target1 target2 guess1 guess2)
   (cond
     ((and (eq? target1 guess1) (eq? target2 guess2))
      'perfect_guess)
     ((or  (eq? target1 guess1) (eq? target2 guess2))
      'one_color-at_correct_position)
     ((or  (eq? target1 guess2) (eq? target2 guess1))
      'the_colors_occur)
     (else 'nothing_correct)))
 
 
 ;; RUN: 
 (master check-guess)
 
 One doesn't need to know the colors to write the check guess
 function. Could you explain what you mean?

 Okay, I figured it out. You mean the docs and as it turns out, 
 one doesn't need to know about the colors at all, so I deleted
 them instead.
