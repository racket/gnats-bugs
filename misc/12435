>Description:
In document:
file:///c:/.../doc/plot/renderer3d.html

In Section 5.7 3D Rectangle Renderers, the sample to draw histograms references bounds->intervals which seems to be unbound.

Note this example also references linear-seq another unbound identifier (see: [racket-bug] all/12433: Unbound identifier: linear-seq)
