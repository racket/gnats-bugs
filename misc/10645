>Description:
Contract errors are reported in terms of a name's internal name, not its renamed name. It seems that the renamed name would make more sense.

Perhaps even better would be to use the internal name in positive positions and the renamed name in negative positions. But perhaps that's not worth the trouble: the module for positive blame sees both names anyway.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/load

(module a scheme
  (define (f x) "wrong")
  (provide/contract
   [rename f g
    (-> number? number?)]))

(require 'a)
(g 12) ;; 'a broke the contract <...> on f
(g 'a) ;; top-level broke the contract <...> on f

 Whoops -- I fixed this before noticing that you'd grabbed it, Stevie.
 Hope we didn't collide or fixes.

 It's been on my list, but I haven't gotten to it with my major class/c =
 push, so if you've already fixed it, feel free to grab the bug and mark =
 it closed!  (And thanks!)
