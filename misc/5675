>Description:
when analyzing:

(define (fib x) (if (< x 2) x (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2)))))
(fib 3)

the "<" primative function is identifed (underlined) as unknown ?

(but when analyzed without the "(fib 3)" line it's ok?)

State-Changed-Why:
    Not a bug.
    Use the right mouse button to click on "<" and then the
    "Show errors" menu item to see the error.
    (in the present case, the error is because "x" might be
    a complex number but "<" can only compare reals - use
    the "Show type" menu item to see x's type (note that the
    type contains "complex" several times, because type
    minimization is not yet implemented - it will be soon)).
    
    The reason no error showed up when the (fib 3)
    expression was not present is because errors are
    detected only when values flow around. If you don't use
    a function, nothing will flow into the function, so
    no errors will be detected.
