>Description:
If "Num circles" and "Ratio" are respectively 9 and 5 or 10 and 4, the animation freezes, and lowering the respective sliders' values does not unfreeze the animation.  It seems like when the values get that high, a too-small circle is attempted to be drawn and that is breaking something.  Display(s) in the Interactions Window of the values of the behaviors continue to update as the sliders change their values, and the CPU continues to be constantly used.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run collects/frtime/demos/circles.ss and increase the sliders for "Num circles" and "Ratio" to 9 and 5 or 10 and 4.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gcooper" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 03:09:53 -0400
Reason>>> frtime


State changed from "open" to "feedback" by gcooper at Sun, 06 May 2007 13:56:40 -0400
Reason>>> fixed animation.ss to test for rings with too-small radii;
problem no longer occurs for me


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 14:55:52 -0500
Reason>>> probably fixed
