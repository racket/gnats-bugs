>Description:
In send-url, when a custom browser is selected as part of the user's preferences, a command string is constructed using string-append.  Such a single-arg command appears to be interpreted as a call to the shell.  Consequently, send-url breaks if the url has shell metacharacters.  For example, the url:

    "http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/;id116*k2-1499047059"

will break badly, since semicolon is a shell metacharacter.

The Right Fix is to not manually construct a single shell command, but to send in the arguments unmolested as a list of arguments.  However, this entails also fixing the Browser preference panel in DrScheme to reflect this.

If it's a strong requirement that we do string-append those arguments together, then something like the following kludge should patch up common problems:

>How-To-Repeat:
Set Browser preferences such that the 'external-browser preference is set to a nonstandard browser like Firefox:

;;; within .plt-scheme/plt-prefs.ss
 (external-browser ("firefox " . ""))
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


On Unix platforms, the following should show the problem:

(require (lib "send-url.ss" "net"))
(send-url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/;id116*k2-1499047059")

Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sat, 12 May 2007 03:32:24 -0400
Reason>>> The intention is for you to quote the argument, by using
(for example) a single quote at the end of the prefix text
and the beginning of the suffix text.  But the whole thing
is broken in many other ways, and will be seriously revised
in the near future.  (Finally.)
