>Description:
The combination of a case-> type-spec primitive and a higher-order use of
that primitive causes Spidey to mis-type the result of the primitive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Spidey claims that the type of this expression:

  (apply thread-weight (list (thread (lambda () (void)))))

is void when it should be num or (union num void).

 This appears to be a problem with the type of apply in language.ss.
 I'll see if I can fix it.

 Matthias actually patched language.ss. He added a new case in the case->
 for thread-weight:
 
   ((union (list thread) (list thread num)) *-> (union num void))
 
 and spidey now gets (union num void) for the result of the expression
 above.
 
 Apparently, the last entry in a case-> must be a catch-all that spidey
 uses if the primitive appears in a ho position. There are other
 primitives that get this wrong. I noticed
 current-library-collection-paths, but there may be others.
