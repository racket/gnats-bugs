>Description:
Scrolling a test suite produces an error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a New Test Suite.
In it, create as many New tests as necessary until a scroll bar appears.  (It isn't necessarily to populate the filename section or the test cases.)  It takes four New's for me.
Now scroll down.  The first few pixels scroll successfully,
but a little ways in -- roughly when the first test case
is no longer fully on screen -- you get the following error.

Popup: draw-rectangle in dc<%>: expects argument of type <non-negative number>; given -1.0

Standard Output: contains the same message

Thereafter, the main pane of the test suite window no longer
redraws.
