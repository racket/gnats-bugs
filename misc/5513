>Description:
when I run setup -c from the distribution, I get:
...

- It would be nice for SLaTeX install to fail with a more helpfull message
than "(Permission denied; errno=13)" which I presume is related to the
fact that I don't have the nessisary supporting SW on my system. As was
the case for "readline", or even better ala MzCom/MysterX.

>How-To-Repeat:
try setup -c on a basic OSX system.

 It looks to me like this bug report can be closed.  That is, you got a 
 message about permissions, and it really was a permissions problem, and 
 nothing to do with SLaTeX.  Is this correct?

 Yes closed, (the only semi-related issue is that is that since I still
 haven't installed apple's compiler tools yet, read-line doesn't build from
 the plt-cvs binary distribution.)
