Solaris
>Description:
As mentioned in my last bug report, I wrote a program to write
a graphics window to a TIFF file so that I can print it
(using the xv program).  The program works on my laptop, using
release 53 , IBM PC Windows 95 port of DrScheme, but when I
moved the program to my Solaris workstation, I found that
the procedure returned by get-pixel always returns 1 no matter
what the color of the addressed pixel is.  Thus, on my laptop,
my program produces a TIFF file that looks exactly like the
graphics window that generated it.  When the identical program
is run on either of the Solaris machines at my disposal (one
is version 2.5 of Solaris, and the other is version 2.7), I
get a TIFF file showing a window the same size as the graphics
window, but it is all black.

Incidentally, while debugging my program, I noticed that if
for any reason the graphics window is not visible while my
program is writing the TIFF file, that portion of the image
that was written while the graphics window was not visible
is all white.  Fortunately, I found a way to avoid the call
to system that I used in my early versions of the program,
which was the cause of the graphics window disappearing while
the TIFF file was being written.
>How-To-Repeat:
(open-graphics)
(define w (open-viewport "test" 100 100))
((get-pixel w) (make-posn 50 50))

The value I get back is 1.
