>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 31 Jul 2007 08:04:36 -0400
Reason>>> It looks like an intermediate version of "mxdemo.ss"
got commited somehow, probably when I was adding
define-runtime-path uses. Fixed in SVN.


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Tue, 07 Aug 2007 20:43:23 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew closed
