Computer Language: (("Legacy Languages" "Swindle" "Full Swindle") #(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug/profile))
>Description:
In Full Swindle with "Dynamic Properties" set to "Debugging" (the default setting), calling the define-struct function yields the following error:

require: namespace mismatch; reference (phase 1) to a module "/usr/local/share/plt-5.2/collects/errortrace/errortrace-key.rkt" that is not available (phase level 0) in: errortrace-key

This seems to be a bug, since setting Full Swindle's Dynamic Properties to either "No debugging or profiling" OR "Debugging and profiling" solves the issue.
>How-To-Repeat:
- set language to Full Swindle with debugging under the "Choose Language..." dialogue.
- evaluate a define-struct expression in either the interactions or definitions pane.
- error occurs and any other definitions are not evaluated.

- set Dynamic Properties to either "No debugging or profiling" or "Debugging and profiling"
- evaluate a define-struct expression again
- no error.

 There were a number of problems with error trace that got resolved
 since version 5.2 -- I've verified that I can see this problem in that
 version, but not in 5.2.1 or in the development version.
