>Description:
if the file being analyzed is not contained in a directory within the
plt directory heirarchy, a "(require "xxxx.ss"), results in a "/xxxx.ss
file not found error", which implies that it doesn't search the files
parent directory, which is properly done by default otherwise.

>How-To-Repeat:
define a source file "yyyy.ss" in a foriegn directory, which contains
"(require "xxxx.ss"), where "xxxx.yy" is a source file also contained
in that directory, open "yyyy.ss", select "analyze", see error message.

 drscheme:eval:expand-program isn't setting the directory for you.
 That's a change I believe I sent email out about? In any case,
 drscheme:eval:expand-program doesn't have enough information to
 properly determine the `current-directory' and
 `current-load-relative-directory' parameter's values. You have to do it
 yourself, in the `init' thunk.
