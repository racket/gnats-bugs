>Description:
After building DrScheme from source, in Graphical language I tried the Contour and Vector Field plot in Figure 3 of this paper:

http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/sw2003/PLoTScheme.pdf

and got an error:

field: use of a class keyword is not in a class top-level in: (field (gradient (lambda x y) (* -1 (gravitational-potential x y)))) (samples 22) (style (quote normalized)))

 I think that `field' was renamed to `vector-field' to avoid colliding
 with `field' as exported by "class.ss".

Class changed from "support" to "not-a-bug" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 02:56:15 -0400
Reason>>> .

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 02:56:15 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 02:56:15 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew explained (and fixed the example)
