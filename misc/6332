>Description:
compile: variable not provided (directly or indirectly and at the expected position) from module: |,/usr/local/plt/collects/framework/framework| in: provide/contract-contract67796

When running drscheme I get the above problem.  Removing the compiled folder in framework moves the error to gui-utils, but then remaking the directory compiled (just the directory not the files that it contained) and removing the directory compiled in private moves the error back to the above.
>How-To-Repeat:
I installed drscheme 2.04 from sources.
I actually installed it in /usr/local (configure --prefix=/usr/local)
Then I moved the collect directory to /usr/local/plt and changed the PLTHOME reference and the reference to the bins in all the scripts provided in /usr/local/bin.

 After you do all that moving around, you need to re-run setup-plt. That
 should fix the problem you're seeing.
