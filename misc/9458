>Description:
The following code dies with an uncaught exception (namely: with-limit: out of memory), presumably because the call to "get-output" is happening in the "context" of the sandbox-eval-limits.  This surprised me, so it'd be nice if the documentation made it clear that that function is indeed under that parameter's control.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require scheme/sandbox)
(define sb (parameterize ((sandbox-output       'string)
                          (sandbox-eval-limits '(2 20)))
             (make-evaluator '(begin))))

(with-handlers
    ([void
      (lambda (v)
        (printf "Caught exception:~a~%" (exn-message v)))])

  (sb
   (format "~s"
           (quote
            (let loop ()
              (printf "Yee-ha~%")
              (loop))))))

(string-length (get-output sb))
