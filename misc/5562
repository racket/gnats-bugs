Human Language: english
>Description:
In Algol 60, a parse error leads to a syntax highlighting --
but of entirely the wrong thing.
>How-To-Repeat:
Select language Algol 60.
In a fresh REPL, type the following (without indentation):

  3+4;
  43

On hitting Return, DrScheme prints

  parser error near +

and highlights a single character.  That character is,
unfortunately, the `e&apos; of "Welcome to DrScheme ...".
Entering

  3 + 4 ;
  43

instead highlights the `l&apos; of the same banner, etc.

 This bug should be closed; I just tried this on 5.3.2, and the
 highlight is correctly on the "+" now.
