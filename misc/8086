>Description:
Dr Scheme is a very powerful and seful computational tool for me as a scientist.  Practically, it works most of the time when I use it; however, when I minimize the DrScheme editor, run some other application, then return to the DrScheme editor, it crashes (not responding).  I have to ctrl+alt+del and end the process.  This never fails to happen.  Other versions never did this.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open the DrScheme editor (v301), minimize it, and run one or more applications such as microjoke work or excel.  You can even minimize the Scheme editor and just let time pass without running other applications.  Return to the DrScheme editor and try to do anything.  You cannot even highlight text.
