>Description:
THe problem is that this behavior is inconsistent...  for a base url of scheme "http", fragment identifiers are 
combined correctly.  But for a base url of scheme "file", fragment identifiers aren't combined (this argument is
assumed to be a relative path.) but raise an error.  Although combine-url/relative doesn't claim to handle this 
case, it seems that it should.

Illustrative Code:
> (combine-url/relative (string->url "http://www.cs.rice.edu")
                         "index2.html#anchor_name")
(make-url "http" "www.cs.rice.edu" #f "/index2.html" #f #f "anchor_name")
 
> (combine-url/relative (string->url "http://www.cs.rice.edu")
                        "#anchor_name")
(make-url "http" "www.cs.rice.edu" #f "/" #f #f "anchor_name")
 
> (combine-url/relative (string->url "file:///home/bonfield/index.html")
                        "index.html#anchor_name")
(make-url "file" #f #f "/home/bonfield/index.html" #f #f "anchor_name")
 
> (combine-url/relative (string->url "file:///home/bonfield/index.html")
                        "#anchor_name")
build-path: 2nd pathname element is an empty string; other arguments were: "/home/bonfield/"


I would expect the last case in the code above to produce a result similar to the second case since
fragment identifiers are not only necessary, but combine for base URLs of scheme "http".
>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "url.ss" "net")

(combine-url/relative (string->url "file:///home/bonfield/index.html")
                        "#anchor_name")
