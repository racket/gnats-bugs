>Description:
An (intern ...) function would be nice.  Currently I'm using 
string.ss's (read-from-string (symbol->string ...)).  Is there a
more direct approach?

Also, if there is a way to check the value of local variables 
within the backtrace window, I'd like to know what it is.

 You didn't want
 
  (string->symbol (symbol->string ...))
 
 ?
 
 I guess the difference is that `read-from-string' lowercases symbol. I
 can't think of a more direct way if that's what you want.

 Not yet. We're still working on the general-purpose debugger.
 
 Thanks for the feedback,
 Matthew
