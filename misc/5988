>Description:
I enjoy using DrScheme. I made some code doing, at the end, a lot of plottinf/drawing of complexe surfaces like CAD. It is slow, too slow.
I would like to use some existing "packages" like VTK, or JAVA 3D.

I would like to excecute a Java 3D applet making the drawing like the help 
included in DrScheme. I gave a glance at the documentation for html,
server and co but I am a bit lost.

Do you have some code sample which might help me?
Samples in the existing package for the Help of Drscheme?


Thank you very much for your help.

Yours Sincerely.

Jerome HUCK.

 If you look at plt/collects/help/servlets/, you'll see the Scheme code
 for Help Desk itself. 
 
 You can run Java code by putting in APPLET tags, as usual, except the
 tags will be in S-expressions:
 
   (APPLET ... )
