>Description:
SLaTeX seems to be only able to handle short lines.
It violates string-set!'s contract if the line is too
long:

 I realize now that this only really matters if there is an accidentally
 unterminated \scheme somewhere on the long line. It seems fine to me
 that the argument to \scheme has to have some kind of fixed length,
 since it is always typeset on the same line.
 
 It just makes the errors hard to track down, since I have to go around
 chopping up my paragraphs (yes, I use an editor with *gasp* word
 wrapping! how non-emac'y of me... :) to figure out what is going on.

Responsible-Changed-By: eli
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 04:38:39 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:
Unclaimed



Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 06 Apr 2004 21:09:03 -0400
Reason>>> Replying

State changed from "open" to "feedback" by eli at Tue, 06 Apr 2004 21:09:03 -0400
Reason>>> I don't know what to do with this -- I've looked at the 
code, and there is a numeric constant with line 
allocations at some fixed size.  I suspect that tracing 
where these strings are used and making sure that they are 
long enough would be problematic (the easiest way I can 
think of is simply writing an implementation for an 
unlimited string which realocates on need, then replace 
all string functions with that).  But is this really worth 
the effort?  If it does, should I do it or is this Dorai's?

State changed from "feedback" to "suspended" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 14:30:12 -0500
Reason>>> SLaTeX
