>Description:
Place a Scheme box inside the attribute of an XML tag. 
Accidentally (as in beginner student) put the string 
quotes around the attribute. See this error message: 

 peek-char: non-character in an unsupported context,
 from port: #<user-input-port>

This could be an internal bug, but at a min, it's 
a bad message to a student. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Insert XML box. 
Type <a href="
Insert Scheme box. 
Type random stuff in Scheme box. 
Type ">
Wait for completion
Then type wow
and hit RUN.

 This seems to be a bug in the xml collection. Do we have a maintainer
 for that, these days? (I did what has been done in the 299 port (or
 cleaned up the partway done one a little, more accurately)).

 That was Paul Graunke, and he's no longer around.
 
 I suggest Eli take on such collections. Any thoughts?

 I did what I can so far -- trace the source of the bug.  It is in
 collects/xml/private/reader.ss, around line 243:
 
        [(#\' #\")
         (list->string
          (let read-more ()
            (let ([c (non-eof peek-char in pos)])
              (cond
                [(eq? c delimiter) (read-char in) null]
                [(eq? c #\&)
                 (let ([entity (expand-entity (lex-entity in pos))])
                   (if (pcdata? entity)
                       (append (string->list (pcdata-string entity)) (read-more))
                       ;; more here - do something with user defined entites
                       (read-more)))]
                [else (read-char in) (cons c (read-more))]))))]
 
 That usage of peek-char is the one that crashes.  The question is what
 should be a fix -- I'd just raise an error, but I don't know what's
 the policy of dealing with such Scheme boxes that are at the wrong
 places.

 My hunch is that it should raise a defined and exported exception
 that Robby's XML boxes in DrScheme can turn into a good error
 message for students. -- Matthias

 It should probably use peek-char-or-special and if it gets a non-char
 it should raise an xml syntax error. That's my guess.

 No, I don't think that drscheme should be involved (in that manner).
 Why should this error message be different than the one you'd get for
 this:
 
   <a href=">
 
 or this:
 
   <a href=></a>
 
 or whatever?

 My impression was (and obviously I seem to be wrong) that you
 change error messages for the language levels so that the
 students don't get bad feedback.

 Well, the teaching langauges (nearly) re-implement lots of stuff, yeah.
 But they have different semantics than the full language versions. In
 the case of the xml boxes, tho, it's the same parser for all language
 levels, which seems okay since it's the same language. Probably any
 improvements that could be made to improve the beginner's experience
 would improve others's as well.
