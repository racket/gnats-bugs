                             (circle 3 "solid" "red"))))

Beginning students are not comprehending the error message they get back




"check-expect: check-expect requires two  
expressions. Try (check-expect test expected)."

Suggestion is to supplement the error message  with 
 "1st argument to check-expect = ....."
 2nd argument to check-expect = ""

 Kathy, let me recommend this. Change the message to
 
   "Try (check-expect test-expression expected-value-expression)"
 
 That's sufficient.
