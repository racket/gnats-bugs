>Description:
Invoking the function bellow on a URL and an associative list of arguments should return some page with the data posted to it. I have set up my own little test page on my webserver. I'll spare this bug post the code for setting up a webpage that receives post data. When I invoke the function on some associative list with the names of parameters of the page at the given URL it returns a page that looks like no data has been posted to it. The result of the (string->bytes/utf-8 (alist->form-urlencoded alist)) part look reasonable so I think that this is a problem with post-pure-port.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require
 (lib "url.ss" "net")
 (lib "uri-codec.ss" "net"))

(define (post url alist)
  (display-pure-port
   (post-pure-port
    (string->url url)
    (string->bytes/utf-8 (alist->form-urlencoded alist)))))

Reason>>> Looks like it's working now, so probably fixed since this 
PR.  FWIW, I've used the same code with this minimal script 
to check it:

  #!/bin/sh
  echo ""; cat -; echo ""
