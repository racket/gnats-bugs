 The file glu32.dll is for the OpenGL support in Windows.
 
 On my Windows XP box, I see that file in the directory
 WINDOWS\System32\.  I also see the file opengl32.dll there.
 
 If I were to guess, I'd guess that your XP was an upgrade installation
 from another version of Windows that didn't include OpenGL, and
 therefore XP didn't install it, either.
 
 You should be able to find those files on the XP installation CD,
 probably in a .CAB file.  I believe that XP lets you browse the contents
 of .CAB files directly in Explorer.
