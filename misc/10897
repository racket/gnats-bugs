>Description:
I think that the implementation of OWN (the modifier for static variables in Algol 60) is broken. I believe that the code below should have worked. Here is the output I get:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.2.5 [3m].
Language: Algol 60; memory limit: 128 MB.
. . set-box!: expects argument of type <mutable box>; given #<undefined>

Please have a look at paragraph 4 of section 5 in the Revised Report for Algol 60. Thanks!
>How-To-Repeat:
begin
  integer procedure count(s);
  value s;
  integer s;
  begin
    own integer a;
    if s = 0 then begin a := 0 end
    else begin a := a + 1 end;
    count := a
  end;

  printnln(count(0));
  printnln(count(1));
  printnln(count(1))
end
