>Description:
In Honu's tool.ss, I have the following declaration, which I took
directly from ProfessorJ's tool.ss:

      (define mode-surrogate
        (new color:text-mode%
             (matches (list (list '|{| '|}|)
                            (list '|(| '|)|)
                            (list '|[| '|]|)))
             (get-token get-syntax-token)
             (token-sym->style short-sym->style-name)))

If I remember correctly, this _was_ working before, but since I
added in coloring of different syntactic forms, I seem to have
lost the paren matching highlighting.  I'm not sure if this is
my fault, having overlooked something I should be doing (what
other than providing the matches should I do then?), but I'd
appreciate having it checked into when the chance arises.
>How-To-Repeat:
Select Honu as your language and then type anything with parens
or braces (or load any of the example code in
collects/honu/examples) and then notice that the match highlighting
isn't working.

 As a general rule, if you can't figure it out from the docs, please
 submit a docs bug (and ask a question if you need quick turnaround).
 
 This helps us figure out how our docs can be improved and is preferred
 to PRs like this one.

 What's incomplete?  He had it working, now it's breaking.  You can 
 change it into a doc bug or something.

 I've figured out the problem.
 
 The lexer I'd written for the syntax coloring was not returning  
 (string->symbol lexeme) in the appropriate place for grouping  
 operators (every rule was using just #f), so that's why it didn't  
 know to color them.  After looking at the examples in collects/syntax- 
 color, it finally hit me what the problem was.
 
 So if I'd thought to look at the doc.txt for the syntax-color  
 collection, then I'd probably have found this problem instantly, but  
 nothing made it obvious to look there at first.  Looking at the  
 doc.txt, I realize I was searching for instances of color:text-mode%,  
 not color-text%, which is what actually appears in that text.

 I went and re-read the PR and it sure looks like it is of the form "my 
 code doesn't work. here's an incomplete piece of it. I copied it from 
 somewhere else. can you help me?" instead of something of the form "the 
 docs say <something> but this small, complete example does <somethign 
 else>."
 
 The outside world sends us such thing and we ignore them or try to 
 contact them. Internally, we have to do better.
 
 See Stevie's followup for confirmation of my original impression.
 
 (Everyone has had to receive this message from someone ... I got it 
 from Matthew and have been sending it on even since :)

 I preached it just the other day: to Stevie, to Viera, and a number of 
 other people.
 
 I just found the original bug report close enough but I think you're 
 right.
 
 Nuff said. -- Matthias

 After rereading what I sent myself, I can definitely agree with  
 this.  Oops.

 Well, I am curious if it would be possible to reference the Syntax  
 Color collection as an example of how to do syntax coloring/paren  
 match highlighting for editor modes somewhere other than in that  
 collection -- perhaps in section 2.5 of the PLT Tools manual or on  
 the page in the same manual that talks about drscheme:modes:add-mode,  
 which was one of the first places I started my search?
 
 Also, is there still a color-text% (which is what the Syntax Color  
 doc.txt talks about) or has that been replaced with color:text-mode%  
 (which is another term on which I searched and found nothing useful)?

 Stevie

 I'm talking about the quote "I have the following declaration, which I
 took directly fro ProfessorJ's tool.ss". That doesn't seem to be a
 reference to any documentation! 
 
 In any case, I think that this horse is now beaten to death ...

 Assuming you mean "color:text", those are two different things. I have
 docs for both.
 
 I suspect you installed from svn, but missed some of the instructions?
 See the "Getting Updated Documentation" section of the svn installation
 instructions. http://svn.plt-scheme.org/
 
 If that's not it, I'm not sure what's going wrong. Perhaps you can tell
 me how you installed PLT and maybe I can help more?

 Oh, I wasn't meaning that I had said that I did this in the original
 report.  I was trying to add more info on what I did try to look up
 documentation-wise so that it might provide more help on what might
 have helped.

 Syntax Color's doc.txt pretty clearly says "color-text%" instead of
 "color:text%", and this is from the most recent SVN revision.
 
  From that doc.txt:
 
 -----
 
 The syntax-color collection provides the underlying data structures
 and some helpful utilities for the color-text% class of the framework
 (collects/framework/private/color.ss).
 
 ...
 
 _default-lexer.ss_
 A lexer that only identifies the following: ( ) [ ] { }
 also build specifically for color-text%.
 
 -----
 
 Which is why I likely missed it when doing a last ditch grep of the
 collects tree on variations of color:text and color:text-mode.
 
 Thanks,
 Stevie

 This is probably a useful thing to inform Scott of.
 
 I've cc'd him on the PR. 
 
 If that's the only complaint (did you find the other docs?) feel free
 to shift the PR to him.
