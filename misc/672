I downloaded and installed DrScheme.  I am trying to use the sample programs, but I have
noticed that the file cards.ss is missing from the package, so some of the samples don't work.

Please tell me where I can find it.

Sorry for the delayed reply.

How did you find the sample programs that use cards.ss?

The games/cards collection was intentionally left undistributed
because our only card images are from Microsoft's Solitaire (though I
didn't know that when I started using them), so they probably can't be
re-distributed.

However, games/gofish and games/blackjack slipped through. They won't
be in the next release unless we find some card images soon. Since you
discovered that cards.ss is not present, I wonder whether you found
these two games yourself, or whether there's a link to them from
somewhere else.

We'll distribute everything with 100.
