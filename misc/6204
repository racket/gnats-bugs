 You have to use alt-return (or something, depending on your platform).

 Where do I find the documentation for that?
 Alt-Return doesn't seem to work on Windows.

 alt-enter? control-return? control-enter? 
 
 I'll update the docs.

 I tried all those and many more ... still no luck.

 Can you try running this code and tell me if alt-enter, alt-return, or
 anything at all gets "evaluating" to print out?
 
 [ Matthew, Paul cannot get the "force the repl to accept my input now"
   alt-return keystroke to work, but it seems to be fine on my computer
   ... ]
 
 (define t%
   (class text%
     (rename [super-on-local-char on-local-char])
     (define/override (on-local-char key)
       (let ([code (send key get-key-code)])
         (cond
           [(or (eq? code 'numpad-enter)
                (equal? code #\return)
                (equal? code #\newline))
            (if (send key get-alt-down)
                (printf "evaluating\n")
                (super-on-local-char key))]
           [else (super-on-local-char key)])))
     (super-instantiate ())))
 
 (define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400 400))
 (define t (make-object t%))
 (define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
 (send f show #t)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
