>Description:
As I understand, the foldr and foldl functions are implemented
like this:

(define (foldr2 combiner base inlist)
  (cond [(empty? inlist) base]
        [else (combiner (first inlist)
                        (foldr2 combiner base (rest inlist)))]))

(define (foldl2 combiner base inlist)
  (cond [(empty? inlist) base]
        [else (foldl combiner
                     (combiner (first inlist)
                               base)
                     (rest inlist))]))

If this is the case, I think the contracts specified in the
documentation are wrong. Because the result of the combiner may be
passed as the 2nd argument to the same combiner, its range must
equal--or at least be a subset of--the domain of its second
argument. Specifically, the two fold functions' contact should be:

(x y -> y) y (listof x) -> y

Certainly the range should be y and not z, for if the function is
passed the empty list as "inlist" then it will return simply the
value of "base," which is of type y.

If you meant to write that z was a subset of y, then this should
have been stated explicitly.

Also, the "purpose" section is not too helpful. If I already know
what the functions do, then it can help me remember, but it is not
at all clear to a novice programmer (as one of them recently told
me). A few examples, or perhaps a brief description of the function
would be much better.

I hope this is helpful.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look up foldr, foldl in help desk.
>Fix:
the result should be z u y but i'll go with the ml contract
