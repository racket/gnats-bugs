>Description:
After selecting the DrScheme manual on the help menu, I tried to 
print one of the pages to a file.  Instead of getting the page I
was looking at, I got the top page, the one that looks like the
table of contents.
>How-To-Repeat:
Click on help, click on DrScheme Programming Envitonment Manual,
click on position operations, click on file, click on OK.  What I
get is Ghostview looking at the top page of the manual, the page that
looks like an outline with nothing but pointers to other pages
on it.

Incidentally, another annoying behavior I noticed is that when
I select the index and then click on a item in the index, the
page that is jumped to is not the page containing that item, but
the beginning of a very large section containing the item I
wanted.  I noticed this particularly on the R4RS document, where
the large section consists of about 80% of the entire document.
With that much to scan manually, the index isn't much help.

 Perhaps we can add support to find the installed web browser and just call 
 it with the url? I think that mzscheme has enough support to do that on the 
 mac (apple events should be enough), and under unix we can just add some 
 preferences and use `system'.
 
 Windows is the tricky one. I know that programs can find some web browser, 
 but I have no idea how they do it.
 
 What do you think?
