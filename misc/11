>Description:
We need a better way for people who download PLT to install the system
locally on their machines (especially those who want to install it
someplace other than /usr/local/lib/plt/, but don't want each user to
have to set PLTHOME).  (Even Rice CS falls in this category!)  Note
especially Michael Sperber's comments.

I'm putting this out there so it'll get noticed (hopefully) before the
next release and will get fixed.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
An `install' script has been created for Unix. It must be run from
its own directory and it sets PLTHOME in scripts in plt/bin/. See
~mflatt/plt/install for more information.

 I left it open since no one besides me has ever tried the script (as
 far as I know).

 This is funny, it looks like it was queued on the new GNATS server, rather 
 than forwarded to Rice.
 
 Can you try another one?

 I've checked it in. See plt/collects/help/bug-report.ss. I'm not sure it was the right addresses, but I thought it was. See what you think.
