>Description:
combinator-example.ss has:

(require (lib "unit.ss")
         (lib "lex.ss" "parser-tools")
         (lib "combinator-unit.ss" "parser-tools"))

but the last line should be:

   (lib "combinator-unit.ss" "combinator-parser"))
>How-To-Repeat:
In file menu, click open, then select:

/usr/lib/plt/collects/combinator-parser/examples/combinator-example.ss

then click run.  I got error message:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 372 [3m].
Language: (module ...).
open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/usr/lib/plt/collects/parser-tools/combinator-unit.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
> 

However, when I copied the contents into another definitions window made the change described above,
and then clicked run, not error message appeared.
