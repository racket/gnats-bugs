>Description:
Apparently, the definition of the sllgen:* names as syntactic forms rather than procedures (as in the EOPL authors' implementation) causes a problem when using indirect variables to denote grammars or scanner specs. I believe this qualifies as a bug, because (a) its behavior differs from the original SLLGEN implementation, and (b) I require a behavior consistent with the EOPL authors' implementation.
 :)

Thanks!
>How-To-Repeat:
Consider the following:

;typical scanner spec
(define scanner-spec ...)

;typical grammar definition
(define grammar-1 ...)

;creates a reference to grammar-1
(define the-grammar grammar-1)  

;this works just fine
(sllgen:make-define-datatypes scanner-spec grammar-1)

;this DOES NOT WORK, but rather gives "bad grammar specification"
(sllgen:make-define-datatypes scanner-spec the-grammar)
