Human Language: English
>Description:
The "setup" and "version" collections contain files
that import (lib "mred.ss" "mred"). While "setup" and "version"
are needed in the MzScheme distribution the "mred" collection
shouldn't be there.

The solution might be to simply mask out the MrEd-importing
modules for the MzScheme distribution. Or a bit of re-arranging
may be necessary.

(For 200alpha1, we can just include the "mred" collection with
MzScheme.)
>How-To-Repeat:
unpack the mzscheme distibrution
delete plt/collects/mred
try installing
