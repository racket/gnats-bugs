 Since your address is dec.com, I suspect you're running the
 OSF1 version. In that case, the scripts in plt/bin are not
 quite right for OSF1. Each script contains something like:
    ${PLTHOME}/.../mred ... "$@"
 but it should be:
    ${PLTHOME}/.../mred ... ${1+"$@"}
 
 (The latter seems to work on all platforms. The scripts have
 been corrected for the next release.)
