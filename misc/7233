>Description:
This bug is in Pregexp 1e9, but I've been unable to reach Dorai.

This bug is actually a huge problem in that breaks a regexp idiom that I use extensively.

It's a known bug.  The question is whether someone who knows the code can fix it, or we have to find/write a different portable regexp impementation for Scheme.
