>Description:
In PLT's R6RS test program, (tests r6rs io ports) calls
set-port-position! with a second argument that was not
returned by a previous call to port-position.  This
violates a "should" in R6RS library 8.2.6.  Here's a
patch that fixes the problem:

% svn diff ports.sls

>How-To-Repeat:
In ERR5RS mode, Larceny v0.97 will issue a warning about this problem.
I haven't yet decided whether Larceny's R6RS mode should raise an
exception or just ignore it.
