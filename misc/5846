>Description:
First, I'm really happy there is a Mac OS X version of Dr. Scheme. I don't know when that happened but I am happy to hear about it. Second, I propose that everything in the "PLT v202" folder, (located at /Applications after installation), point to other things with relative location. Also, make that same folder (and it's contents) writable by admin users. 

This will allow 2 things. First, we can move the PLT folder wherever we want it. Personally, I do not want it installed in /Applications. I put all non-Apple apps in a separate directory. Second, it is the "Mac way." It is uncommon for Mac users to not be able to touch things, especially with applications in Mac OS X. 

I do not think it would be terribly difficult to implement this as you only need to remove hard links and use relative links instead. Also, your installation script will simply need to search for the PLT folder (or allow a user to Browse to it) so it can install other apps into the same directory.

Installing things into Library/Frameworks is acceptable but in my mind, not necessary. Those could be kept in the PLT directory just like everything else. I don't know of other applications, other than ones you would install in the PLT folder which would use those Frameworks. But, as I said, it's acceptable.

I'm just trying to point out ways you can help make your applications more comfortable in the hands of Mac users. We were able to move around Dr. Scheme in OS 9 and I don't see why there should be a difference in OS X.

Also, the interface could use some reworking. Right now, the interface makes the application look like a bad carbon port. It would be much more Mac OS X friendly if the interface were rebuilt using Mac OS X's interface builder.

Thank you for your time. I would appreciate feedback on my suggestions. Maybe some of what I suggest is just impossible and I don't know it. I would like to know what is possible and what is not, and then what you would consider doing. Thank you.
