>Description:
I have sent a message to the mailing list about this titled:
"Serializable Structs and Contracts"

I just found this must be a bug. I tried 4.2.1, 4.2.5 and now 5.0.0.1. 

All have the same behaviour. If you define a contract for a define-serialize-struct in a lang scheme module, the program fails. However, it succeds if the struct is defined in a lang scheme/base module with the appropriate requires.
>How-To-Repeat:
Failing program:
----
#lang scheme

(define-serializable-struct point
  (x y))

(provide/contract
 [struct point ((x number?) (y number?))])
----

Program that succeeds:
----
#lang scheme/base

(require scheme/serialize
         scheme/contract)

(define-serializable-struct point
  (x y))

(provide/contract
 [struct point ((x number?) (y number?))])

 This was my misconceptions of lang scheme.
 scheme does not export scheme/serialize, that's the problem. I though
 scheme exported scheme/*.
