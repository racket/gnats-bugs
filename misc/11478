 Objects are very likely to close over hidden state. You could use
 self% to call a new constructor, but you'll have problems doing this
 from a super-method

 Just as a note to myself, a related request from Jay last year, which =
 might point towards the correct way of resolving this:
 
 -----
 
 You should make a bigger deal of this and add something like Ryan's
 update-self/copy-self macro for doing functional objects.

 So there are two possible issues here: 1) giving classes the machinery =
 necessary to write "clone" methods that can be called on instances, and =
 2) possibly allowing for external cloning of an object in specific cases =
 (e.g., objects of a class where the cloning code holds the appropriate =
 inspector for all classes in the hierarchy).  Of course, such cloning is =
 still limited in that state which is closed over by method definitions =
 but is not part of the fields of the class cannot be duplicated, as Jay =
 has mentioned.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sstrickl at Wed, 16 Feb 2011 09:52:00 -0500
Reason>>> There's no reason for this to be open; I've looked at it, I just haven't had time yet 
to go back and do anything about it.
