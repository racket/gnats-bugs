>Description:
When a private attribute and method share the same name, a syntax error gets emitted, but not one that makes it obvious that name overlap occured.  In the steps below, the following error message shows up:

class: bad form for method definition in: (quote a-shape)

which points to the first definition.

This is confusing: it really should say "duplicate declared identifier", and point the blame at the square method declaration rather than the first.
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate the following:

#lang scheme
(class object%
  (define square 'a-shape)
  (define/public (square n)
    (* n n)))

The error message points to the first definition rather than the second, with a non-obvious error message.
