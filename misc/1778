>Description:
Hello, my name is Daniel, from the Technion - Israel technology institute.
When working with DrScheme, i found out that it doesn`t support the two expressions runtime and sequence. When working with MIT sceme, these expressions are evaluated normally. Because of this problem, i find it hard to work with DrScheme.  If you have any list of unsupported expressions, or the replacement for these expresions, please send it to me. for further details, please contact me.  You can find detailes about MIT scheme at MIT university, in the united states.
thank you, Daniel
>How-To-Repeat:
(define  start-time (runtime))
(display (runtime))
(sequence
   (display (+ 2 3))
   (display (+ 5 8))
   (display  (- start-time (runtime))))

 Hi Daniel,
 
 As I mentioned earlier today, those primitives are not part of
 standard Scheme, and we don't plan on implementing them.  You can do
 something equivalent using the TIME construct in Scheme: for instance, 
 you can write
 
   (time (fact 10))
 
 and it will tell you how long it took to compute (fact 10).
 
 The SEQUENCE construct is now known as BEGIN.  Use BEGIN wherever you
 see SEQUENCE and that should work fine.
 
 If you need more help, it would be best if you could get one of your
 course staff to get in touch with us.  It's easier for us to work with 
 just a representative for the course as a whole than to help each
 individual person.
 
 Thanks,
 Shriram
