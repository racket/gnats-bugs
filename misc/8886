Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gcooper" by eli at Mon, 24 Sep 2007 18:38:58 -0400
Reason>>> debugger (probably the one that was recently resolved)


State changed from "open" to "feedback" by gcooper at Tue, 25 Sep 2007 07:39:33 -0400
Reason>>> I believe Robby fixed this in svn a couple of weeks ago.

 Robby -- FYI...
 
 (Greg, in this case it would have been better to also make Robby
 responsible so he'd see the message and close it...)

 I think that it is fixed, but I think that it is probably best to
 verify that and then close it.  (Windows is not easy for me at the
 moment, but I hope to get the windows compiler installed in a few
 weeks.)
