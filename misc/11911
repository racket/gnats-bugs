>Description:
One of my test cases in my Racket->JS compiler appears to fail if I compile the test case with raco make and execute it from the command line.  Here's what I see:


dyoo@thunderclap:~/work/js-sicp-5-5$ raco make test-parse-bytecode-5.1.1.rkt 
dyoo@thunderclap:~/work/js-sicp-5-5$ racket test-parse-bytecode-5.1.1.rkt 
match: no matching clause for (Top (Prefix '()) (CaseLam 'unknown '() 'lamEntry1))

 === context ===
/home/dyoo/local/racket-5.1.1/lib/racket/collects/racket/match/runtime.rkt:19:0: match:error
/home/dyoo/work/js-sicp-5-5/test-parse-bytecode-5.1.1.rkt: [running body]



If I then clear out all of the compiled/ bytecode, and run the test case again, it runs fine:

dyoo@thunderclap:~/work/js-sicp-5-5$ git clean -fd
Removing compiled/
dyoo@thunderclap:~/work/js-sicp-5-5$ racket test-parse-bytecode-5.1.1.rkt 
dyoo@thunderclap:~/work/js-sicp-5-5$ 



This is troubling to me.  I haven't been able to isolate why this is happening.

The commit id is: 5b816c4a64068018f7d40d9dd584be850f72fa11


From a clean checkout at that commit id, execute test-parse-bytecode-5.1.1.rkt from the command line.  It should execute cleanly.  Then, run 'raco make' on it, and try again.  It should then fail with the match error.

 Ugh.  Never mind.  I want to retract this bug report.  I traced the
 difference to how bytecode-compiled programs erase location
 information.
