>Description:
The Perl-compatible regular expression module does not seem to support the "m" style multi-line expression parsing (from the Perl documentation "m	Treat string as multiple lines."

Consequently, the cloister "(?m: ...etc ...)" will always fail during the parsing phase, and I don't see a way to make a regular expression match something like "borfle\nbib.gif\nno"


>How-To-Repeat:
1.  Load the pregexp module into DrScheme.
2.  Attempt to create a multiple-line cloiseter:

(define bar (pregexp "(?m:borfle\n\bib.gif\nno)"))

3.  Fails.
