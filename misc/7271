>Description:
It would be convenient if the module language provided bindings imported with require-for-syntax at the repl, after Run is clicked.  

For example, if the definitions are

(module m mzscheme
  (require-for-syntax "foo.ss"))

at the REPL, the provided bindings from foo.ss would be accessible.

 What if those bindings shadow other top-level module definitions?

 In that case, the non-syntax bindings should probably take precedence.  
 
 Really, this is just a request for a hack to make it convenient to test
 the behavior of a module.  But then, the repl in the module language is
 a similar hack, otherwise it would just do the require before giving you
 the prompt.

 They are. 
 
 Defns:
 
 (module m mzscheme
   (require-for-syntax (lib "list.ss")))
 
 interactions:
 
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 299.33-cvs11mar2005.
 Language: (module ...).
 > (define-syntax (m stx) (begin foldl #'1))
 > (m 1)
 1
 > 
 
 but with this defns:
 
 (module m mzscheme)
 
 the same interactions produces:
 
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 299.33-cvs11mar2005.
 Language: (module ...).

 PS: Please let me know if that answered your question, so I can close
 the PR.

 Yeah, I already understood that such things will work.  A better way to
 phrase the request is this: The repl in the module language gives you an
 easy way to evaluate expressions as if they appeared on the right-hand
 side of a define in the module.  It would be nice to have a similarly
 easy way to evaluate expressions as if they appeared on the right-hand
 side of a define-syntax in the module.  
 
 Probably the specific behavior I was requesting isn't the right way to
 get this, but I still think it would be very useful.
