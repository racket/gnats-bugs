 -3 and 3 are the correct results. `modulo' is a bit confusing that way.
 `remainder' probably has the behavior you're looking for.
 
 See R5RS for details:
 
   http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs_54.html
 
 Note that R5RS contains the following example:
 
  (modulo -13 4)    => 3
  (remainder -13 4) => -1
