>Description:
When stepping though a program, I assume certain expressions should show up to the left of the pause button .. but when they do, they are malformed because only the bottom 1/3 of the text is visible. You can tell something is there, but it is unreadable.

I tried this with the binary v300 Ubuntu build, as well as my own hand-compiled version. Both manifested the same behavior.

>How-To-Repeat:
I was trying the drscheme tour at
http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/tour/tour-Z-H-2.html

In the upper half of the DrScheme window, I typed in
(define (f2c t) (* 5/9 (- t 32)))
(f2c -40)

and pressed the "Debug" button. I stepped until the green arrow is on the closing paren of (- t 32) :

(- t 32)
       ^

To left left hand side of the "pause" button, some expression is printed out, but it is not legible.
