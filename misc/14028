>Description:
Axis ticks are always collapsed when they are "the same," but this does not allow mirroring ticks on the far axis.
Please add parameters such as plot-x-axis-collapse? (and y, z) to opt out of this behavior. I currently have to copy the ticks and apply a minute transform to make them visually the same, but structurally different.
>How-To-Repeat:
The minute transform workaround I wish to avoid:

#lang racket
(require plot)

(parameterize ([plot-y-far-ticks (ticks-scale (plot-y-ticks)
 (linear-scale (/ 99 100)))])
    (plot
     (list (lines '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (4 4) (5 5))))))
