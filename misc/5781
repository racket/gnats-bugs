>Description:
When an application which extends the MzScheme language
(like Swindle) is built, there is no easy way to change the
default flags given to the launcher.  The problem is that
specifications in the info.ss have no way to avoid the `-v'
flag -- all I can get is:

  .../mzscheme" '-qmvL-' 'swindle.ss' 'swindle' ${1+"$@"}

when what I really need is something like:

  .../mzscheme" '-mM' 'swindle.ss' ${1+"$@"}

It seems like the only way to hack around this is by adding
an `install-collection', but that seems like an overkill
for such a minor change.

 FWIW, `install-collection' is exactly how I would expect someone to
 deal with "info.ss" limitations. The built-in install operations are
 intentially as simple as we can make them to cover the common cases.

 Yeah, I know (that's what I'm working on right now...) -- I just
 thought it would be pretty simple to add another option to just change
 the default arguments without going thought the hassle of yet another
 file in the distribution.  (Maybe it is not worth it if this is
 something that nobody else needs to change?)

 Right - I think we've needed maybe one other time in the last few
 years.
