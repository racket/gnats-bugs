Greetings.

Actually it is windows 98 with Visual C++ v6.0 SP1.

I wrote the "hello world" extenstion just the two mandatory functions and folowed the instructions to create the extension. (As mentioned in Inside MzScheme document.)

I did
mzc --cc win32-ext.c
mzc --ld win32-ext.dll win32-ext.obj

Everything went well and the dll was produced. But when I loaded it into DrSchme using (load extention win32-ext.dll) , it complains 

"load-extension: bad version 52 from "c:/dev/scheme/plt-ext/win32-ext" and woudnt load.

Does this mean I have got older libraries or header files?

Here is the Dll dump of the extenstion. I am new to this stuff so I cant find whats wrong with it.

Hope thats sufficient.

I am a professional Windows/C++ developer. So if you need me to do anything else (more reports etc.) I shall be glad to oblige.

I am new to the scheme world. But I can see you guys are doing a great job with DrScheme. Keep up the good work.

 Yes, you have old mzdyn.obj and mzdyn.exp files (our fault - we put
 the wrong files in the distribution bundle).
 
 You can get the correct files from:
 
  ftp.cs.rice.edu/public/mflatt/mzdyn.obj
                            .../mzdyn.exp
 
 Those go in plt/collects/mzscheme/lib/win32/i386/msvc/.
 
 Sorry for the mess. Please let me know if that doesn't fix the
 problem.
 
 Matthew
