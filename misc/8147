>Description:
Using Unicode : 0148 or UTF-8: C5 88 in a slide
converts to an empty space with 

slideshow -P filename.ss

(on a Mac OS X 10.4.6)
when trying to produce .ps file (and .pdf later)
It looks fine when I run the slideshow.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; TestCase for Unicode 0148 or UTF-8 C5 88 character conversion

(module TestCase (lib "slideshow.ss" "slideshow")
  
  (require (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
           (lib "class.ss"))

(slide/center
   (blank)
   (page-para/c (colorize (bt "Computer Science:") "darkgreen"))
   (page-para/c (colorize (bt "Designing Programs for High Schools") "darkgreen"))

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Mon, 17 Jul 2006 14:11:38 -0400
Reason>>> slideshow


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:07 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
