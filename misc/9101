>Description:
Unfortunately this version (352) doesn't start. It loads everything but it dies as as soon as the start screen of drScheme appears. Its the same problem when i try to install it by synaptic or wine, too.

Do you know that problem? How can it be solved?

i am using a intel P4, Ubuntu 7.10, if that helps.

thanks in advance
>How-To-Repeat:
- i start the software
- it crashes after everything is loaded.

Reason>>> 352 is ancient -- please let us know if you get the same 
problem with a more recent version (372, or, preferrabely, 
the version 4.0 pre-release.)
