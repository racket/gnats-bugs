>Description:
Whenever I try to create an executable, I keep getting an error. This is what it says:

split-path: expects argument of type <path (for any platform) or string>; given #<struct:object:text%>

Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks in advance,

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 09 May 2008 15:36:41 -0400
Reason>>> (probably to be closed)



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:16 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
