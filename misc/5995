>Description:
After the error in the test suite window (see previous bug
report), the windows on my screen are
- original DrScheme
- test suite
- PLT Standard Output 
- DrScheme Internal Error popup

While the Internal Error popup is on screen, I cannot
access the DrScheme window!  This is despite their being
two separate applications (or so I would think).  In
particular, then, I can't get to Help easily fire off
a Help Desk to report the bug!

Killing the popup makes the DrScheme window accessible.

    I'm sorry that Windows has confused you. They are one app and
    a modal dialog takes over all of the apps windows.
