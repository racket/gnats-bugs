I having a serious problem with the software. The program drscheme.exe wont start and ends with an error saying i dont have various .eml files in certain directories. after checking these directories, i found that i the installation process did in fact unpack to 'mising' files. so i have to reinstall the program continuously until it works. when i do reinstall the program to working status, the next time i run it i get the same error. frankly this is pissing me off because i need this software for a computer science class i am currently enrolled in. any and all help will be greatly appreciated.

 Please answer the following questions to help us understand what's
 wrong:
 
 Specifically, what files in which directories did it complain about?
 
 How did you start DrScheme.exe, from the command line or from the
 Program menu?
 
 Did you uninstall before reinstalling?  Did you install the same
 downloaded plt.exe each time, or did you download a fresh copy?  Which
 mirror did you download from?
