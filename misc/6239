 It's not just Inside MzScheme for me. Attempting to build any doc ends
 with
 
  ! Missing \end inserted
  ! Incomplete \if
  do-bye failed.
 
 Anyone know what changed?
 
 [FWIW, I committed a new dateman.tex. Was this already on the release
 to-do list?]

 No, I'll add it.
 
 I guess that means we rebuild manuals.

 Unless I'm going crazy, the framework manual doesn't build at the 
 moment -- there are some undocumented methods. So, we need to rebuild 
 anyway.

 Let me know what files to update, and when things are ready to 
 rebuild.

 I tried rebuilding just the insidemz manual. 
 After successfully building the .dvi file, tex2page 
 failed:
 
 	Output written on insidemz.dvi (70 pages, 334768 bytes).
 	Transcript written on insidemz.log.
 	mzscheme -mvqt iterate-tex2page.scm -- insidemz
 	This is TeX2page, Version 4r8f (MzScheme 204, unix)
 	(insidemz.t2p (plt.t2p (css.t2p))) (insidemz.tex (pretitl.tex))
 	! Missing \end inserted.
 	! Incomplete \if
 	do-bye failed.
 	Output written on insidemz/insidemz.html (1 page).
 	Transcript written on insidemz/insidemz.hlog.
 	*** TeX2page fatal error! ***
 
 Any ideas?

 This is the {htmlonly} problem previously discussed.
 Replace all occurrences of 
 
 \begin{htmlonly} ... \end{htmlonly} 
 
 in the PLT documents with
 
 \htmlonly ... \endhtmlonly

 I think those were all changed.
 
 Maybe TrashyTeXTools generates the older ones?
