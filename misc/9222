>Description:
If you try to require a module via a relative file reference in a file preprocessed with mztext, it fails since mztext tries to load the module relative to the preprocessor collects directory.  Loading files works normally.

I'm marking this as non-critical as there's a workaround I can use for now (listed in the steps to reproduce), but it'd be nice to have things work appropriately.
>How-To-Repeat:
Three files:

bar.ss
-----
#lang scheme
-----

broken
-----
@(require "bar.ss")
-----

works
-----
@(load "bar.ss")
@(require 'bar)
-----

Run "mztext broken", you get:

default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/Users/sstrickl/plt/collects/preprocessor/bar.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

 === context ===
/Users/sstrickl/plt/collects/preprocessor/pp-run.ss:16:0: run

Run "mztext works", you get no output (and no error) as expected.

 Fixed.  Turns out that I forgot to commit a change that I did for mzpp
 that fixes this.
