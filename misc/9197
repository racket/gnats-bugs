>Description:
Some spelling errors in the scribble collection (note sequences.scrbl 
has 3 on line 166): 

./reference/pairs.scrbl:94:the result, insteda of the final element. The result is a list
./reference/sequences.scrbl:166:       false result if the sequenec should insteda end insteda of
./reference/sequences.scrbl:146:initial value returned by the thunk. The enerator is defined in terms
./reference/sequences.scrbl:128:@scheme[#t], after whcih the sequence ends.}
./reference/sequences.scrbl:134:@scheme[#t], after whcih the sequence ends.}
./scribble/manual.scrbl:745:@scheme[pre-content] insteda of the target section's name.}

The line from sequences is also ill-formed.  The context is:

   The fourth result takes the current element value(s) and 
   returns a true result if the sequence includes the value, 
   and false result if the sequenec should insteda end insteda 
   of including the value.

This should probably be "a false result if the sequence should 
end instead of including the value", ie. plus "a", minus one 
"insteda".  Also, maybe "false" should be used instead of 
"a false result" -- or are there non-#f "false results"?
