 Is there possibly more than one #lang declaration? What is the program
 that causes this error?
 
 
 I can reproduce it with:
 
 #lang racket
 #lang slideshow
 
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.3.0.20 [3m].
 Language: racket [custom].
 Module Language: invalid module text
 . . read: #lang not enabled in the current context
 
 
 
 
 A program with just #lang slideshow seems to be working?

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Sat, 08 Sep 2012 15:30:37 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sat, 08 Sep 2012 15:30:37 -0400
Reason>>> It's unclear whether there's a bug here or not, and there is
no valid email, so no clarifications would come...
