This is the intended behavoir for archsys. It should return
sparc-solairs-motif only when the PLTEXTENSION envionment variable is
set to -motif.

Did you run `install' after unpacking the plt directory. One of two
things is probably the source of the problem: 1) The installation
directions are misleading or wrong, so that you didn't know running
`install' is required for the Motif version, or 2) The `install'
script is broken; it is supposed to make a link from sparc-solaris to
sparc-solairs-motif if the former does not exist and the latter does.
