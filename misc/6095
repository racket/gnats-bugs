>Description:
The pregexp procedure in pregexp.ss signals an error when
attempting to compile from character class syntax in which
"-" immediately follows the opening "[".

Temporary workaround is to put the "-" immediately before
the closing "]", although that is less portable to similar
regexp syntaxes.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "pregexp.ss" "mzlib"))
(pregexp "[a-z-]")
=> (:sub (:or (:seq (:one-of-chars (:char-range #\a #\z) #\-))))
(pregexp "[-a-z]")
*ERROR* car: expects argument of type <pair>; given ()
