>Description:
The documentation for pregexp.ss at
<http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/205/html/mzlib/mzlib-Z-H-27.html#node_sec_27.3.4>
states the following regarding pregexp-match-positions and
pregexp-match:

  The number of submatches returned is always equal to the
  number of subpatterns specified in the regexp, even if a
  particular subpattern happens to match more than one
  substring or no substring at all.

However, it appears that if a subpattern is part of another
subpattern that fails to match, a submatch is not returned
for the nested subpattern.

(Fortunately, MzScheme's built-in regexp-match-positions
appears to work correctly.)

>How-To-Repeat:
The following is a transcript from DrScheme's Interactions
Window illustrating the problem.  Note that the number of submatches returned by
pregexp-match-positions differs even though the same regular
expression is used each time.  The result of calling
regexp-match-positions is included simply for comparison.

Welcome to DrScheme, version 205.
