>Description:
i installed 100alpha4 fine, and drscheme ran fine.

then i downlaoded mrspidey.ply and used setup-plt mrspidey.plt to install 
and that hosed the complete drscheme -- it wont finish initializing anymore 
(see error below).

it seems to get stuck at unit.ss  here:

  (import [wx : wx^]

Version mismatch problem. We should have put MrSpidey 100alpha4
on the web page.

 We were a bit sloppy with the 100alpha4 distribution pages, and forgot
 to include the latest version of MrSpidey. The old version of MrSpidey
 doesn't work with the latest DrScheme. (Of course, it would have been
 nice if the installer gave you a version-mismatch error...)
 
 We're releasing the final version 100 on Monday, August 9th. The
 correct version of MrSpidey will be available at that time.
 
 Thanks for your report,
 Matthew
