Error:
define-compound-unit/infer: untagged initialization dependent signature mred^ is supplied from a later unit with link temp3

Even the turtle-test.ss does not work.

Also, in the doc it is written:
(require graphics/value-turtle-examples)
but it should be:
(require graphics/value-turtles-examples)
>How-To-Repeat:
simply:
(require graphics/turtles)

sometimes it does not say anything, but adding :
(turtles)
shows an error

I removed units (they weren't necessary; they were added there back before we had module and units where the main structuring mechanism for code)

I'm not sure if this was a type error, but probably it was (also a contract error).

 Is this something we should try to fix for the release?
 
 (The error message looks familiar. Does anyone know what it is, or
 should I look into it?)

 I couldn't figure out the unit system error and the files seemed to
 depend on an undocumented export from mred (which may or may not have
 been the source of the error, I wasn't sure), so I just removed the
 units.
