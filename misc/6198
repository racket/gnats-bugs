>Description:
If I write to a file with (fprintf port ... ), then I must make sure the file ends in a newline, or I lose the last line.  Or else, make sure to close the file with 
close-output-port.  The documentation does not explain that either is needed.  

Of course, "end file with newline" problems are from the bad old days. 
>How-To-Repeat:
drscheme &

Paste these 3 lines of code into Untitled window and execute:

(define porty (open-output-file "busted-newline"))

(fprintf porty "here's one line, which we'll get~n")

(fprintf porty "no newline here")


The file busted-newline contains the first line but not the second.  

I can fix this problem in two ways:  Either add another line of code

(close-output-port porty)

or add a newline to the last fprint command, i.e.

(fprintf porty "no newline here~n")

 It's not really an "end file with newline" problem, but an I/O
 buffering problem.
 
 Technically, this is documented if you follow enough "see also" links
 from the indexed `open-output-file' entry in the MzScheme manual, but I
 certainly don't claim that it's obvious. Section 11.1.5 of the MzScheme
 manual provides the details.

 Thanks, Matthew.  I'm a complete newbie at writing to
 files. t-y-scheme says
 
      After you have performed I/O on a port, you should close it with
      close-input-port or close-output-port.
 
 and that's all I needed to know.

 I agree it's not obvious, I still can't figure it out!  I'll try again
 tomorrow when I have more time.
