>Description:
The plt/install script in CVS is slightly broken: it attempts to write
the appropriate value for PLTHOME into the bin/mzscheme and (I think)
bin/mred scripts.  Only one catch: those aren't scripts, they're
actual binary executables.  The resulting files don't execute.

Easy enough workaround:
./install
cd src; make install  ## re-creates binaries correctly
bin/setup-plt

>How-To-Repeat:
cvs checkout plt
cd plt/src
./configure
make
make install
cd ..
./install
