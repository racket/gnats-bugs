 Do we want to have the installer delete those files?
 
 Won't users want their settings preserved across releases?

 Hm. Generally, I'd say yes, but that conflicts with the idea that
 uninstalling actually removes everything.
 
 There seem like there are really three operations we want to support:
 
   - install fresh
 
   - upgrade 
     this consists of two steps: clean up and install.
 
   - uninstall
 
 Right now, the uninstall we have is, in some sense, the "clean up" step
 for the upgrade step. I think that we should instead make the uninstall
 really erase everything. Then, we can have the installer try to detect
 old installations (via registry keys or prompting the user or both?)
 and ask the user about upgrading an existing installation or installing
 fresh.

 Would you be happy for 200 if the uninstaller rips out those files?
 
 If so: what is the algorithm to find them?  Does it differ by Windows
 version?

 Uninstall should remove all system wide settings. But how about personal
 mred files?
