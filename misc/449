 We're having trouble understanding your problem. Are you using
 DrScheme (where C-c C-e and C-c C-f aren't bound) or MzScheme with
 some other editor (but MzScheme doesn't have any graphics)?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I'm using Mzscheme with a graphics extension loaded.It says 
 "Welcome to Mzscheme....actually Mred with editor disabled "

 Where did this come from? Not from PLT web pages, I think. Is it
 something local at UNM? 
 
 Moving on, what platform are your running on and how much memory does
 it have?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Yes,this is for a class at UNM.We are running on an AIX platform,but
 i have no idea as to the size of the memory for the Unix machine.

 It's difficult to know what the problem might be since I'm unfamiliar
 with the way that you're running MrEd or the kinds of programs you are
 running. Perhaps your instructors can help you narrow down the problem
 to give us more information?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
