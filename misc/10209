This could have been a contract violation if the contracts in the docs were connected to the source code. Similarly, it could have been a type error.

 Looks like the docs were correct. The sz parameter is used later in
 the code to be a size of the (non-existent) arrowheads.
 
 I've committed a fix, but you'll need to remove the extra 0 in your code no=
 w.
