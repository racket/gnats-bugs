Likewise, /plt/src/mzscheme/src/Makefile mentions gmp/gmp.c
which is missing. The CVS repository doesn't seem to contain
any directory named 'gmp'

 A CVS mystery...
 
 The "gmp" directory is really there, and the command line you provide
 works for me in a fresh directory.
 
 Does
 
   cd plt/src/mzscheme/src
   cvs update -d -r v200 gmp
 
 work any better?

 Hello!
 
 A CVS mystery indeed -- but solved.
 > cvs update -d -r v200 gmp
 
 worked out. The flag -d was crucial. The flag has an unfortunate side
 effect (mentioned on the man pages), therefore, I didn't use the -d flag
 when I did "cvs update" from the top directory. I used "cvs status" to
 check for potential updates as common; alas, cvs status does not have
 an equivalent -d flag and does not tell about new directories in the
 repository. 
 
 	BTW, I have found another mystery -- with the file plt/install
 plt/src/README still recommends to run plt/install after the
 compilation of mzscheme. However, plt/install is missing from the v200
 release:
 File: install           Status: Up-to-date
  
    Working revision:    1.10
    Repository revision: 1.10    /home/scheme/Archives/AnonCVS/plt/install,v
    Sticky Tag:          exp (revision: 1.10)
    Sticky Date:         (none)
    Sticky Options:      (none)
 As you see, it is tagged only with the 'exp' tag (but not v200 tag). I
 remember the file was there. I was surprised when I found that the
 file disappeared after "cvs update -r v200"
 
 	Cheers,
 	Oleg

 It's v200-tagged, now. Thanks for letting me know.
