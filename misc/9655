>Description:
The documentation SRFI 62: S-expression comments still has the code sample:

(require srfi/62)

at the top. If you try requiring it, you get the error:

open-input-file: cannot open input file: "C:\PLT-4\collects\srfi\62.ss" (The system cannot find the file specified.; errno=2)

because this functionality is part of the language now. That require code should be removed.

saying that no require is needed.)
