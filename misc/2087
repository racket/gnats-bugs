>Description:
1. I have my data and i store it in a file, then after i read the data, why all the word become small capital letters?

2. I want to make a counter function, so everytimes i run the program, it increasing by 1. How i make that function ? can you send me the code ? is there any temporary variable name like in c++ ?

3. Why if i want to save my list to a file, it can't use the same filename with the filename in my loading data function ? Can you explain me how to save a list to a file ?

Thank You

 That's the way the Scheme printer works.

 You should pick up an introductory Scheme book to learn how to devise
 such a thing.  Or ask your instructor :-)

 You haven't said how you're opening the files.  But my guess is you
 first need to close the port associated with reading the file before you
 can write to it.
