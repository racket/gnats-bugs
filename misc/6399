>Description:
Anton vS explained that JMS's "some" function is PLT's "ormap"
function.  But the docs have a typo.  Searching for "ormap" gives:

Intermediate Student Language
ormap in "ormap"

Intermediate Student with Lambda Language
ormap in "ormap"

Advanced Student Language
ormap in "ormap"

All 3 say:


purpose: 
(ormap p (list x-1 ... x-n)) = (or (p x-1) (and ... (p x-n)))

That's supposed to be 

(ormap p (list x-1 ... x-n)) = (or (p x-1) (or ... (p x-n)))

I know this because HtDP says:

;; ormap : (X  ->  boolean) (listof X)  ->  boolean
;; to determine whether p holds for at least one item on alox
;; that is, (ormap p (list x-1 ... x-n)) = (or (p x-1) (or ... (p x-n)))
(define (ormap p alox) ...)

 ?
 
 Why not
 
 (ormap p (list x-1 ... x-n)) = (or (p x-1) ... (p x-n))
 
 or
 
 (ormap p (list x-1) = (p x-1))
 (ormap p (list x-1 ... x-n)) = (or (p x-1) (ormap p (list x-2 ... x-n)))
 
 
 
 The first looks better, the second one doesn't enforce the 
 verify-boolean on the last argument.
 
 But the one that Bill Richter quotes uses ellipses in a weird way and 
 isn't recursive.
 
 Please ignore if your change already does this.
