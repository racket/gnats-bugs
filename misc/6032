windows-9x
>Description:
After running the plt-202.exe on our Win98 machine we have plenty of problems 
with infected .exe files.
The installation itself succeded.

The plt-202.exe was downloaded from the Tuebingen archive in Germany. 

To fix the problem I would propose you get in touch with the maintainer of that archive. Checking the other mirror sites would be in order, I guess.


>How-To-Repeat:
Download plt-202.exe for Windows 98 from Tuebingen, and run it.

 I've forwarded your message to the maintainer
 of the Tuebingen archive.
 
 I think it's very unlikely the main archive in the 
 USA is infected, since it resides on a Linux machine.
 
 By the way, the confirmation message for your report
 bounced, because you had entered two email addresses, 
 not just one.

 Mike Sperber says the archive at Tuebingen is 
 identical to the one in the USA.
 
 Also, the archive in the USA has "read-only" 
 permissions, so it's extremely unlikely that 
 it could have been infected, particularly 
 since it resides on a Linux machine.
 
 Could some other program have infected your 
 system?
