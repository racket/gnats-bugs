Mac PowerPC
>Description:
For 2 times, I downloaded the Mac PPC version 50. No problem with
MacBinary, got the hqx archive. Unstuff successfully, BUT the 
plt:DrScheme:DrScheme is not an application, but a document only,
with no creator : when double-clicking on it, I get "Cannot find an
application to open this document".
Once I got a colored icon, but with the same symptom described above.
The other time, I got only a document icon, just like other files in the
directory DrScheme.

Downloaded through Netscape.

The Win95 version works fine.

 DrScheme is indeed not an application: it is a document for an
 application called "MrEd". Please consult the installation
 instructions at:
  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/download//help/installmac.html
 
 [For the next release of the PLT software, DrScheme *will* be an
 actual application, ending the current confusing situation.]
