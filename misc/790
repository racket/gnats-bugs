The command

(require-library "compiled/trace.zo")

fails to load the trace macros correctly.  It fails in three different
environments.

1. On a solaris 2.7 version of DrScheme, compiled from source code
last week or so by Mike Markowski at the University of Delaware with the
help of Mathew Flatt, the above command produces the error message

/opt/lib/plt/collects/mzlib/compiled/trace.zo: 1.1-1.2: invalid # syntax

The command (require-library "compiled/tracec.zo") produces the same 
error message.

2. On a solaris 2.5 version using the binaries compiled at Rice, the
error message is

reference to undefined  identifier: begin

The command (require-library "compiled/tracec.zo") loads trace so that
it can be used, but the load process takes about 18 seconds on my Sparc 5.

3. On my laptop, using the Windows 95 version binaries downloaded from
Rice, the behavior is the same as on the solaris 2.5 version.

The command (require-library "trace.ss") works in DrScheme in all
three environments, so I can trace procedures when I want to; it just
takes a long time to load the trace macro.

All of the require-library commands I have mentioned work in MzScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
After bringin g up DrScheme, type the following in the lower window:

(require-library "compiled/trace.zo")

 Quoting chester@cis.udel.edu:
 > (require-library "compiled/trace.zo")
 
 Use
 
   (require-library "trace.ss")
 
 instead. If compiled/trace.zo exists and *can be used*, it will be
 used automatically.

 DrScheme can't use .zo files, so when you give it the choice (by
 requiring "trace.ss" instead of "compiled/trace.zo"), DrScheme avoids
 .zo files and things work.
 
 DrScheme in "R4RS+" mode is slow. We're working on that and the
 problem with .zo files. Meanwhile, there's not much you can do, except
 wait or use the "MrEd" language. You'll find that DrScheme in "MrEd"
 mode is about as fast as MzScheme and it will use .zos files, but you
 won't get source hilighlighting when something goes wrong.

 Shouldn't this be an error from require-library?
 
 Also, should this be in the faq? (He can switch language levels for
 speed....)
