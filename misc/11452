 No, the documentation is correct. Uninterned symbols are not held by the 
 internal symbol table at all. The point is that even interned symbols 
 can be collected:
 
  > (define b
      (make-weak-box '|You've never seen this before!|))
  > (weak-box-value b)
 '|You've never seen this before!|

 Ah that makes sense. Currently how it is phrased makes it seem that the =
 internal symbol table might hold something strongly, which made me think =
 that it was misprint.
