 What error are you getting, and what (exactly!) are you doing to get
 it?  Programs that start with #lang slideshow work just fine for me,
 and for many other people.

 This is the problem.  If you look in Section 2 of the Quick intro [1],
 you'll see this:
 
   If you’ve used DrRacket before, you might need to reset DrRacket to use the
   language declared in the source via the Language|Choose Language... menu
   item before clicking Run.

 Probably the student languages should explicitly search for this kind of
 error and bring up a dialog box offering to change the language.
