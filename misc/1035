>Description:
In help-desk without any manuals installed, going to installed manuals list a bunch of
Uninstalled Manuals.  Clicking on any one of these downloads it and installs it for you
(assuming you click "download and install"), except for the framework docs.  They download
and end up in the docs/framework collection, but they don't appear in the Installed Manuals
as installed.  Searching for frame:basic% links to the appropriate framework help page,
though.

 Somehow, the file "index.htm" in the docs file didn't make it. It
 should be a copy of the "index.html" file in that directory
 (plt/collects/doc/framework). For now, just make the copy yourself.
