>Description:
(as above)

>How-To-Repeat:
set language to "Graphical MrEd"
enter some thing in the definition frame, for example:
 (define (fib x) (if (< x 2) x (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2)))))
 (fib 3)
press "analyze"
an r5rs dialog warning will appear,
 if "OK" is pressed, analsis will occure.
 if the "return key" is pressed nothing happens, even though "OK"
 should be the defalut responce to a return, as it is highlited as such.

(also notice that when analyzed, the "<" primative is incorrectly
 identiyed as bing unknown?)
