>Description:
   Got the error msgs below when searching PLT MzScheme Language manual with
   release 53 of DrScheme Win95 PC:

   ivar/proc: expects type <object> as 1st argument, given: #f; other
     arguments were: set-focus

   error trying to display error: exception raised: ivar: instance variable
     not found: file-menu:quit in class: dialog-box%

   Came about when I used the help menu item "MZScheme lang manual", then did
   FIND from the Edit menu while viewing the manual page

>How-To-Repeat:
I entered the keyword
   "hash" in search window which appeared at bottom of window.  Search failed
   (even tho word "hash" is there) I then went to hash page node38.html,
   tried search for "hash", failed again even tho word "hash" is there, and
   got above error when I tried to close the seacrh window.

   FYI: I've gotten similar behavior after breaking DrScheme evaluations in the
   middle of long outputs, but haven't had time to documenbt the exact
   circumstances.
