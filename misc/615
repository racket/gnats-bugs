>Description:
Easier to show than to explain.  See below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following in the DrScheme definition window:

(define parse-bind*
  (lambda (bl-list env)
    (unless (null? bl-list)
      (hash-add env (caar bl-list)
		(parse-RE (cadar bl-list)))
      (parse-bind* env (cdr bl-list)))))

;; Parses a single RE
;; INPUT: lot: list of tokens
;; RETURNS: abstract syntax representation for the RE represented by lot
;; EFFECTS: none
;; EXCEPTIONS: if syntax error, calls (error ...)


Place the cursor immediately after the final close paren in (error ...)

Note that the entire program is colored gray.
