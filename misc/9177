>Description:
The interactive Window shows the following error upon pushing debug:

"send: target is not an object: #f for method: get-tab"

Seems the same in R5RS or Pretty-Big languages.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gcooper" by eli at Fri, 09 May 2008 15:43:45 -0400
Reason>>> debugger


State changed from "open" to "feedback" by gcooper at Fri, 09 May 2008 15:49:04 -0400
Reason>>> I think I fixed this a couple of months ago.  Has this
problem occurred in versions more recent than March 4, 2008
(r8867)?


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 14:58:52 -0500
Reason>>> probably fixed
