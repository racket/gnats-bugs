>Description:
Beyond the error below (which is the real bug report), there is a link that appears in the macro stepper window that invites clicking, but nothing happens when I click it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the program below in te graphical language and get this error:

wderiv-e1: expected argument of type <deriv>; given #f
