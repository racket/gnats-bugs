 Matthias,

 Actually, this remarkable technical feat has very nearly been achieved.  It
 waits until I actually run DR Scheme before changin the icon, but it remains
 changed until I reboot.  If you change the install program so that it starts
 and closes Dr Scheme upon booting up, you may succeed.  It would be
 preferable, however, to include this undocumented feature as an option.
 
 Seriously, though, it is a little disconcerting when basic windows icons
 start to change.  Especially since I also have the (since reported)
 additional problem that after running and closing Dr Scheme, I am unable to
 run it again without rebooting, which is a bit more frustrating than the
 icon thing.
 
 Cheers
 
 Tom

 Now, I for one intend to take random behavior more seriously because I
 intend to become a good deal more ungovernable than I already am.

 Doesn't happen under NT 4.0.
