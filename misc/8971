>Description:
The ProfJ class wizard signals an error on "startup".  It looks
like an easy fix, where the contract expects a language and is
actually called with a string:

#<path:/Users/clements/plt/collects/profjWizard/tool.ss> broke the contract 
  (case->
    (->
     (values
       boolean?
       (or/c
        false/c
        (cons/c
          "<Class>"
          (cons/c
            boolean?
            (cons/c boolean? null?))))))
    (->
     "<Language>"
     (values
       boolean?
       (or/c
        false/c
        (cons/c
          "<Class>"
          (cons/c
            boolean?
            (cons/c boolean? null?)))))))
on get-class-info; expected <<Language>>, given: "Advanced"

 === context ===
/Users/clements/plt/collects/mzlib/private/contract-guts.ss:199:2: raise-contract-error
/Users/clements/plt/collects/profjWizard/tool.ss:54:12: A
/Users/clements/plt/collects/mred/private/mrmenu.ss:237:17: command method in basic-selectable-menu-item%
call-with-break-parameterization



So the real question here is:  did the contract save effort by catching an error with a better error message, or is this an instance where the code is correct but the contract needs to be updated?

 I wanted to disable the Wizard for Advanced until I had the  
 privileges right. This is why there is a check at all.
 
 Robby: The string-based method worked fine until recently. Did I  
 overlook a drscheme announcement (change to API?)

 I doubt you overlooked an announcement. I don't recognize
 get-class-info, tho, and there doesn't seem to be anything in help
 desk about it, so maybe you should be looking elsewhere for
 announcements of interface changes?
