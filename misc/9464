The following error shows up if one tries to pass multiple arguments to drscheme from the command line:

dyoo@kfisler-ra1:~/work/function-table$ drscheme *.ss
slideshow: expects at most one module file, given 16: ("cell.ss" "column-snip.ss" "delayed-listener-text-mixin.ss" "editor-stream-utils.ss" "foo.ss" "function-table.ss" "image-snip-equal.ss" "info.ss" "interface.ss" "lockable-text.ss" "my-sandbox.ss" "teacher-evaluator-lang.ss" "test-examples.ss" "test-range.ss" "tool.ss" "value-snips.ss")

 This doesn't happen for me. 
 
 It is maybe something in one of the files? Perhaps a snip that triggers
 auto-loading of some class that uses `slideshow'?
 
 Thanks,

 How curious!  You're right, one of the files in my directory contained a 
 slideshow snip.  Sorry for the false alarm.

 Well, it's not so much a "false alarm" as a "different alarm". So we
 have a bug in Slideshow snip handling...
 
 Can you remind me how to create such a snip?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I could not reproduce the situation that I was seeing earlier.  I
 probably screwed up while coding up one of my snip classes.

 Did this get resolved? I see from the audit trail that Matthew asked a
 question, but not if Danny answered:

 Oh. Still, quite a strange error, no? :)
 
 I'll close the PR.
