Using \today in the preamble of the latex file will produce not the desired date but converts the year to currentyear-1900.

So 2006 becomes 106.

I didn't find any email adress of Dorai Sitraram so tried this way.

 Does PLT Scheme produce the same kind of error? That's the one we're 
 responsible for.
 
 As far as I know, Dorai doesn't work for guile either, but I'll forward 
 it to him. -- Matthias

 I didn't try it in PLT Scheme but just used the command line interface
 of tex2page. However thanks for forwarding the mail. :)
 
 
 Greetings from germany,
