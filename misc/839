System: Linux piccadilly-circus 2.0.33 #16 Thu Aug 27 15:32:49 CDT 1998 i586 unknown
Architecture: i586

>Description:

Sometimes the canvas% method user-min-width raises an exception that prints 
this message:

  min-width: value out-of-range 200 to 10000: 36

The two problems I see with this are:

1) the method name of the error message is wrong and the class is omitted, and
2) the range for user-min-width should be from 0 to the largest pixel index 
possible.

Also, once while I was doing this, mred crashed and killed my entire
machine. Another time, mred merely crashed itself. This may have been a bug 
with copy/pasting. The time the entire machine died I was pasting from an
xterm with the middle button; the time it only killed mred, I was copying
and pasting from mred with the edit menu. 

>How-To-Repeat:

I cannot build a small example because mred keeps dying (and my machine
kernel panic-ed after mred kill it last time so I'm not about to even
try...) However, here is the errortrace.ss trace:

[Thu 03 Dec] ~> mred -L framework.ss framework -e "(error-print-width 500)" -e '(send (make-object (frame:info-mixin frame:searchable%) "test") show #t)'
min-width: value out-of-range 200 to 10000: 36
  ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote min-client-width)) gc-width) in /home/robby/plt/collects/framework/frame.ss
  (#%let-values (((send*317) gc-canvas)) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote min-client-width)) gc-width) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote min-client-height)) gc-height) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote stretchable-width)) #f) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote stretchable-height)) #f)) in /home/robby/plt/collects/framework/frame.ss

gc-canvas is just a regular canvas% object.
