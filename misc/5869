>Description:
The provide form is available in the EoPL language, even though the module form isn't. This leads to the (confusing) error
  provide: not in module body
instead of the expected
  reference to undefined identifier: provide
>How-To-Repeat:
Set language to EoPL.

(module a mzscheme
  (provide b)
  (define b null))

Click Execute.
