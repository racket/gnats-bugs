>Description:
Though it's mentioned in the comments of foreign.ss, there is no mention that the pre: and post: entries of a custom _fun type can be of the form (id => expr) in the documentation.  It would be nice to add a note on the syntax of pre: and post: to the PLT Foreign Interface Manual, Section 3.5.1.
