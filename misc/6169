>Description:
Including (set! <identifier>) subpatterns in a 
($ <struct> <pat> ...) pattern gives the following error: 

string-append: expects type <string> as 2nd argument, given: #<syntax:192:16>; other arguments were: "set-" "!" 
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-struct Animal (species))

(define jaguar (make-Animal 'jaguar))

;; This works

(match jaguar [($ Animal (get! get-species))
               (get-species)])

> jaguar

;; This does not work

(match jaguar [($ Animal (set! set-species))
               (set-species 'cheetah)])
