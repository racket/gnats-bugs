 I tried this in both stock v203 (Windows) and the current CVS code
 (Solaris) and didn't get an error.
 
 You just entered the four letters `make', nothing else?
 
 Anything unusual about your setup?

 Can you try
 
  - mv'ing the add-on packages outside the plt/collects/ directory
  - re-running the search
 
 I'm guessing the error will disappear.
 
 If so, mv each package back one by one, running the search
 after each mv.  In that case, which package triggers the 
 error?
 
 If you can find such a package, please send me its doc.txt file.
 I'm assuming these packages have a doc.txt file, and not 
 a manual in plt/collects/doc/.

 Hi Paul,
 
 I downloaded a new copy of 203 and installed everything I have right now
 
 but I get no error and I don't know what's different. It's really 
 strange. Maybe just a problem with my system. I'll check this problem 
 better tomorrow and If I find something new I'll let you know.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Paulo
