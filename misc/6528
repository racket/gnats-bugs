>Description:
After running the above demo and then closing the graphics window, quick clicks
in the definition's window frame scroll bar area to scroll up or down to the
next text sections are no longer recognized; the mouse must be held down for
some period of time prior to the click being recognized.

It seems that the event filter looses mouse clicks, and only recognizes mouse
down state after running the demo for some reason; simular to how the menu
often doesn't recognize single clicks on menu selections until the mouse is
subsequenty moved?

>How-To-Repeat:
- open frtime/demo7.ss for example.
- select (module...) language.
- click execute
- close graphics window
- single click in an empty scroll bar region of demo7.ss text to scroll down.
- see that it doesn't scroll unless the mouse button is held down for some
  short period of time?
