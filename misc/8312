>Description:
If I understand the documentation correctly, the gunzip-through-ports should eventually read the last char and then send an eof.  This code waits in a read for final char/eof which never comes.
>How-To-Repeat:
create any test.gz with a few chars or numbers, then

(require (lib "inflate.ss"))

;; wrap-gunzip: input-port -> input-port
;; from schemecookbook.org
(define (wrap-gunzip original-ip)
  (define-values (ip op) (make-pipe 32768))
  (thread (lambda () (gunzip-through-ports original-ip op)))
  ip)

;; now read the compressed file:
(call-with-input-file "test.gz"
  (lambda (in)
    (let ((data-port (wrap-gunzip in)))
       (let loop ((next (read data-port)))
         (printf "next: ~a\n" next)
         (cond
           ((eof-object? next) 'done)
           (else
            (loop (read data-port))))))))

 There is no "sending" of an eof -- you need to explicitly close
 ports.  In your case, after the thread is done with its
 `gunzip-through-ports', it dies, and leaves the output side of the
 pipe (its input port) stuck because nobody is feeding its input (its
 output port).  I modified wrap-gunzip to close the port:
 
   ;; wrap-gunzip: input-port -> input-port
   ;; from schemecookbook.org
   (define (wrap-gunzip original-ip)
     (define-values (ip op) (make-pipe 32768))
     (thread (lambda ()
               (gunzip-through-ports original-ip op)
               (close-output-port op))) ; <---------- my addition
     ip)
 
 and things worked as expected.
 
 (CCing Matthew in case I get something wrong, but I'm going to close
 the bug now -- please reopen if needed.)
