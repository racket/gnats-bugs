 I changed the error message in svn -- it should now say:
 
   cleanse-path: `exists' access denied for /home/clements/class/handin/Bogus/clements/ATTEMPT/abc.ss
 
 is this better?
 
 This still exposes the path where you install the server, but I don't
 see much to do about this.  One option is to use only the last part of
 the path, like:
 
   cleanse-path: `exists' access denied for .../abc.ss
 
 but that will be a problem when you'll need to know the actual path.
 Maybe a better solution is to make it a new kind of an exception with
 a field for the path and the ambiguous abbreviated error message.
 This will allow your code (actually the handin-server's code in this
 case) to catch the exception and report the path on the logs, then
 reraise it so the student only sees the short version.
 
 (I'll do this if you think it's worth the effort...)

 I think an error message in terms of `require' would be better. Or
 maybe a message saying "you cannot submit files with require"?

 That's not possible -- it's coming from the sandbox security handler,
 and there's no way to know where is the request coming from (actually,
 there is a `who' argument -- that's the `cleanse-path' below).
 
 
 > Or maybe a message saying "you cannot submit files with require"?
 
 Unrelated to what I suggested -- this does seem like a good idea.  It
 can probably be implemented by making a language (based on plai in
 John's case) that redefines `require' as a macro that throws an
 appropriate error.
