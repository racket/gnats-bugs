With this invokation:

  (run (lambda (x y z) (+ 1 (modulo y 8))))

the elevator goes thru floors "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7,
8....". However, I would have expected "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 1 ...".

   With this invokation:
 
     (run (lambda (x y z) (+ 1 (modulo y 8))))
 
   the elevator goes thru floors "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7,
   8....". However, I would have expected "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
   5, 6, 7, 8, 1 ...".
 
 I have read over the description of the elevator and decided that the
 behavior is normal. The elevator's behavior is adaptive. As it moves
 it uses its software to recompute the next goal based on the current 
 status: direction, current floor (that it is passing), list of demands. 
 
 Consider it's move downwards. When it passes the 7th floor it calls the
 next function with the current status to find out whether it should stop
 there or move on. Robby's function says: move to current floor (7) plus 1
 mod 8 (or something like that), which is 8. So the elevator goes back to
 8. 
 
 Here is a controller that give us the behavior that Robby wants: 
 
 (define (next3 x y z)
   (cond
     ((and (eq? 'up x) (< y 8)) (+ y 1))
     ((eq? 'up x) 7) ; anything down
     ((and (eq? 'down x) (> y 1)) (- y 1))
     (else 2))) ; anything up
 
 Question 1: is there a closed formula that achieves the same effect? 
 
 Question 2: Is it worth my while to turn this into a problem for
 conditional reasoning? 
 
 ;; ---
 
 I noticed that on several invocations of the elevator half the black and
 white lines don't show up. Is it worth pursuing this so that we get our
 color table fixed? 
 
 ;; ---
 
 Can someone close the PR for me please? I am still not into editing these
 things. Thanks!

 Why does the controller get called with "7" when it just returned "1"? It
 seems confusing that the last output from the function is not the next
 input to the function. But, I see what's going on.

 This is probably not a color table problem (black and white are always
 there, unlessmred is really in sad state), but it could be a problem caused 
 by the event-loop re-arrangement that we did.
 
 Ted saw something like that too, and I'm guessing that you and he saw the
 same thing.

 You want the controller called with the current state not the current
 goal. Say the elevator is at 1, you're at 10, and the next goal is 50. 
 You certainly want the elevator to stop at 10 and drop you off at 20;
 you don't want to wait until it has served 50.

 Yeah, you are right.
