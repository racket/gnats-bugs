>Description:
DrScheme is really a excellent scheme implementation. I find many people like it, expecially our students. However, students also find that it is too large. You know that most docs can be found on the PLT-Scheme homepage. So most of them don't think it is necessary to install these docs on their local computers. And many of them are the PortableApp(or USB app) fans. And they told me that they hope they can have a lite version of DrScheme in their USB so that they can learn scheme everywhere without installing the large DrScheme everytime. I think this is a good suggestion. So i send this report to you and expecting you make it. Thanks.

 I considered making such a thing a while ago -- it would take just a
 little work to cut some stuff off.  The docs are easy, but the
 collections are not that easy.  In any case, that was back at the time
 when a 512MB flash stick was a big deal, and a PLT installation of
 ~60MB was pretty heavy for the average flash sizes.  We're now up to
 bigger drives at a reasonable prices (I see <10$ for 512MB, and <40$
 for 4GB), so it seems pointless to spend the effort when this market
 keeps the current trend.

 There is not much that DrScheme can do in this case.  This problem
 will happen with any application on Windows that you may want to
 install on a usb drive.  I think that there are some synchronization
 tools on Windows that allow you to move around some of your data.

 Yes, that is one way around the problem, even though it was not
 desiged for that kind of usage.
