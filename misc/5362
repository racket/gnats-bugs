>Description:
I think this is probably the same bug as 5088.  I think that define-macro is looking for some environment variable that isn't set.  However, there's no way for me to know what variable that is.  If you do a search through the source code for something like this:

(build-path (getenv "somevariable") ...)

you might solve the problem quickly.

>How-To-Repeat:
Here's my program:

(define-macro foo
   (lambda (x y z)
     (+ x y z)))

(considerably simpler than the one in 5088).  I'm just running it in either the interactions window or the definitions window (same error).  However, if its a particular env variable not set on my machine, you will most likely not be able to reproduce it.  

As a side note, let-macro seems to work ("the shortest lie in programming"...)

(let-macro foo
    (lambda (x y z)
      (+ x y z))
    (foo 1 2 3))

returns 6

 What language level were you using? Have you tried the non-debug
 variants? This is probably a known problem with the debug variants that
 has been fixed in our later releases. You can find them at:

 Hope that helps,
