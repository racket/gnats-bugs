>Description:
I followed your 'documentation'.  When I got to the add (provide rainbow square) it did not work. 
a) I placed the 'provide' syntax before and after the #lang slideshow. Before & after the functions in quick.rkt. 
b) Created use.rkt and copied the syntax provided. Both the quick.rkt and use.rkt are in the same file. 
c) error returned upon exec of use.rkt --> expand: unbound identifier in module in: rainbow 

Any hints?  
Thanks!

 Can you provide your quick.rkt and use.rkt files?
