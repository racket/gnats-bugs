>Description:
I am using DrScheme with the text Simply Scheme by Harvey and Wright.
The text requires us to have extra files. The authors rewrote some of the primitives to they would be easier for the beginning student.
I have to load the file simply.scm  everytime I use scheme.
The trouble is that after I change a definition and press execute I have to reload simply.scm. I am not writing anything complicated, just very elementary procedures. It sounds like DrScheme has a memory leak. 

>How-To-Repeat:
(load "simply.scm")

(first 'hat) returns 'h

go up to definitions and do something then press execute.

(first 'hat)

error:undefined variable first.


(load "simply.scm")
(first 'hat)   returns 'h

 Tru putting (load "simply.scm") into the definitions window or 
 contact the authors of the Simple Scheme text and ask them to develop 
 a TeachPack, rather than using `load'.
 
 Hope that helps.
