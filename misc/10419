>Description:
The page
file:///C:/Program%20Files/PLT/doc/html/index.html#%28def._%28%28lib._html/main..ss%29._td%29%29

says stuff like

A Contents-of-pre is either

    *

      G9
    *

      G11

I'm assuming that these are gensyms that should have been replaced by something else.

 Oops, I just didn't search far enough down on the page to find the
 definition of a G2.
 
 It's a pretty crufty name for a datatype, though.  That part is really
 difficult to read.
