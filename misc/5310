>Description:
this is jensen's device (a simple instance of it)
written in the concisest way of writing it, relying 
on the procedure name as a plain variable. i recall
writing the function just like that in my, eh, 
younger days. minor but too bad.

begin 
 
 integer i; 
 
 real procedure Sum(e); 
   real e; 
   begin
     Sum := 0; 
     for i := 0 step 1 until 10 do
       Sum := Sum + e;
   end;
   
 printnln(Sum(i)); 
 
 printnln(Sum(i * i)); 
 
end

 Ok - what's supposed to happen if `Sum' is supplied as a argument to
 another function (i.e., do you get the current value, or the Sum
 procedure)?

 Algol60 doesn't have first-class procedures. In that case, you get the
 value or the LHS value (case-\) for Sum (the stack location).

 Perhaps this is the source of my confusion, but I think it does. In
 particular, the `euler' expample in the report seems to take a
 procedure argument.

 okay i was wrong on this issue. 5.4.4 explicitly states that any occurrence
 of the function name not on the lhs of an assignment denotes an activation 
 of the procedure.
