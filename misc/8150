>Description:
For some reason, include-bitmap is failing only for files of type .bmp. The program included below fails when using "plt.bmp" and succeeds when using "plt.png" -- I've tried this on several files and always see the same thing. For .bmp files I get the error:

delete-file: cannot delete file: "C:\DOCUME~1\dherman\LOCALS~1\Temp\mztmp1151431059379824125" (Permission denied; errno=13)

Note that this is undoubtedly due to some annoying detail of Windows file locking behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module test mzscheme
  (require (lib "include-bitmap.ss" "mrlib"))
  (define x (include-bitmap "plt.bmp")))

Reason>>> This is fixed in SVN.

The problem was that I recently changed the I/O library
used by the BMP reader (to support Unicode paths) and I
didn't pair the right close() function with the open() function.
So, the file wasn't closed.

 Thanks -- I take it this will not make it into a point-release until 
 350.3? I have a planet library that uses include-bitmap, and I need to 
 set the "required-core-version" field in its info.ss.
 
 Thanks,
 Dave
