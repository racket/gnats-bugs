>Description:
I am getting the error below when I do an insert of a decimal number.

query-exec: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Invalid precision value
  SQLSTATE: HY104

Here is the insert:

(query-exec *con* "insert into simple (description, id, name, x) values (?, ?, ?, ?)" "this is a test" 23 "test" 1.7)

I am using SQL Server 2008 and the "SQL Server" ODBC driver.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create this table in a SQL Server DB:
create table simple (
  id int primary key not null,
  [name] varchar(30) default null,
  description varchar(500) default null,
  x decimal(10,2) not null)
2. Set up the ODBC DSN and connect to it.
3. Run the insert specified above.

 I found my problem. I was using the "SQL Server" ODBC driver. It began to work better when I changed the DSN to use the "Native SQL Server" ODBC driver.
 
 Unfortunately, with the native driver it now returns only the integer value, i.e. 2 for 2.5, 23 for 23.1, etc.  (I checked an the value is stored correctly in the DB.)

 I've found the problem with the truncated query results, and I'll push a 
 fix in a moment. I haven't found a way to get the "SQL Server" driver to 
 accept DECIMAL/NUMERIC parameters, but I've found discussions online 
 that suggest that the (non-"Native") "SQL Server" driver has problems, 
 so I'll just add a warning in the docs.
