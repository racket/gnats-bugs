>Description:
After sending the DATA card in SMTP it would be far easier
to use a header list rather a header string to process the
FROM, TO, etc.  You would simply need to change the fprintf
in smtpr.ss for the header string parameter to a for-each
similar to the one for message-lines and the processing
would be far easier overall.  Otherwise for each of the
DATA card segments you have to ensure that there is a crlf
after each one.  In doing so you probably overall perform
more processing than if a list was used.

In that vein, although it is more a SMTP knowledge issue,
if you indicate in the doc.txt that when the SUBJECT DATA
card segment is sent that an additonal crlf need be added
at the end to signal that the body of the message is then
forthcoming, it might help eliminate some bug reports.
Without it you lose the body of the message.  In using the
header list method simply letting people know to either
have a blank list member at the end of the list or doing an
additional fprintf of crlf after processing the header list
would eliminate that as a possible bug report.

 Hi - sorry that it's taken me so long to reply. I finally found time to
 refresh my memory of the SMTP library.
 
 Quoting RDahlstedt@tullib.com:

 The reason for the header-string choice is that the "head.ss" library
 provides general header-string manipulation functions.

 Well, it's certainly possible that a string is not be the best choice
 of representation for RFC 822 headers, but I imagine the manipulation
 overhead is negligible. Perhaps the "head.ss" library should provide
 functions for converting a header to list format and back.

 Here again, client programmers are expected to use the "head.ss"
 library, which takes care of these issues (i.e., a well-formed header
 string ends with an extra CRLF). 
 
 The documentation for "head.ss" says a little more about the format of
 header strings, so perhaps the documentation for `smtp-send-message'
 should more agressively direct the reader to that section.
 
 Thanks for the feedback,
 Matthew
