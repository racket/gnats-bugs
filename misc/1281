BTW, in an attempt to make sure that everything is ok I tried the
games, and it turns out that the card games won't start - but I saw
that it behaves the same on the redhat5.2 and also with v.100 it's the
same, so I suppose that this is know. (?)

 Blackjack seems to work in 101 on the mac (in fact, I had tested this
 before the release if you recall).

 The card games work on FreeBSD and my RH 5.2 system, too.

Probably an Exceed problem. Eli wrote:

 Anyway, I click one of the card game buttons and I get the small
 window with the title of "Please Wait" which insists on being too
 narrow but doesn't mind growing vertically and nothing in it - this
 window's title keeps blinking rapidly as if it is constantly getting
 redrawn but nothing happened (I tried waiting for about ten minutes).
 
It's possible that MrEd is wasting all its cycles trying to make
a window a size that the WM doesn't approve of. I'll track down
a Windows-based X server to check.

 I have StarNet XWin32.  Running the games panel
 on Solaris, I'm able to start several of the
 games without incident.
