>Description:
I wrote a simple function in Beginning Student language, with three test cases created using "Insert Test Case".  When I hit "Run", the second and third got check marks, but the first didn't.  When I changed the first to be incorrect, it got a red X, but when I changed it back to correct, it got nothing.  I re-ordered the test cases, and it's always the FIRST one that doesn't get marked.
>How-To-Repeat:
; choose-2 : num -> num
(define (choose-2 num)
  (/ (* num (- num 1)) 2))
"Examples of choose-2:"
; three test cases: (choose-2 4) should be 6, (choose-2 2) should be 1, (choose-2 3) should be 3, all on one line
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 27 Mar 2007 17:45:11 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 27 Mar 2007 17:45:11 -0400
Reason>>> The test boxes are no longer maintained, and have
been removed from the distribution.

 The test cases are now obsolete.
