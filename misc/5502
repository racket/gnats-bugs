>Description:
There seems to be some dependency between either the file's
path or content, and DrScheme's willingness to display the
newly selected file contents, when selecting between my files,
and either collects, or teachpack files; resulting in the newly
selected file being correctly updated in the "open recent..."
list, and window title, but not being displayed in the definitions
window pane.

>How-To-Repeat:
open a few files from valid PLT directories such as from collects,
and teachpacks, and define a directory outside the root plt directory
and save a few .ss files there, attempt to randomly "open recent..."
files, see what occasionally happens.

 The problem more specifically appears to only exist when the preference
 "reuse existing frames when opening new files" is checked, so in summary:
 
 With "reuse exiting frames..." un-checked (disabled):
 - a new window is open, or exiting window brought to front appropriately
   for each file selected on "open recent" menu list.
 - the order of the files on the "open recent" menu list is only updated
   when a new window is opened to display a non-previously open file.
 
 With "reuse existing frames..." checked (enabled):
 - the exiting frame content frame area is not always updated with the file
   selected from the "open recent" file list, although the window title is.
   (for me the problem only expressed itself when the file selected is from
    a directory within the PLT distribution, i.e. collects, teachpack, etc.)
 - and order of the "open recent" files list is however always updated, if
   a window already containing the file is not already open, otherwise the
   the file selected is placed at the top of the list regardless of if its
   contents was properly updated in the window's definition editor frame
   area, which I guess seems reasonable as it in theory is always having to
   re-open the file selected for display, unless another window containing
   it was already open.

 I have also observed this bug, except that I was using the "Open 
 Here..." menu option.  However, this was also OS X.  Maybe there's a 
 return code somewhere that Mr/Mz is ignoring?
 
 To summarize my experience
 1) type junk in empty window
 2) choose "Open Here..."
 3) choose file
 4) window title and tiny popdown menu title change, but _not_ defn's 
 window content.
 
 5) yikes! close window.  be very careful not to click on "save" in 
 confirmation dialog.
