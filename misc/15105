>Description:
The docs for odbc-data-source in the db library have the function taking a #:database keyword, but the implementation (in db/private/generic/dsn.rkt) does not support that keyword.

(I don't know which of those is right. I just discovered it in the process of writing a TR wrapper for db.)
