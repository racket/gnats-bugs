>Description:
The `smtp-send-message' procedure in the `smtp' library of the `net' collection sends "EHLO" when it should send "HELO".  Apparently this is not an important part of the protocol because the SMTP server I use doesn't seem to mind; it sends a 250 followed by a 500, which confuses the procecure into thinking everything's okay, and the message ends up being sent just fine.

Still, it would probably be nice to send the right message, and perhaps improve the error-checking.

	    (newline)
	    (close-output-port out))))
(require (lib "smtp.ss" "net"))

 That's not a typo. "EHLO" instead of "HELO" turns on extended SMTP.
 
 In theory, `smtp-send-message' should fall back to "HELO" if "EHLO" is
 rejected. But that requires real work :), and I've never encountered an
 SMTP server that didn't support "EHLO".
 
 In this case, it doesn't sound like "EHLO" is rejected. I don't
 understand how the server can send 250 then 500. Isn't every command to
 the server supposed to generate exactly one reply? Also, I'm fairly
 certain that `smtp-send-message' wouldn't work with an extra 500 reply.

 Sorry!  I should have done more research.  http://cr.yp.to/smtp/ehlo.html

 My fault again-- I tested it with telnet (from an emacs shell buffer),
 and I was accidentally sending an extra newline.  I tried it with
 tcp-connect and it only sends the 250.
 
 Nevermind!  :)
