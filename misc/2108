>Description:
When I tested with local syntax provided by example as follows:

(local ((define (f x) (+ x 5))
        (define (g alon) 
          (cond 
            [(empty? alon) empty] 
            [else (cons (f (first alon)) (g (rest alon)))]))) 
  (g (list 1 2 3))) 


error => definition: invalid position for internal definition

Any possible to avoid that?.

 Hi - it looks like your question fell through the cracks. (At least,
 there's no record that it was ever answered.) Sorry about that!
 
 I'm guessing that you meant to use DrScheme "Intermediate" language,
 but that you were using either the "Beginning Student" or "Full"
 language instead. (Despite its name, the Full language doesn't have the
 `local' form built-in.)
 
 To change the language, use "Language" menu in DrScheme.
 
 Hope that helps,
 Matthew
