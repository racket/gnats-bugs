>Description:
If using draw.ss and proving a bad argument, the arg-count is off in the error message:

     (draw-solid-line (make-posn 0 0) (make-posn 80 80) "bogus" 'red)

reports

     draw.ss: expected <symbol> as first argument, given: "bogus"

(and: shouldn't the error come from "draw-solid-line" rather than "draw.ss")

>How-To-Repeat:
     (draw-solid-line (make-posn 0 0) (make-posn 80 80) "bogus" 'red)
