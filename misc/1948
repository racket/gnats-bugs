>Description:
The xml library reports errors of helper functions (without context) when


recieving bad input. For example, this program:





(require (lib "xml.ss" "xml"))


(xexpr->xml


 `(html


   (head (title "Links"))


   (body


    (h1 "Links")


    (ul


     (li


      "Miscellaneous"


      (ul


       ((a


         ((href "Texas Department of Public Safety"))


         "http://dps.texasonline.state.tx.us/"))))))))





produces the output:





  srep->attribute: expected (cons Symbol String) given (a ((href Texas Department of Public Safety)) http://dps.texasonline.state.tx.us/)





This is bad for four reasons.





1. (As I have reported in earlier bugs about the xml library) error


messages must use the ~e format to format values in the user's program. In


this case, I have already fixed this error message and two others in the


same file (plt/collects/xml/private/xexpr.ss), but there may be others in


other files.





2. the error message doesn't report the library call that was actually


used, it reports some internal helper function that users of the library


don't know about, which makes it hard to figure out who is reporting the


error.





3. the error message doesn't include the entire xexpr that is being


converted, for context. Like mz primitive's do, the entire value passed


over to the library should be reported by the error.





4. the error message should report that it expected that thing to be an


*attribute* (and perhaps of which tag) -- (cons Symbol String) is nice, but


it needs to say a little bit more.
