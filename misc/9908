>Description:
This is my first night with PLT Scheme, but I believe I've found a bug in the documentation. Reading through section 2.2, I was working through the following example:

Instead of duplicating the "huh?" case, this function is better written as

  (define (reply s)
    (if (if (string? s)
            (equal? "hello" (substring s 0 5)
            #f))
        "hi!"
        "huh?"))

PLT gives the following error when evaluating that code:

if: bad syntax (must have an "else" expression) in: (if (string? s) (equal? "hello" (substring s 0 5) #f))

I believe the correct syntax in the example would be as follows:

(define (reply s)
  (if (if (string? s)
          (equal? "hello" (substring s 0 5))
          #f)
      "hi!"
      "huh?"))

Please excuse me if I'm wrong. I'm new to scheme.

Sincerely,
Travis Whitton

for the next doc build (along with the example
before it). Thanks very much for the report!
