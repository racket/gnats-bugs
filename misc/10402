>Description:
The test engine now issues misleading messages, 
claiming that some test passed when in fact it 
didn't. Specifically, when a function raises an 
exception, we see two pieces of flawed behavior: 

1. The testing stops and the exception-raising 
expression is high-lighted in the WRONG color 
(grey, not pink). 

2. The test engine reports that the test has passed. 
When you have many tests, it reports that N tests
have passed ONE MORE THAN actually passed. For a 
THINKING programmer, this is horribly misleading. 
Even for NON-THINKING programmers this may add obscurity. 

(No problem for single-function programs this isn't 
much of a problem. It also isn't a problem if you 
run after EVERY completion of a test expression. 
Nobody does this in his sound mind, however.) 

;; ---- 

I'd like to request once again that the test 
engine runs to completion and catches all run-time 
exceptions. For test cases that fail, it should 
provide a link to the information that DrScheme 
would provide -- both the high-lighting of the 
exception-raising expressions AND the error message. 

Thanks. 
>How-To-Repeat:

 IIRC, Mike committed something to the test engine yesterday, so maybe
 that's what changed things?

 I'm sure I did it.  I'll see into it.

 I just fixed this.  I'm sure other nits will surface: The control flow
 within the test-engine code is hideously complicated.
