>Description:
According to the documentation for the make-evaluator function in scheme/sandbox, "when requires is provided, the indicated modules are implicitly included in the allow list."

This doesn't seem to happen if "requires" is a list of more than one path.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require scheme/sandbox)

;; This compiles and runs with no errors:
(make-evaluator 'scheme
                #:requires (list (string->path "sb-mod-test.scm")))

;; This produces an error:
(make-evaluator 'scheme
                #:requires (list (string->path "sb-mod-test.scm")
                                 (string->path "sb-mod-test2.scm")))

; file-or-directory-modify-seconds: `read' access denied for c:\home\src\holdem\scheme\sb-mod-test2.scm

;; This works.
(make-evaluator 'scheme
                #:requires (list (string->path "sb-mod-test.scm")
                                 (string->path "sb-mod-test2.scm"))
                #:allow-read (list (string->path "sb-mod-test2.scm")))

;; Note that the content of the two require'd files seems to be irrelevant.

 Thanks for the report -- this is fixed in svn.  The code in question
 was broken in several other ways, and it just happens that it worked
 with one item in the `#:requires' list.  (BTW, using it is not really
 a good idea, it is generally better to use `make-module-evaluator',
 which works like the "Module" language in DrScheme.)
