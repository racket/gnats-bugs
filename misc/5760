Human Language: danish
>Description:
Exercice 5.1.5 in HTDP states that if the user guesses the
correct colors, the check-color function should return 'perfect

However in the source collects\htdp\master.ss it checks for
these stop words:
(define STOPS (list 'PerfectGuess 'perfect_guess 'perfect!))

Thus the occurence of the trumpet and "New game?"-question
never appears.

I suggests to add 'perfect to the list.
(And at the same time 'perfekt 'Perfekt (which is perfect in danish :-) )
