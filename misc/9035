This is embarrassing -- I'm teaching a class in
Scheme and this isn't helping...

 In the "How To Design Programs" languages, cons has a different  
 meaning; as you've deduced, it can only be used to create lists.   
 This is because these language levels are designed to go along with  
 the textbook "How To Design Programs."
 
 In, e.g., the language "PLT > Textual (MzScheme, includes R5RS)":
 
  > (cons 'a 'b)
 (a . b)
 
 Hope this helps,
 
 John Clements

 The "Advanced Student" language is not Scheme! (hence the name....)
 
 I suspect you want to use one of the many Scheme variant programming
 languages which all do allow this (despite that claims to the contrary
 below). Here's a sampling:

 John,
 this is the most incredible service in the history
 of computing, I'm sure.  Thanks VERY much for clearing
 this up for me.  I definitely appreciate it!
 
 Cheers,
 Chris

 I do understand the distastes for manuals and canned demo tours
 that come with software. And we should perhaps name the teaching
 languages in an even more radical manner to avoid this
 misunderstanding that they have anything to do in Scheme. In my
 own classes, and in my talks (you may recall the part of my talk
 where I said "not Scheme!") I emphasize that the teaching languages
 are NOT Scheme and that in my HtDP courses you cannot learn Scheme.
 
 Still, I'd like to add a hint. Before I lecture, I always try out the
 demos that I intend to give. Even if I don't read anything that
 comes with the software, I run it and I check to make sure that
 things work as expected. Indeed, to this day, I prepare myself
 for lectures with DrScheme in this manner. And on occasion, I
 (re)discover things that I had forgotten and avoid embarrassing
 myself in front of class

 Matthias, you're absolutely right and I'm absolutely stupid.
 I did try the "teaching languages" and things seemed OK but
 it didn't occur to me to try cons.  No excuses, I've been
 doing this 30 years and I still get caught.  The moral is
 never take anything for granite until you've run it
 yourself.   Thanks for drawing a useful conclusion
 from my useless confusion!
