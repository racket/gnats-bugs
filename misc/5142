 What version of Windows are you running?

 You're not the only one to report this problem.
 
 We're looking into it.

 Are you running DrScheme from a file server, or from your own computer?
 
 Did you download it?  If so, what site did you download it from?

 Steven,
 
 	I installed XP on a machine yesterday, and got DrScheme
 v200alpha1 to run without incident.
 
 	You can try this version by downloading it from:
 
 	http://download.plt-scheme.org/
 
 	The "real" v200 should be released within the next few weeks.

 Here's another possibility:
 
 Try deleting your PLT directory (usually, 
 "C:\Program Files\PLT") by hand, and reinstall.
 You can do this in Windows Explorer by dragging
 the directory to the Recycle Bin.
 
 It could be that some old files are lying around
 that DrScheme doesn't understand.
