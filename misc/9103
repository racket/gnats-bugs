 Hello,
 
 
 This is not a bug: mzscheme supports infix-style notation if you use two 
 dots.  That is, the reader will treat:
 
     (1 . + . 3)
 
 as if the user actually typed (+ 1 3).
 
 
 See:
 
 http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/371/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-11.html#node_idx_2368
 
 for more details on infix expressions.  You can turn this feature of the 
 reader on or off by adjusting the 'read-accept-infix-dot' parameter:
