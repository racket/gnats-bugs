>Description:
Below is the only small example I could get to reproduce, but
I was also seeing this error message:

  vector-ref: bad index 0 for empty vector

coming from pretty-print (I know because I used printfs
to determine that the call to pretty-print was signalling
that error, but I might have lost some sharing or
something when I printed out the values to try to
reproduce this; also the below is a vector, not a
unit/sig (confusing!))

vector-ref: expects type <non-negative exact integer> as 2nd argument, given: -1; other arguments were: #0()
