Presumably this wasn't updated when the switch to separate
path objects was made.

 What exactly do you think is broken?

 My reading comprehension skills, obviously.
 
 I figured it out, but the error message could be a lot more helpful.
 I'm used to the term "absolute path," I don't think I've ever heard
 "complete path" used before in a technical sense.  Also a more
 specific message would have been more clear:
 
   Error: "." is not a complete path
 
 Sorry for the trouble, please close the bug.
