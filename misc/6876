>Description:
Setup-plt fails to pre-compile the pl-plot stuff when
run in a source tree that was upgraded (in-place) from
206.1 to 207.1.  Error message follows:
setup-plt: Pre-Installing Plot library
/home/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/compiled/native/i386-linux/fit-low-level.so
make: checking /home/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/compiled/native/i386-linux/fit-low-level.so

 [?,?]: Error: Error during prefix loading: collects/compiler/compiled/cffi.zo: read (compiled): code compiled for version 206.1, not 207.1
make: Failed to make /home/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/plot/src/fit/fit-low-level.c; Errors encountered.  Compilation aborted.

Setup-plt continues to build other C extensions and
most of the .zos required.

My guess is that the pl-plot build process uses
some of the .zos, and therefore setup-plt needs to
delete the obsolete .zos before building pl-plot.
>How-To-Repeat:
cvs checkout plt -d v206p1
mkdir build; cd build
../plt/src/configure --disable-xft
make
make install
../plt/install  (or whatever you have to do to get
  setup-plt to run on a fresh build)
cd ..
/bin/rm -rf build
cd plt
cvs update -dPr exp
cd ..
mkdir build; cd build
../plt/src/configure --disable-xft
make
make install
../plt/bin/setup-plt

Reason>>> plot setup bug.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by raymond at Mon, 26 Jul 2004 15:42:57 -0400
