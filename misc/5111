>Description:
I hit the analyze button, and then chose to collapse the sexpression.
I got the following internal error message:
procedure get-text method in sexp-snip%: expects 3 arguments, given 2: 0 1
My DrScheme seemed to stop redrawing itself (i.e. I had several large
blocks of white within the definitions window), and I had to restart
DrScheme. (I only had the one window open at the time, and I didn't 
try to open another).
>How-To-Repeat:
I could not repeat the error
