>Description:
When I select create executable from DrScheme and choose "distribution" and "Mred" DrScheme creates a zipfile containing an executable and DLLs but an empty collections directory.  When I unzip the distribution and run the exe, it complains about lacking a collection called srfi.  When I copy the srfi directory from the main PLT\collects directory the executable runs properly.  Error follows:

collection-path: collection not found: "srfi" in any of: (#<path:C:\Documents and Settings\aarrr\Application Data\PLT Scheme\350\collects> #<path:C:\Documents and Settings\aarrr\Desktop\hashare-client\lib\plt\hashare-client\collects>)
>How-To-Repeat:
The top of my program looks like this

(module my-client mzscheme
  (require (lib "class.ss"))
  (require (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
  (require "./mylib.ss")
  (require (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))
  (require (lib "string.ss" "srfi" "13"))
  (require (lib "list.ss" "srfi" "1"))

 I tried this code instead:
 
   (module x mzscheme
     (require (lib "class.ss"))
     (require (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
     ;(require "./mylib.ss")
     (require (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))
     (require (lib "string.ss" "srfi" "13"))
     (require (lib "list.ss" "srfi" "1"))
     (require (lib "port.ss"))
     (s:for-each (lambda (x) (printf ">>> ~s\n" x)) '(1 2 3)))
 
 and things worked fine.  Are you sure that you're not using some
 dynamic-require or an equivalent?  Can you minimize a complete
 example?

 That much is expected. The initial module and all transitively
 `require'd modules are inlined into the executable.

 Something is using `collection-path', which is a dynamic operation that
 is not visible to the executable maker.
 
 Ideally, avoid operations like `collection-path' and `dynamic-require'.
 I see that the "srfi" collection includes uses of `collection-path', so
 this may be something for SRFI maintainers to fix.
 
 Sometimes a source file or auxiliary file is needed at run-time,
 though. In that case, the Scheme API (or the mzc interface) lets you
 supply collections to copy into the the "collects" directory that is
 empty by default; see `create-embedding-executable',
 `assemble-distribution', and `bundle-directory'.
