>Description:
This program:

#lang scheme

(define f (flat-named-contract "foo" (or/c number? boolean?)))

(define/contract x (listof f) (list 1 2 #f))

gives this error:

../scheme/private/contract-guts.ss:302:6: andmap: expects type <procedure> as 1st argument, given: #<flat-or/c>; other arguments were: (1 2 #f)

Without the `flat-named-contract', it works properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
added a check to flat-named-contract
>Release-Note:
This was a (missing) contract violation. It probably would have been a type error.

Reason>>> The bug is not as described in the PR. What should have
happened is that flat-named-contract should have signaled
an error, because it only accepts procedures as its second
argument.

That has been fixed and now the output is:

flat-named-contract: expected a procedure of arity 1 as
second argument, got #<flat-or/c>

 Is there a way to give a name to an arbitrary contract?

 On ecould write a rename-contract function that just copies the
 low-level structs, replacing a field. (I forget if I've written this
 before, but I don't think so.)
 
 For first-order contract, you can extreact the predicate before
 calling flat-named-contract.
