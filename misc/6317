>Description:
As its contract states, the match-pattern function
returns a list of bindings structs if the pattern
matches.  However, the reduction-semantics module
does not export selectors and predicates for either
the bindings or the rib structs, severely limiting
the usefulness of the results.  Could you export
at least the selectors and predicates for these
structs?  I'm less concerned about constructors,
mutators, and structure tags.

(Also, the docs for match-pattern seem to indicate
that on success the function returns an alist---i.e.,
something that I could pass to assoc.)

 Sure, go ahead -- please put in contracts, too.
