 Unfortunately, I think that that's just the way it works for now. I'm
 not completely clear on the status of begin-for-syntax and whether or
 not it can be nullified somehow before the second expansion, but
 debugging and profiling are implemented by taking a fully expanded
 program, rewriting it, and then expanding it again (this time with
 annotations that make it record what it is doing).
 
 BTW, there is another profiler that is now integrated with DrRacket
 yet that you might want to try. It doesn't require re-expansion. You
 can find it in the profile library (search for 'profile' in the docs).

State changed from "open" to "closed" by ryanc at Mon, 03 Jan 2011 16:02:31 -0500
Reason>>> fundamental limitation of errortrace and post-expansion
instrumentation


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "ryanc" by eli at Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:53:57 -0500
Reason>>> ryanc closed
