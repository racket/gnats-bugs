It's okay in 101, but I decided to test on 102 because we're mucking around
with launching.

 The difference is that you never run plt/install with 102 (since it's
 CVSed).
 
 In other words, real distributions don't require the PLTHOME
 environment variable, but a CVS-based "distribution" does.
 
 You could run install in your CVSed plt directory, but please don't;
 the scripts in plt/bin might get committed accidentally.

 Wait I set the PLTHOME variable, but it still doesn't work.

 It sounded so strange that I tried logging in as you. But then I
 noticed the command line:
 
    string=? ; exec mzscheme -x -g -l core.ss -r $0 "$@"  
                             ^^
 "-x" means "don't try to find the collections".

 Thanks.

 There is no "-x" anymore, so your bug report is using something that 
 is specific to your site. This makes things impossible to debug. So, 
 if you want any help from me, send something that I can try here 
 without having to guess what you were doing.
 
 Of course, it is possible someone else will figure this out based on 
 the sketchy info you sent, if they have made recent modifications.

 Thanks. Matthew says the -x flag now means "don't load collects" :-)
