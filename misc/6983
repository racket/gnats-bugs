 I always viewed doc.txt files as extensive+searchable readme files,
 unlike stuff in collects/docs which I took as the bunch of manuals you
 get with the software.  Adding the doc.txt files to the web page is
 probably not feasible without a major restructuring of the whole
 thing, so I guess that the only solution to this semi-problem is a
 better link name, but I can't think of anything better that fits
 within three words.

 Putting the doc.txt files onto the web wouldn't be a bad idea, imo
 (planet does/will do this, I think?).
 
 But if it's not feasible, perhaps just putting a warning about it on
 the documentation web page is enough?

 The daily build files include the doc.txt files:
 
     <http://download.plt-scheme.org/scheme/plt/collects/algol60/doc.txt> .
 
 It's just hard to find, even when you know where to look.
 
 
 Hm - a search box on <http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/> would
 also be nice.

 The download/docs hierarchy is not too flexible...  Currently there
 is:
 
   <version>/bundles/<doc>.plt
   <version>/html/<doc>/...
   <version>/pdf/<doc>.pdf
 
 symbolic links to the last released version
 
   <doc> -> <last-version>/html/<doc>/
 
 one such link is to an old version
 
   mrspidey -> 103p1/html/mrspidey/
 
 icons are for some reason taken from 205 (they're not in newer
 builds):
 
   icons -> 205/html/icons/
 
 and the nightly builds are
 
   pre-release -> ../scheme/docs
 
 Adding doc.txt files into this will make it even more messy.  Adding a
 sentence that there are doc.txt files in packages seems like the best
 solution for now.  One of the things I want to get to at some point is
 go over the iplt/web tree and make it actually build *everything* in
 the web hierarchies, creating a self-containing result that will
 replace the existing trees, rather than copying stuff on top of what's
 there.  This would be a good time to add the doc.txt files.  Older
 versions would be included in iplt/web as .tgz files.
 
 BTW, I prefer if these are kept to the minimum of only the .plt files
 that are needed for older versions -- there is a lot of traffic on the
 older htmls, because they tend to be better indexed (they're much
 older), so the effectiveness of googling is also limited by them, and
 there are probably lots of cases of people mislead or confused by
 them.  I don't think that it's a big deal if older drscheme versions
 will not be able to browse these things on-line if it is still
 possible to install them locally.  (There are ways of dealing with
 search engines, but it will be difficult to do this right.)
 
 (It's probably best if replies to this will go to plt-internal.)

 There is a search box on the pre-release pages, but it's not too great
 because of the above.
 
 I suppose that it would be possible to run a help-desk server, but the
 current hierarchy will make it pretty difficult to manage.

 You can't -- it must be at the server's top level, so the file will
 have to be rebuilt for every version, forbidding indexing on the
 previous one, which is a fragile solution.  Google has extensions to
 the format that allows you to put wildcards, but that's not the
 standard (IIRC).  A reasonable solution would be to have the old
 versions in some directory that can be completely excluded, but I
 think that it's a bad idea to keep the content...
 
 (Another solution which is even worse is a script that will crawl over
 the tree and change each file so it forbids indexing in its meta
 tags.)

 I'm just thinking of the guy who was working with 207 last week,
 visiting the manuals online and stuff and then, one day, boom -- the

 I had typed it wrong in the first email. I constantly type "lists" when
 it should be "list". I don't know why those guys picked that name!
 
 It's fixed above now (hopefully...) and bugs is in there too.

 Yeah, but I think that the potential damage (outdated or wrong
 information) is bigger than the benefit (a little less convenient).
 Since changing installed trees all over the world is impossible, then
 maybe it's best if clicking on the on-line doc link in help desk and
 getting nowhere will tell you that you're using an old version so you
 have to install the manual?  (And keep the current structure for
 recent releases, removing them gradually.)

 Replacing the docs with an informative page seems just as painful as
 making them invisible to searchers, but it would be fine with me.

 Probably more painful, but what bothers me more is the fact that they
 are accessible.  (There might be a way to hack the apache
 configuration so it doesn't serve some pages based on the user-agent,
 but help-desk doesn't send any user agent.)

 Apache's mod_rewrite will do this for you. See the example use of the 
 RewriteCond directive here:
 
 http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond
 
 And help-desk probably ought to be sending a user-agent anyway ...

 That's probably too much work.

 As Jacob noted, there is a simple way to do that but the problem is,
 again, existing help desks that don't send this information...

 Maybe you could use the fact that Help Desk _doesn't_ send a UA field 
 and rewrite based on  ^$ being the user-agent. AFAIK, almost everything 
 sends a user-agent field so the absence of one can be taken as strong 
 evidence that you're interacting with Help Desk.

 I'll try to add a user agent for 299.
