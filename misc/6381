>Description:
Several of the links in the help-desk's copy of R5RS
appear to be broken.  See below for details:
>How-To-Repeat:
In the help desk, open the R5RS from the manuals page;
you should see the title page.  Click on the `contents'
link; you'll get a blank page.  Hit rewind, then select
the `next page' link twice -- the contents are there,
just not where the first link expects them to be.

Similarly, from the contents page, click on the link
for chapter 1.  Blank page; hit rewind then next
twice to get to the actual page.

 I think this is fixed already. Does cvs-update make it work?

 If you mean hitting the refresh link in the help-desk window, no.  I
 tried that right before I submitted the PR.
 
 If that's not what you mean, could you explain further?  As far as I can
 tell, the manuals aren't in CVS.  (Or, more precisely, a `cvs update
 -dPr exp' doesn't put the manuals in a place where the help-desk can
 find them.)
 
 There are other difficulties with the manuals, though; I tried the
 `refresh all manuals' link, and things got seriously confused.  It
 appears that DrScheme is now looking in ~/.plt-scheme/204.9/collects/doc
 for the manuals, but some of the manuals (most notably R5RS and
 tex2page) still install themselves into the old location, where
 help-desk can't see them.  Copying the files over seems to work,
 although it doesn't fix the original problem.
 
 What's the current story on documentation?  Should I move everything
 into ~/.plt-scheme and delete plt/collects/doc?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Richard

 No, I mean cvs-update to get the latest code.

 That's a real problem - thanks for pointing it out.

 Yes, that sounds right. I think that it should be okay to change help
 desk to look for all docs subcollections. What do you think?

 I looked into this a little bit further, and it appears that the
 changes to make this work (help desk finding the docs in multiple docs
 collections) are a little bit scary this late in the game. The
 transcript below shows all the places that would (probably) have to
 change. Almost certainly no other places would have to change, and
 probably most of those would.
 
 What do you suggest? Try to make those changes? Or, perhaps change the
 -doc.plt so that they install them selves into the plt tree?

 Sounds right.

 Yes --- let's do that.
 
 There's a flag for mzc (--all-users) or an argument to `pack' that does
 this do this.

 Do you want to do that or shall I? I'm not entirely sure of the script
 to change (I've read it I think, but I think you wrote it?)

 Actually, I cc'ed Eli because I thought he was in the best position.
 
 But I've added arguments to the `pack' call in iplt/doc/bundle-html.ss,
 which may be all that's necessary.

 It appears that this wasn't all that was needed. I guess that the
 Makefile doesn't have dependencies on the bundle-html.ss script, so the
 .plt files weren't rebuilt?
 
 Anyways, I've deleted /proj/scheme/iplt/doc/html/bundles/*.plt. I
 cannot run the build-plt-docs script myself, but hopefully we'll see
 something fixed appears there tomorrow.

 Still not getting properly installed manuals. I'll wait until I hear
 from one of you before trying again. Here's the current status:
 
 in wrong place:

 With latest cvs exp:
 
 - now all doc updates seem to get installed in the "wrong place"
  ~/Library/PLT Scheme/205/collects/doc vs /plt/collects/doc/?
 
 - But now some links seem to work, specifically:
