I got the following message from "Dwight VandenBerghe"

  Hi --

  Some files are missing or invalid, for rev 49.  I think MrSpidey.ps.zip
  is not there, and the all.zip doesn't contain much (it's only about 4K).
  I finally got all I needed, but I had to ftp directly from the ftp site.
  It all looks great, so far - thanks for all your work!

  Dwight

Please CC relevant replies to him.  Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:  
Indeed the mrspidey.ps.zip, m3.*, all.zip, all.tar.gz files were 
either missing or empty (contained only icons).  I've remade the 
docs and installed the missing ones.  

Still don't know why they were missing in the first place, 
but it was a complicated release.
