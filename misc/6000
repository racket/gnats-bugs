>Description:
Hello, I'm a university student, and i've a problem:

If i open the canvas, so in advanced student with draw.ss teachpack,
so in the module with the require of the library, DrScheme goes in loop
until i close the canvas. The program display alternativly running/not running in a very fast way, as if it is in a strange loop.

My operative system is win Xp with service pack 1 and all the other updates. What should i do?

Please answer me as fast as possible, becouse i must make a work for my university's exam.

    Thank you     cataldi.enrico@inwind.it
