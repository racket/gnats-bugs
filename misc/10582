When slideshow is used to print a talk to PS or PDF, it renders some embedded bitmaps which are transparent PNGs very badly.  For an example, see: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~samth/tmp/sun-slides.pdf (which was printed to PS on Linux, then converted to PDF).  If you look at slide 6, the Firefox logo renders almost correctly (extra black border), but the rhino looks terrible.  The behavior is worse on OSX, printing directly to PDF.

 I believe this is a "will be fixed by mred v2" issue.

 While I expect that to be the case, right now I have a bunch of talks
 in Slideshow, I'd like to put versions of them online, and they look
 terrible.  So I hope this is something that can be fixed in MrEd 1 in
 the meantime.
 
 I'd be happy to help fixing it, but I'd need a pointer as to where to look.

 Note that printer-dc% and post-script-dc% are two different
 implementations, so it might be worth your time to look at both to
 decide which one to fix before fixing either.

 I guess you'll see the same issues if you try to draw those bitmaps
 directly to a printer-dc% or a post-script-dc%. So probably making
 that little program is the first step and then going and looking at
 the C++ code that gets called to implement the relevant methods
 (draw-bitmap, presumably).

 The main thing to understand is that PS/PDF doesn't support an alpha
 channel. An alpha channel for bitmap drawing is approximated in
 `post-script-dc%' output by building a clipping region that corresponds
 to all non-0 alpha values.
 
 (This is not something that gets fixed automatically by MrEd 2 or
 Cairo. It looks like the same sort of clipping-region approximation
 will have to be implemented on top of Cairo, since Cairo handles the
 problem by not drawing anything.)
 
 Various images, especially the Rhino image, look like they may have a
 lot of small, non-0 alpha values. The `post-script-dc%' approximation
 effectively increases those values to 255 and exposes a lot of colors
 that you would not otherwise see. The solution may be to using a bitmap
 for printing where you've manually collapsed the alpha space to a mask,
 so you can manually pick a good approximation.
 
 Given that information, if you think there's a bug, the place to try to
 fix it is "PSDC.cxx".

 So, it seems like ImageMagick is able to do a good job with this.  You
 can see the results of

 at http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~samth/tmp/rhino-out.ps and
 http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~samth/tmp/rhino-out.ps and they look the way I
 expect.
 
 This gives me hope that we can do this as well, so I'll take a look at the code.

 Sam: if it were me, I'd compute the precise image you need via
 slideshow and render that (ie, draw the slide into a bitmap-dc%, draw
 the rhino on top, clip the thing, create a new bitmap and then draw
 that. all at the slideshow level).
 
 But doing the more general thing would be more useful in the long run. :)

 I'm pretty sure that it's working at the bitmap level --- drawing
 pixels, and then converting the final (opaque) pixels to postscript.
 
 You can get the same effect in MrEd by drawing to a bitmap and then
 drawing the bitmap to a PostScript output. If you're happy having all
 the text and lines on your slide turn into pixels, you could easily
 change Slideshow to do that.

 Would it be possible for Slideshow to handle the 'background'
 specially?  I'm not sure exactly what I mean here, but obviously the
 alpha channel isn't a problem unless there's something behind the
 bitmap.
 
 Also, it turns out that thresholding the alpha channel at 1 (out of
 255) for the rhino image in the Gimp makes everything look nice.
 Which suggests that perhaps MrEd could choose a different threshold
 (at the 255 threshold, it looked like the printed version).
