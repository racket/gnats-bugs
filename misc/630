 Sue Ellen: If you're looking for the graphics libraries you used in Mrs
 North's class, go to the _Plt_ folder, check inside of _lib_ then _teach_.
 In there you will find _draw-lib.ss_ and all the other friends. 
 
 If not, let me know what you downloaded (environment): that's the number
 behind DrScheme when you click on EXECUTE. 
 
 Finally, DrS has a lot more graphics than we can show in one semester.
 Something you might find interesting is the LOGO graphics that comes with
 DrScheme. Just click on HELP and look for "turtle" and "logo". It also 
 contains some sample files based on fractals.
