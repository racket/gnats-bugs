 The subversion repository is no longer updated -- what you see there
 is all outdated.

 So what do I get when I do an svn checkout according to the instructions 
 at svn.plt-scheme.org?  Except for the README it all looks like Racket.
 
 I assume all this stuff is going to be announced when the release is 
 made (like how non-contributors get the latest sources)?

 You get the random point where we left svn.  Perhaps I should roll
 back the racket changes there to make it clear.  The
 svn.plt-scheme.org page is also outdated, and it will eventually say
 something about this, and point to the git pages (which will also have
 some instructions, unlike the current skeleton).
 
 If you really want a subversion interface, you can use the github svn
 bridge:
 
   svn checkout http://svn.github.com/plt/racket
 
 pushes to the git repository are immediately mirrored onto github, so
 using that svn emulation thing will be current.

 Yes.
