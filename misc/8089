>Description:
Exceptions are not recognized by Swindle as <exn> instances.  Also, <non-break-exn> should probably be renamed to <exn:fail>.
>How-To-Repeat:
=> (define exn (make-exn "foo" (current-continuation-marks)))
=> (class-of exn)
#<primitive-class:exn>
=> (instance-of? exn <exn>)
#f
=> <exn>
#<primitive-class:exn>
=> (eq? (class-of exn) <exn>)
#f

 I think this is a typo:
 
   (set-exn-class <exn:fail> make-exn:fail)
   (set-exn-class <exn:fail> make-exn:break (let/ec e e)))
 
 Should the second one be <exn:break>?

 Yes, good catch.  Thanks.
