 I believe big-draw-lib.ss is actually at fault, here. 
 
 While draw-solid-ellipse accepts an optional color argument,
 clear-solid-ellipse does not, and I don't think it makes sense for the
 clear- operations to accept colors.

    I believe big-draw-lib.ss is actually at fault, here. 
 
    While draw-solid-ellipse accepts an optional color argument,
    clear-solid-ellipse does not, and I don't think it makes sense for the
    clear- operations to accept colors.
 
 I am pretty certain that this worked before. 
 
 Also, I was about to fix big-draw when I checked draw-solid-line 
 and clear-solid-line. They work -- with extra arguments: 
 
  (draw-solid-line (make-posn 10 10) (make-posn 90 90)  BLUE)
  (clear-solid-line (make-posn 10 10) (make-posn 90 90) BLUE)
 
 This draws and earses a BLUE line. 
 
 How should we make this consistent.

 Right. Robby fixed it.

 It seems that line-drawing didn't get as much fixing as shape-drawing.
 (That explains the line-specific color problems.) I'll change the
 clear- functions for lines so they don't accept an extra argument.

 Okay, i will change big-draw-lib so that clear's don't take color
 arguments.

 What do you mean by "fix"?
