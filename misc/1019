The shading on the help-desk buttons is bizarre, and counter to the 'sun in the upper left' policy of both the mac and windows. I think this is inherited from tex->html, but I'd be glad to fix it, if I get the go-ahead.

 Fine with me. Put the new icons in ~scheme/plt/collects/doc/icons and
 ~scheme/Packages/TrashyTeXTools/latex2html/icons.
