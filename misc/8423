 I'm missing something, I think.  The mzscheme documentation (see
 "slibinit" in indexed content in the helpdesk - search for slib)
 indicates that one loads the slib (not PLT's version, but slib's
 version) by evaluating the form "(require (lib "load.ss" "slibinit"))".
 
 
 This doesn't work.  It can be fixed by changing "*features*" to
 "slib:features" in the file 
 "Program Files/PLT/collects/slibinit/init.ss"
 
 "slib:features" is the list referred to in slib's require.scm by many
 functions including provide, provided?, etc.  It does not look for
 "*features*".
 
 From your comments, though, I'm thinking this is the wrong thing to do
 (in which case, perhaps the documentation should be updated), but I'm
 not sure then how to load slib.
 
 Can you point me to a place where I can find out the right way to do
 this?
 
 Thanks,

 The problem is that SLIB is trying to be a portable library for all
 Scheme implementations.  It is therefore distributed with a bunch of
 files for each Scheme implementation that it supports.  At some point
 in the past, the initialization file was added to the PLT source tree,
 but it has not been kept in sync with the SLIB sources.  To avoid
 redundant efforts, and people relying on the old version that was part
 of the PLT distribution, we just removed it completely.  It would
 probably be much better for you to ignore the `slibinit' collection in
 PLT completely and just read through the SLIB docs to see how to use
 it from PLT.
