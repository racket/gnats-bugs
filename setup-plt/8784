>Description:
The attached patch to setup-extension.ss in the make collection fixes the following problems:

* When trying to make the 3m variant, the pre-install procedure would fail with an error of 

make: Failed to make /Users/farr/Documents/code/nbody/compiled/native/ppc-macosx/3m/libnbody.c; regexp-match: expects type <string, byte string, or input port> as 2nd argument, given: #<path:/Users/farr/Documents/code/nbody/nbody-c/libnbody.c>; other arguments were: #rx"([.]cc$)|([.]cxx$)"

the problem was that xform-src.c was a path instead of a string when passed to the xform procedure.  In the patch the second argument of xform is (path->string xform-src.c).

* DarwinPorts directories were not searched on Mac OS X (these reside in "/opt/local".

* The (lib "process.ss") library was not used at all in the module, so I removed it.

Patch Follows:
