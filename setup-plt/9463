>Description:
After running 'setup-plt -c', I expected all the compiled directories in  the collections to be empty, but the following were not:

[america:~/plt]$ for i in `find collects -type d -name compiled`; do if [[ ! (-z `ls -1 $i`) ]]; then echo $i; fi; done

Almost all of these are related to errortrace, outside of plot ("native") and scribble/doc and scribble/doc/lang ("reader_ss.{dep,zo}").

These leftover bits were causing me major issues yesterday, because to me it seemed like I had cleared everything, but I'd still have "compiled for .0.25" errors when trying to run things.  Finally just manually removed all the compiled directories myself, and when that worked I decided to check and see what wasn't getting removed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run setup-plt
Run setup-plt -c
Run "for i in `find collects -type d -name compiled`; do if [[ ! (-z `ls -1 $i`) ]]; then echo "$i:"; ls -1 $i; echo; fi; done" from the plt directory (or something similar if not running bash) to get a list of what's left over.
