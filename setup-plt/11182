If this is something that students will run into, then things are

 The .plt file needs to actually say "run setup". Not all .plt files
 trigger setup.

 Aha -- `++setup' indeed makes it work.
 
 But there is still a problem somewhere:
 
 * I used to have this as the command to create the .plt file:
 
     mzc --collection-plt blah.plt --replace --at-plt blah
 
   which worked fine for a number of semesters, and now when I switched
   to
 
     raco pack --replace --at-plt --collect blah.plt blah
 
   it stopped working.  (But I didn't try mzc now.)
 
 * If I use
 
     raco setup -D -A blah.plt
 
   then the collection is made as expected (*without* `++setup' in the
   packaging) -- it's only
 
     setup-plt -D blah.plt
 
   that isn't doing it.  So there's at least some different behavior
   with the same .plt file that shouldn't be there.  (Unless I'm so
   tired that I messed something up in trying it out...)
