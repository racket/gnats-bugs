>Description:
I was wondering if anyone has experienced problems compiling racket
from the git repository under a Debian Linux (Testing) distribution?
It's being built on an (oldish) dual CPU AMD Athlon system.

I followed the steps outlined in the src/README file and the build gets most of the way through the configure/make/make install
sequence, until it reaches the documentation building step. It gets as
far as processing "scribblings/scheme/scheme.scrbl" at which point
racket3m blocks (indefinitely) at a select() call.

When I attach to the racket3m with gdb the stacktrace shows the process blocked on a select():

I can send you the full stack trace as well as any configuration files and build log you'd like to see.
