>Description:
If a normal user runs "setup-plt" to attempt compile a collection,
and that results in a compilation error message, "setup-plt" halts
because it cannot write to temporary file
"/usr/lib/plt/collects/setup/errors".  The following error message
is displayed:

    call-with-output-file: cannot open output file:
    "/usr/lib/plt/collects/setup/errors" (Permission denied; errno=13)

The problem is usually only noticed when the user does not have write
permission to the PLT install tree, as is the case with Debian's
packaging of MzScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.  Login as a user that does not have write permissions to the PLTCOLLECTS directory.
2.  Attempt to use setup-plt to compile a collection (perhaps one in your local PLTHOME path)
3.  If an error occurs, you will encounter this bug.

Fix should be for a true "tempfile" to be used for this kind of reporting.
