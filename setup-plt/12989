>Description:
Sometimes git decides to not put the correct time stamps on files when it changes them, and then raco make will not update the compiled versions of modified files.

I want an option that will force raco make to check checksums and not rely on timestamps as an approximation. This would be a slow operation because every file would need to be hashed, but it would allow quicker clean builds than the alternative of removing the compiled directories and then rebuilding everything.
