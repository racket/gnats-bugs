>Description:
I've semi-recently complained about the `-v' flag throwing an error when
used with parallel cores.  This was "fixed" by ignoring the flag in that
mode.  It would be nice if it was properly fixed.  (I just spent most of
today trying to figure timings out, a working `-v' would have saved me a
good portion of that time.
