>Description:
When building Racket from git source [around midnight, night of July 2 2011] on a Mac, the process gets stuck in an infinite loop when building documentation.  The last thing it prints is:
  raco setup: running: xml/xml.scrbl
After which it hangs there for at least half an hour, probably forever.  Here is more detailed error output:
  [...]

This is true for both 32- and 64-bit Mac builds, so that probably has nothing to do with the problem.

 Is it possible your machine is thrashing?

 I assume you mean "reading and writing to disk, using swap space in lieu of
 real memory".  Not possible.  This machine has 4 GB of memory; a few hundred
 MB were free, and according to Activity Monitor (and my ears), it was doing
 approximately zero disk I/O.  I'm pretty sure it was just stuck in some kind
 of loop.  (Incidentally, Activity Monitor seemed to indicate it was doing a
 bunch of system calls.  Do threads or places synchronize using system
 calls?)
 
 The only funky thing I might be doing with this computer is running the
 64-bit Mac OS X kernel.  However, I had been successfully building Racket
 from git source on this machine with that kernel for months; I only stopped
 when the Racket site started providing Mac x86_64 nightly builds.  Just to
 be sure, I'll also try it on another Mac, running the normal 32-bit kernel.
 
 ...and the other Mac succeeds in building it.  And this 64-bit kernel
 machine fails to build tonight's source, with the same symptoms as before.
  All right, add "run the 64-bit kernel" to the steps to reproduce, then.
  (It's also possible that there's something wrong with this machine in
 particular, but I doubt that.)

 And after a software update and a reboot, I succeed in building both the
 newest Racket and the versions from a few days ago I that had been
 attempting to build before (the full build takes slightly under 30 minutes).
  Strange.  I don't understand this.  Oh well... whatever the cause, it must
 have little to do with Racket.
