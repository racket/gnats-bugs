>Description:
Since my builds became painfully slow (see PR 12518), I finally took
some time to do some measuring.  My own update script uses `-j 2' so I
can use it while working on other things -- and it seems that this is a
particularly bad number, at least on winooski.  The numbers that I get
for a plain build are:

    -j 1: 1018s
    -j 2: 1879s
    -j 3: 883s
    -j 4: 794s

So a `-j 2' gets the build to be twice *longer*.  These times are not
overall sum times per core -- it's the actual time from the start of the
compilation to the end.  (Since the two cores were busy for some part of
that, the overall cpu time spent is probably more like 2.5 times
slower.)

I've heard multiple guesses so far about various kinds of overheads, but
a 2x slowdown of the absolute time it takes to do a full build sounds
like it's not just some overhead.
