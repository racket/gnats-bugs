 Is the package installed? Do you know anything about where the
 dependency came from?

 The package was installed, and then I think I replaced it with a new
 mongodb package.

 It occurs to me just now that "git://github.com/samth/mongodb" isn't a
 package name.
 
 I think that `raco setup` is incorrectly using a package source (which
 is allowed in a dependency declaration) as a package name. I'll fix
 that.
