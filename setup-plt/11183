>Description:
I'm not sure if this was raised -- besides spitting out many more
error messages in a parallel build (which I think is known):
- it looses the nice list of errors in the end (which might be a
  good idea if there's no way around having those repeated errors earlier
  FIXED
- it says "made: <user>/blah" *before* the errors in compiling the blah collection
  FIXED
- it doesn't say "making: blah", unlike the sequential build
  INTENDED BEHAVIOR Its easier to detect when a collection is finished when using parallel build hence "made:"
- it does say "making: racket", even though it's not doing anything there.
  I don't think this is new behavior.

It looks like:
- there might be a typo in some "made:" string where "making:" is
  supposed to be.
- it prints "making: racket" since that's required for the rest of
  the process -- but dropping it when it's not doing anything seems
  like a desired behavior.
- as for the repeated error messages: even a simple check of each
  error message to see if it was printed is probably going to improve
  things.

 Actually this is still bad -- if I run a setup and don't look at the
 scrolling screen, I can miss these messages and think that everything
 went fine.

 FWIW, I think it builds the racket collection in sequential mode
 before going on to parallel mode for building everything else.
