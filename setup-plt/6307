>Description:
"setup-unit.ss" installs an exit-handler that tries to write to a file named
"error" in the "setup" collection directory.

While this is probably useful for some purposes, would it be better if the
filename came from a command-line option, with the default being to not write
to a file?

    (exit-handler
       (let ([oh (exit-handler)])
	 (lambda (num)
	   (let ([error-log (build-path (collection-path "setup") "errors")])

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 02 Jun 2004 12:37:58 -0400
Reason>>> I don't know why the "errors" file is written. Since the
PR was assigned to me, I just commented out the
exit handler.
