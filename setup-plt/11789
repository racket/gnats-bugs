>Description:
When trying to build Racket v5.1 from source, I have no difficulty with configure or make, but make install fails rather quickly with an invalid cp command.
>How-To-Repeat:
First, I copied Racket v5.1 to my home directory and then went through th steps in the README

cd src
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install

(I actually first tried building with the 64-bit flag, but it doesn't make any difference). The code compiles without any problems (save for a few warnings), but make install fails quicky with an invalid cp command.

 This appears to be a problem with unescaped spaces appearing in the paths.

 That was my thought, too, but since the distribution uses a filename with an embedded space, I expected that it would be handled correctly. My poor little Macbook Air is getting a real workout building from source!  In fact, it just finished, and it seems to work fine.

 (I renamed the directory changing spaces to underscores and that did the trick.)
