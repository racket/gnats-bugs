>Description:
When I get errors running "Setup PLT.exe" on Windows,
the diagnostic and error messages look like

  setup-plt: Done setting up
  setup-plt: 
  setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for SSL Driver (/proj/scheme/plt/collects/openssl)

Instead of the name `setup-plt', I think they should 
say `Setup PLT.exe', or maybe just `Setup PLT'.  I recall
there's a library procedure to translate to the 
Windows-specific name.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run Setup PLT.exe on Windows.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:47:41 -0500
Reason>>> Closing

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:47:41 -0500
Reason>>> I thought about hacking somthing, then realized that it's 
not worth spending time on it -- unix users expect "foo:" 
messages from a "foo" application, but Windows users don't 
have a command line so they're taken as just some messages 
in some format.  (And this is the name of the collection 
in all cases.)
