>Description:
I just moved a file in SVN. Changed a few references to the new name, but missed one. When I ran `Check Syntax' and setup-plt, there was no error, and I commited.

Then I realized that the .zo for the old name was still in the compiled/ directory, so setup-plt/etc were looking at that. Evne though the source was no longer there, the compilation was successful because both names were around.

I shouldn't have to remember these quirks.
