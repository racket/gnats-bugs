setup-plt doesn't check the scribbling's timestamp when compiling, so every time one compiles, the scribblings are being rendered (unlike the .zos and C/C++ files).

re-compile the source tree.

 A few documents are always re-rendered, such as "start" (the main table
 of contents) and "user start", but the rest should only be re-rendered
 if needed.
 
 The test is to compare the timestamp on the ".zo" version of the
 document's main file with the timestamp on the "index.html" file. And
 then if a document is re-built, anything that references that document
 also is re-built.
 
 Are you seeing more rebuilt than just "start" and "user start"? Or is
 it a question of being smarter about re-building those two?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Hi,
 
 I'm seeing everything built but, upon further inspection, it's only  
 because scribblings/framework got updated, so every scribbling should  
 be recompiled.
 
 Thanks for the reply and sorry for disturbing you when I thought  
 everything was getting rebuilt

Reason>>> sounds like it's working right after all
