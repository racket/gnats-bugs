>Description:
There's some ancient leftovers in `raco make': "elaboration-time
prefix", and top-level assumptions (about some "scheme" language).
They actually work for `--no-deps' which seems like it's really some
compile-toplevel-mode -- is there any reason to keep this functionality?
(If there is, then it should at least be described better...)
