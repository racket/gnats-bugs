>Description:
The code in "compiler/commands/make.rkt" implements compilation in
single worker mode, but the multiple-worker version is in a completely
different place.  I'll avoid high-level commentage, but one result of
this is that the `--disable-inlining' flag has no effect if there are
two or more jobs, and the same goes for `--vv'.

As a side note, if the `--vv' functionality stays after cleaning up
the above, then it's much more common to use `-vv' for that (each `-v'
use increments a level, rather than a new flag).
