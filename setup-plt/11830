>Description:
If you look at the third page of the quick reference from here:

  http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/pdf/quick.pdf

you'll see a bogus image that results from (circle 10).  I finally tracked it down to
the rendering in "setup/setup-unit.rkt" (which is different from the one in scribble):
all files are compiled in the same directory, and it probably assumes that "pict.pdf"
is still valid as it was created, but the file was overwritten and is now different.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile *everything* to pdf, not just one manual.

FWIW, I use:

  raco setup --no-zo --no-launcher --no-install --no-post-install \
             --no-info-domain --no-docs --no-user --no-planet --doc-pdf .

 I don't see any images on page 3. Page 4 seems okay...

 Page 4 is where the bug is -- the result of (circle 10) is a rectangle
 with labeled w h a and d.
