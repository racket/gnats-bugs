>Description:
As the subject says.  (This made the nightly build fail, since I my
own collection was left in my addons with an earlier problem in it.)

It fails for all of

  raco setup -U
  setup-plt -U
  racket -l- setup -U

And fails either with or without -j.

   I think the problem is that ccs-to-compile define has to come after 
 the code that looks at the make-user parameter and sets the 
 current-library-collection-paths parameter
