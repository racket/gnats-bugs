>Description:
If a planet link is created by executing "raco planet link" from the desired directory, with "." or "./" as the final (directory) argument, "raco setup" breaks.

However, if the planet link is created by going to the parent directory and giving just the simple directory name, the problem does not occur.
>How-To-Repeat:
~/projects/ex$ raco planet link ryanc ex.plt 1 0 .
~/projects/ex$ raco setup
