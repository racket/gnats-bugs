>Description:
Hopefully the code below is a useful test case that can be saved somewhere and run via drdr (if this doesn't seem possible, I can help get this setup as I've had to do similar things for the tool-related drracket test cases).

The bug is the 'loop' error message; the rest is correct output, I believe.
>How-To-Repeat:
- Create a new collection named 'x'. 

- Create the file x/info.rkt containing this:

#lang setup/infotab
(define scribblings '(("x.scrbl")))


- Create the file x/x.scrbl containing this:

#lang scribble/doc 
@(require scribble/manual)
@defproc

- Run 'raco setup x' and get this output:
