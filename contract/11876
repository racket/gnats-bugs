>Description:
The following datatypes do not have contracts available for them:

channel, async-channel, ephemerons, weak-boxes.

I don't think it is possible to write a combinator for higher order contracts without primitive support for these, because there is no way for a library to create a new value which responds to the corresponding predicate, but returns a different (contracted) value.

 I believe that the same is true for (counting only data with contents,
 ie not custodians, introducers, etc):
  - mutable pairs
  - continuation mark sets
  - namespaces
  - loggers
 
 And maybe some others.
