>Description:
The first-order checks performed by arrow contract projections are not the same as the first-order checks described by the #:first-order portion of the contract property.  For example, they don't take optional arguments into consideration.  An example showing the difference is included below. The or/c can't distinguish which contract to apply via the #:first-order checks, even though ctc1 can't be applied to f successfully since ctc1's projection does more strict first-order checking.

I'll fix the library so that they are, and that way the checks will be consistent.  Really, this just means fixing up check-procedure to be the definitive first-order checker for arrow contracts, and to make it either return #f or throw a contract error depending on whether we have blame information, similar to how the first order checks for unit/c and class/c are factored out.

Also, I'll fix ->d so that it has a useful #:first-order checker.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

(define ctc1 (->* () (number? number?) number?))
(define ctc2 (->* () (number?) number?))
(define ctc3 (or/c ctc1 ctc2))

(define (f [x 3]) x)

(define/contract f/c1 ctc1 f)
(define/contract f/c2 ctc2 f)
(define/contract f/c3 ctc3 f)
