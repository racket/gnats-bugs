>Description:
In PR 11359, I said:

"However, in further discussion over IRC Jon has pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a short, clear section in the docs about the differences between flat and higher-order contracts, much less chaperone and proxy contracts.  I think such a section should be added and pointed at in appropriate places, such as the documentation for make-contract and friends."

This is a bug report to make sure it gets done.

 Yeah, I think that's the plan, with an appropriate margin note in the =
 Reference at the appropriate places pointing at that section.  Now that =
 we have three types of contracts, not just two, this is even more =
 important.
