>Description:
This program blames m when it should blame n for calling f with
1 argument rather than 2.

Gives:

racket/collects/racket/contract/private/blame.rkt:58:0: f: self-contract violation, received 1 argument, expected 2 non-keyword arguments
  contract from: m, blaming: m
  contract: (-> number? number? number?)
        at: unsaved-editor1183:7.21
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load
(module m racket
  (define (f x . r)
    x)
  
  (provide/contract [f (number? number? . -> . number?)]))

(module n racket
  (require 'm)
  (f 1))

(require 'n)
