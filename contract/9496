 Do you know what he means by "legacy libraries"?
 
 As far as the porting guide goes, I don't think I added anything about
 contracts to it. I guess I should?

 Oh. I never ported the old documentation. I just wrote the new docs. Oops.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 05 Oct 2011 09:43:05 -0400
Reason>>> 
The mzlib/contract library contains docs for opt->, as well
as all of the others that were missing, and there is
generally some hints on how to upgrade to racket/contract in
those docs as well too.
