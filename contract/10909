I can write this contract for append-map in racket/list 

 [append-map 
  (case-> [-> (-> any/c loa) loa loa]
          [-> (-> any/c any/c loa) loa loa loa]
          [-> (->* (any/c any/c) () #:rest loa loa) loa loa #:rest loa loa])]

and it works fine in test cases. 

The documentation for case-> seems to suggest that 
every contract clause must start with -> , which would 
be much less permissive.

 Every clause does seem to begin with ->?
