Reason>>> I'm responsible for object/c.

 Yes, you're correct.  I'm currently working on some retooling of the =
 contract system, and this will be fixed in that work.  If you need it =
 fixed earlier, let me know, and I'll see about adding a fix in the =
 current implementation.  Thanks for the bug report!

 I think this bug has been fixed and can be closed.
