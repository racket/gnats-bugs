Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sstrickl" by sstrickl at Thu, 21 Jan 2010 15:22:22 -0500
Reason>>> It's-a me, Stevie!

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sstrickl at Thu, 21 Jan 2010 15:22:22 -0500
Reason>>> Robby's asked for a special struct form for this also.  It'd be nice to figure out 
if there's some way of unifying all the ways of handling structs in forms like 
unit signatures, contract forms, and provides.  But for now, making a special 
struct form for with-contract should be doable.
