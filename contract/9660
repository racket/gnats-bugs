>Description:
It seems like adding contracts for fields in object-contract cause mutation of those fields in wrapped objects to be a no-op (no error involved, they just seem to do nothing).  The example in the steps to reproduce show the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here are two modules:

---------------
account-imp.ss:
---------------
#lang scheme

(define account%
  (class object%
    (super-new)
    (init-field [balance 0])
    (define/public (deposit n)
      (set! balance (+ n balance)))
    (define/public (withdraw n)
      (set! balance (- balance n)))))

(define (account-factory balance)
  (new account% [balance balance]))

(provide/contract [account-factory
                   (exact-nonnegative-integer?
                    . -> .
                    (object-contract
                     ;; If the field below is uncommented, then the
                     ;; updates in deposit/withdraw have no effect.
                     ;; It's not that set! errors, it seems to be a noop.
                     #;(field balance exact-nonnegative-integer?)
                     (deposit (exact-positive-integer? . -> . void?))
                     (withdraw (exact-positive-integer? . -> . void?))))])

---------------
use-account.ss:
---------------

#lang scheme

(require "account-imp.ss")

(let ([obj (account-factory 0)])
  (send obj deposit 10)
  (send obj withdraw 25)
  (printf "~a\n" (get-field balance obj)))

----------

Put these both in the same directory and run use-account.ss.  Notice that you get -15 as output.  Now uncomment the field balance entry in the object-contract and try again.  Instead of getting a contract error, or even just getting -15 again, you get 0.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sstrickl" by samth at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 15:20:41 -0500
Reason>>> obj contracts


State changed from "open" to "closed" by sstrickl at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 15:41:43 -0500
Reason>>> This was true of the old object-contract, but is no longer true since my work on 
class and object contracts. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
