>Description:
Consider the following code:

; u-sig.ss
#lang scheme
(provide u^)
(define-signature u^
  ((contracted
    (u? (any/c . -> . boolean?))
    (u (integer? . -> . u?)))))

; u-unit.ss
#lang scheme/unit
(require "u-sig.ss")
(import)
(export u^)
(define (u? x) #t)
(define (u x) x)

; main.ss
#lang scheme
(require "u-sig.ss" "u-unit.ss")
(define-values/invoke-unit u@ (import) (export u^))
(u 3)

Run main.ss and everything works fine.

Now swap the order of the definitions in u-unit.ss so that the predicate
u? is defined after the function u that uses u? in its contract:

; u-unit.ss
#lang scheme/unit
(require "u-sig.ss")
(import)
(export u^)
(define (u x) x)
(define (u? x) #t)

Now run main.ss again:

->: expected contract or a value that can be coerced into one, got #<undefined>

Two extra bits of info:
- swaping the order of u? and u in the contracted signature does not
change anything (as expected)
- switching to a non-contracted unit fixes the problem

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sstrickl" by sstrickl at Mon, 30 Nov 2009 12:59:36 -0500
Reason>>> Also unit signature/contract related.


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sstrickl at Wed, 06 Jan 2010 12:01:13 -0500
Reason>>> This is being caused by the implicit first-order check done immediately after 
definition.  It might be the case that these should be moved to the end of the 
unit body.  Will decide whether this is the case.
