>Description:
The following works as expected: 

Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.1.2.3--2011-07-13(41b66d3/a) [3m]. 
Language: racket; memory limit: 128 MB. 
> (module yup racket 

    (struct a (x y) #:transparent) 
    (struct b a (z) #:transparent) 
    (provide (struct-out a) (struct-out b))) 
> (require 'yup) 
> (struct-copy b (b 1 2 3) [z 6] [x #:parent a 2]) 

(b 2 2 6) 

However, with provide/contract instead gives an error: 
> (module nope racket 

    (struct a (x y) #:transparent) 
    (struct b a (z) #:transparent) 
    (provide/contract 
      [struct a ((x number?) (y number?))] 
      [struct (b a) ((x number?) (y number?) (z number?))])) 
> (require 'nope) 
> (struct-copy b (b 1 2 3) [z 6] [x #:parent a 2]) 

. struct-copy: identifier not bound to a parent struct in: a 
   (with "a" highlighted in the [x #:parent a 2] expression)
