>Description:
With the files listed below, running run.rkt produces this error message:

contract violation: expected <number?>, given: #f
  contract on turn-init from 
    (file /Users/robby/Desktop/x/turn.rkt)
 via 
    (file /Users/robby/Desktop/x/run.rkt)
  blaming 
    (file /Users/robby/Desktop/x/xml2.rkt)
  contract: (-> number? any)
        at: /Users/robby/Desktop/x/turn.rkt:3.19

but the blame is all wrong. It should blame run.rkt, not xml2.rkt and there should be no 'via' annotation.

(This does not happen in the racket/load version of this program.)
>How-To-Repeat:
;; run.rkt
#lang racket/base
(require "xml2.rkt" "turn.rkt")
(turn-init #f)

;; turn.rkt
#lang racket
(provide/contract [turn-init (-> number? any)])
(define turn-init void)

;; xml2.rkt
#lang racket/base

 Thanks for distilling the bug down to something, eh, small :-)

 This looks like a duplicate of PR 11084.
