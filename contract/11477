>Description:
Given:

(define A%
 (class object% (inspect #f) (super-new)))
(define/contract B%
 (class/c )
 (class object% (inspect #f) (super-new)))

The problem is that:
   (equal? (new A%) (new A%))
but
   (not (equal? (new B%) (new B%)))

I want to be able to compare objects of the same contracted class for structural equality.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sstrickl" by sstrickl at Wed, 01 Dec 2010 13:21:25 -0500
Reason>>> I'm the maintainer of class/c

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sstrickl at Wed, 01 Dec 2010 13:21:25 -0500
Reason>>> This should be revisited after I've finished reworking this part of the contract 
system to use wrappers appropriately.
