>Description:
Trying to use the htdp password servlet raises a contract error --
the one that is fixed in the repository, so this is not the problem.
The thing is that after that error is thrown, the servlet stops
responding completely -- no errors show up on the server, and the
browser simply waits until it times out.  The server is working fine
otherwise.

I don't know if this is a problem with the htdp passwords servlet
or with all servlets, but something with the sandbox environment that
the servlet is running in is clearly not working right.

Reason>>> I believe this is fixed in SVN.
