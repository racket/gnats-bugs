>Description:
When serving a static file larger than about a megabyte, some browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer) give up partway through the download.  wget will just keep trying starting over from the beginning instead of continuing where it left off.  I think there's some sort of bug (or non-standard compliance) with incremental responses.

 Turns out it's initial-connection-timeout.  When I increase it to 300
 (from 30) that 4.5MB file completes (over my 30 KB/s cable connection).
 This is not scalable, obviously, so I still think it's a bug to kill
 the connection rather than chunking it or whatever.  But at least I
 have a workaround.

 I think that there are two issues here:
 
 1. I thought that the webserver was supposed to not time out
    connections as long as stuff goes on the pipe.
 
 2. When the connection is killed, wget tries again, and it asks for
    partial content.  If the webserver doesn't handle it, it will
    simply resend the whole thing again, and wget will silently wait
    there, rolling its eyes and looking at the watch, waiting for the
    stuff that it already got to pass.  Obviously, by the time it gets
    to new stuff, the webserver just kills the connection again.

 Well, AFAIK, normal clients will ask for a file, and when the
 connection dies for some reason they will ask for partial content and
 give you the index -- a simple web server will ignore the extra
 headers and resend the whole thing, and a smart one will send an
 appropriate partial content.  So it is the responsibility of the
 server to respond with a partial content when asked by the client, but
 the client initiates the partial transfer, since it is the only
 component that knows what it has so far.
 
 (I don't know the details, but it looks like you're talking about
 something different.)

 I restarted my web-server with 299.106 and initial-connection-timeout
 of 30 (I had set it to 300 as a workaround).  wget still gives up at
 byte 1424436, from denali, and starts over at the beginning on each
 retry.  Try it again with your browser, I don't think it's specific to
 wget.

Reason>>> I have tested with wget and modified the server to set a timeout proportional to 
the size of the file when sending files. This seems reasonable, but perfection 
could be had by slowly updating the timeout as bytes are successfully sent.

 That works, thanks!  I still think it would be nice to support
 incremental responses for static files, but maybe I'll submit that as
 a separate change-request.
