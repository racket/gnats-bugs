has some horribly broken documentation: it looks like the
docs run code, but the code they run are now buggy.

[More broadly, I found the XML docs impenetrable: they repeatedly refer
to the "XML" type, but in fact it is not at all clear how to obtain a
value of said type.  It took me several minutes of REPL experimenting
to find a composition of functions that would get me the right kind of
values, and a few more when the first composition was buggy.
(Admittedly, I was watching a movie at the same time, which may have
slightly enlarged time.)]

  (file "/var/tmp/plt/collects/xml/plist.ss") broke the
  contract
    (-> symbol? external-dtd? #f document-type?)
  on make-document-type; expected <external-dtd?>, given: #f

Reason>>> Fixed the specific bug... there was an os dependency deep down
