The following is a valid cookie header in HTTP (or at least, Firefox will send it, so I'm considering it valid): a=b;c=;d="e" but web-server/http/cookie-parse.ss doesn't parse this.  Specifically, it has to case to deal with the lack of a RHS in the c= cookie.  Adding the following code:
[(lhs EQUALS) (cons $1 "")])
to line 78 (in the definition of item in the parsing grammar) fixes this problem.

 That is not a valid cookie.
 
 From RFC 2109
 
 cookie          =3D       NAME "=3D" VALUE *
 VALUE           =3D       value
 
 From RFC 2068
 
 value          =3D token | quoted-string
 
 token          =3D 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials>
 
 quoted-string  =3D ( <"> *(qdtext) <"> )
 qdtext         =3D <any TEXT except <">>
 
 The RHS has to have at least one character.
 
 What site did this come from?

 phpBB.  Sets a cookie in Firefox of name phpbb3_e1p9b_k with no content
 (note I can't distinguish here between whether the content is the empty
 string or merely isn't present).  The header Firefox sends is:
 Cookie: style_cookie=null; phpbb3_e1p9b_u=54; phpbb3_e1p9b_k=;
 phpbb3_e1p9b_sid=3fa8d7a7b65fbabcbe9b345861dc079a
 
 I concur that this behaviour violates the specification.  I suspect phpBB is
 sending a non-quoted empty string for the value and Firefox is echoing it
 back, but I haven't dug into why this occurs: I have merely observed that it
 does.

 I can't think of a case where allowing this will cause an incorrect
 parse, so I will change it and let you know. Luckily we are having a
 release soon, so it will be in that.
 
 Thank you for the report.
