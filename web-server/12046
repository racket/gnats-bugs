(include-template path) accepts only a string literal for path, but doesn't accept an expression that returns a string. This makes it very difficult to write generalised template rendering functions, etc...

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by jay at Sat, 16 Jul 2011 18:06:53 -0400
Reason>>> The whole point of templates is that they are compiled into the application (as 
discussed on the reference page and in the FAQ.) If you want something else, 
you can just use read and eval. It would be nice to support module paths or 
identifiers bound to define-runtime-path-bound things, but I don't believe 
the second is possible to determine in Racket, yet.
