>Description:
The Help Desk is no longer able to serve any content.  For example, open the help desk, click on Manuals, and then on R5RS.  The result is the following error message :

"The file you were looking for was not found on the Help Desk server."

This happens for all Help Desk content except doc.txt file.

This is with a current version of SVN and refreshed manuals (and has been reproduced on at least one other machine).

 Jay -- I tracked this bug down.  (Sorry for the weird formatting,
 these are long names.)  The problem was that
 
   complete-developer-configuration/vhosts
   complete-configuration
 
 were the same.  It looks like you removed the first one, then changed
 the help-desk code to use
 
   build-developer-configuration
 
 but that one uses
 
   complete-developer-configuration
 
 which is different than the above two.  I tried to verify this by
 changing
 
   build-developer-configuration
 
 to use
 
   complete-configuration
 
 and things ran fine.  I've not made any changes though -- I have no
 idea what all of these functions should do.  (We need to get it fixed
 asap.)

 Eli, that should be the correct change. I don't know why that error
 doesn't show up on my machine though. Maybe it shows up on the first
 build or something?

 No -- it showed up for several people, and on the nightly build tree
 too.
