solaris
>Description:
After the "strip -S" problem is worked around, "make install" fails on Solaris 8 as follows. Apparently the documentation-building process requires libcrypto to be installed?  (There is no libcrypto in Solaris 8.)  If so, is there some way to disable the need for libcrypto when configuring PLT?

 Jay -- this was in the web-server documentation, and IIRC you fixed it
 a while ago, right?  (In any case, I'll pass it to you to close.)
 
 Paul: JFYI, the failure is harmless -- so in the meantime, your
 generated plt tree should be functioning fine.

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN, by delaying error until use of hmac-sha1
