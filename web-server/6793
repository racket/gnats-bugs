>Description:
Cannot launch web-server without DrScheme (mred?) installed.  I downloaded source, compiled and installed MzScheme 206p1.  I expected the command below to launch web-server, but it failed.  Perhaps web-server should not ship with standalone MzScheme if it does not run that way.  I don't know in what version this behavior commenced; usually I install DrScheme though I never run it.
