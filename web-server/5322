>Description:
The web server configuration servlet just crashes when 
someone creates a new host and specifies a default 
directory for which the owner of the process doesn't 
have write permission.
>How-To-Repeat:
web-server -p 8080

point web browser to localhost:8080
add a host 
change the directory path for its source to some place 
 that isn't writable 
click on update 
see servlet crash 

exception doesn't show up in browser
exception only shows up in unix repl when we kill the server
