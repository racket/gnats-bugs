>Description:
The (lib "servlet-sig.ss" "web-server") library
exports structs + signatures. Accordingly, it is useful
to programs that do not use unit/sig at all, making them
have to load the unit/sig infrastructure. It would be
nice if the *-sig.ss files actually followed the convention
of only defining signatures and not real things.

Responsible changed from "gregp" to "jay" by eli at Sun, 17 Apr 2005 19:07:16 -0400
Reason>>> jay replaces gregp

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by jay at Tue, 05 Jul 2005 12:54:50 -0400
Reason>>> It seems to me that "servlet-sig.ss" should not be read as "the signature of 
servlets", but "the file from which to create unit/sig based servlets." Maybe 
this does break the "-sig.ss" convention, but I'll have to postpone till a major 
release to change the file name.

 Probably the right solution is to leave that file exporting that stuff
 as a backwards compatibility measure (imo, unit/sigs are the wrong
 interface to build servlets anyway), but to also provide a file that
 works for module-based servlets that doesn't require loading the
 unit/sig implementation. (servlet-sig.ss can re-export those
 definitions.)

 Jay,
 
 IMHO, you should consider ultimately doing away with unit/sig servlets all
 together. The one thing in the way of this is that I believe that Continue
 uses unit/sigs a lot.

Reason>>> Unit servlets are no more.
