>Description:
The Web server exposes two dangerous URLs: for
re-loading the passwords and for re-loading the
server scripts.

1. Both should be DISABLED by default.
2. The admin should be asked to pick the URLs
   at configuration time.

--- ptg 12/1/2001 A.D.
The password refreshing is idempotent if the password file hasn't changed.  If the attacker can edit the password file, the server has worse security problems anyway.

The servlet refreshing is a potential problem because it
destroys state shared by all instances of the same servlet.  Refreshing servlets should be fixed in one
of two ways:
(Using passive voice isn't helping me avoid the subject of that sentence, is it?)
 1. Refreshing servlets should be idempotent if the
    file on disk remains unchanged, analgous to 
    password refreshing.
 2. Refreshing should specify which servlets to refresh.
    This doesn't fix the problem by itself, but updating
    one servlet shouldn't mess up others.  However, it's
    already painful enough to keep refreshing them
    without having to suppy a password or which servlets
    to reload, so I think I'll stick with 1.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look up URLs in the documentation; create havoc!
