 Yes, however it would be nice to see feedback on the download progress
 prior to the whole update process being completed which can take several
 minutes.
 
 (also possibly related, the 10 second wait upon a debug report being
 confirmed, prior to returning to the help-desk page, still doesn't
 seem to work for the internal browser, but does for the external one
 I believe.)
 
 Thanks, -paul-

 With an external browser, there should be a window that shows
 each file being installed.

 Unrelated problem.  The bug report confirmation page uses a 
 snippet of Javascript (unsupported for the internal browser) 
 to get to the next page.  The hyperlink that's shown should work, 
 though.
