>Description:
Definitions from imported modules can "leak" across servlets. For example, a servlet may require (lib "file.ss") and thus allow another servlet to access its defintions (e.g. explode-path).

This can cause a problem because the leaking is not consistant. It depends on the order in which servlets are first loaded, so an erroneous servlet that does not import a library that it uses definitions from may work correctly in a test environment, but it may (and has... twice) suddenly cease to work (giving undefined identifier errors) in practice because the leakage suddenly did not occur.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create two servlets, test1.ss and test2.ss.

test1.ss:

(require (lib "unitsig.ss")
         (lib "servlet-sig.ss" "web-server")
         (lib "servlet-helpers.ss" "web-server"))


(unit/sig ()
  (import servlet^)
  (report-errors-to-browser send/back)
  (explode-path "/a/b/c/d"))


test2.ss:

(require (lib "unitsig.ss")
         (lib "servlet-sig.ss" "web-server")
         (lib "servlet-helpers.ss" "web-server")
         (lib "file.ss"))


(unit/sig ()
  (import servlet^)
  (report-errors-to-browser send/back)
  (explode-path "/a/b/c/d"))



Start a fresh instance of the webserver and access test1.ss. It will error with an undefined identifier. Now access test2.ss. It may start a file download (a consequence of feeding the result of explode-path to the browser) but, in any case, it won't give an error.

Now go back and reload test1.ss. It will again give the error.

Now, reload the servlets by going to /conf/refresh-servlets

Finally, access test1.ss again. It will not error, but instead do the file downloading as test2.ss did.


You can get similar behavior by starting a fresh web server and going to test2.ss before test1.ss.

 Sad to say, but this is just the behavior of Scheme's toplevel. The
 only way to really deal with this to use module based servlets.

 Unless they can be refreshed without restarting the web server (and I 
 haven't been able to do that with modules), module-based servlets are 
 impractical.
 
 Behavior or not, it doesn't seem right to be able to run these 
 incorrect programs under some circumstances. It's like a breach of 
 lexical scoping rules.

 That sounds like a bug. It's certainly possible for the web server to
 be able to refresh module-based servlets by making new namespaces.

 The toplevel isn't "lexical" in this sense. It's a special, funny
 place. check out the mzscheme manual and r5rs for more details, but the
 short version of the story is the toplevel works by banging variables
 into some table somewhere. All toplevel (aka not lexically bound, aka
 free) variables are compiled into "look up in the table". definitions
 are compiled into "mutate the table". Voila. You get the mess you are
 now experiencing.

 So what we need is a better refresh mechanism for servlets.

Reason>>> jay replaces gregp

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Wed, 24 Aug 2005 13:41:22 -0400
Reason>>> These test servlets no longer work and there appears to have been a fixed
