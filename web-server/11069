>Description:
I wrote an app for a colleague using instaweb.  I created a binary for remote distribution and ran it on Kathi's machine.

When the app fires, there's an annoying textual window; it says "Your Web application is running at <url>" (not so useful given that it also launches the browser automatically) but also "Click `Stop' at any time to terminate the Web server.", which is a meaningless command in a shell window.

When I do try to kill that window (red-X in the corner), I get an error from Windows: "... has stopped working, ... look online for a solution ..." and other frightening things.  

Given how awesome the distribution mechanism is, it'd be nice if instaweb played nicely with it.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
I assume this is what you mean web-server/insta; if you mean Instaweb, you can submit a bug report for it by clicking "New Ticket" on this page: http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=instaweb.plt&owner=schematics

The Web server tutorial reads,

"So far, to run our application, we’ve been pressing Run in DrRacket. If we were to actually deploy an application, we’d need to do this differently.

The simplest way to do this is to use web-server/servlet-env."

The reference manual for web-server/insta reads,

"If you want more control over specific parameters, keep reading about web-server/servlet-env."

What you want is to use server-env, look at the #:quit? and #:banner? options.
