>Description:
The make servlet option in the Scheme menu wraps
the file en a unit/sig-form. This implies that the definitions that are top level definition, when run from
within DrScheme, aren't top level definitions in the web server. Since that language is Advanced Student, you get
this error:

Servlet didn't load. ...collects/setup/..\..\collects\mzlib\..\..\collects\web-server\default-web-root\.\servlets\bug.scm:1:186: define: found a definition that is not at the top level in: (define x "42")

The creates servlet was (some requires removed):

(require (lib "htdp-advanced.ss" "lang")
(unit/sig () (import servlet^) 
   (define x "42") 
   (quasiquote (html () (title () "Foo") 
               (body () (unquote (begin x))))))

This was generated from this source file:

;;; Language: Advanced Student

(define x "42")

(XML-BOX
  <html><title>Foo</title> 
  	  <body>
	  	(SCHEME-BOX X)
	</body>
</html>
)

 Thanks, I confirmed the bug in 203.3 feb 7. 
 
 Paul, it looks like you mixed up language levels and units here. 
 Any chance you can take care of this via modules instead of 
 units? We had discussed this already.

 Making a Response be a valid servlet instead of requiring a servlet
 to be a unit that returns a response would eliminate the need for wrapping
 the code in a unit.  The "Make Servlet..." menu would still need to do
 something to handle the language level.  I'll see if I can work on that
 after my dissertation is out the door.

 That doesn't sound right. You need to be able to package a ton of
 functions into a single >module<. I really think it's time to look
 at dynamically required modules.

 I'd like a servlet to be either
  - a module that provides
      timeout : number
      interface-version = 'v1
      start : (request -> response)
  - a response
    These servlets would be re"load"ed for each request.  They
    would only be for beginners who don't want to know about modules or
    units.
  - a unit/sig, as is currently supported.

 This looks good to me, though I must say that cutting backward compatibility
 (i.e., dropping option 3) would no longer kill me.
