>Description:
The XML collection includes a parameter (empty-tag-shorthand) that controls whether element names are included in closing tags when writing xml.  The current default is to use truncated tags.  The parameter does not appear to be exported beyond the html collection, though, so web applications can't change the default.

The default matters because Internet Explorer chokes on truncated tags in the style and link elements needed to use CSS.  My CSS web app generated with the html collection doesn't load under IE as a result.

The parameter is defined in collects/xml/private/writer.ss.

I've manually edited writer.ss to use the 'never default instead, which fixes the problem.  Either change the default or export the parameter.  Suggest documenting this issue somewhere where those using the web server would find it.

 There is an `empty-tag-shorthand' exported by `(lib "xml.ss" "xml")':

  always
 
 Is that the right one?

 Yes, that's the right one.  It didn't seem exported up through the
 html collection, though (unless I misread the link spec).

However, I will include docmentation about repercussions of its use in web
