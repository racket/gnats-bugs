>Description:
When a servlet fails due to some run-time error, it outputs a web

page saying:



The servlet terminated abnormally.

Please ask the author to fix the problem based on the details in the Web server's log file.



However, the server doesn't print any error message to the log file.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create any servlet that causes a run-time error.

>Fix:
The server now flushes the message to stdout.

It should probably go in a separate log file, though.
