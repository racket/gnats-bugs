>Description:
In web-server/formlets, formlets use #%# as a replacement for the quasi-quote syntax to expand into an xexpr which it then can display.  However, #%# does not correctly parse unquotes nested too deeply in the structure.  For example:
(let* ((n "name")
(f (formlet (#%# (h2 ((id ,n)) "Form!") ,{ (to-string (required (text-input))) . => . var }) var))
... ;commands in let body
)
This will generate an error when it tries to display this formlet.  Replacing the formlet with: (formlet (#%# ,`(h2 ((id ,n)) "Form!") ,{ ... }) var) works (that is, replacing #%#'s quasi-quote-like behaviour with the Scheme defined quasi-quote).  If you look at the error message in the first case, it's clear the #%# macro does not recurse through the syntax to find unquotes as the base quasiquote does.
>How-To-Repeat:
See code example in description.
