>Description:
Here's the output:
pcdata-string: expects args of type <struct:pcdata>; given instance of a different <struct:pcdata>

And, for (pcdata? bodycontent) => #f

In both cases, I expected the pcdata structure in the xml library.


>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "xml.ss" "xml")
(require-library "html.ss" "html")
(define a-html (html:read-html (open-input-file "pcdata.html")))
(define body (first (html:html-full-content a-html)))
(define bodycontent (first (html:html-full-content body)))
(pcdata-string bodycontent)
(pcdata? bodycontent)
