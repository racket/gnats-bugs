>Description:
When I start the web-server (either by clicking on the icon or from the shell) the disk starts "trashing" and my system pretty much grinds to halt (no software crash though). The server usually manages to serve a few pages or servlets but things get out of hand pretty quickly. I have pasted my "configuration-table" file below if it helps (although it's quite standard). I'm on OS X 10.4.7.

((port 8080)
 (max-waiting 5)
 (initial-connection-timeout 10)
 (default-host-table
   (host-table
     (default-indices "index.html" "index.htm")
     (log-format parenthesized-default)
     (messages
       (servlet-message "servlet-error.html")
       (authentication-message "forbidden.html")
       (servlets-refreshed "servlet-refresh.html")
       (passwords-refreshed "passwords-refresh.html")
       (file-not-found-message "not-found.html")
       (protocol-message "protocol-error.html")
       (collect-garbage "collect-garbage.html"))
     (timeouts
       (default-servlet-timeout 30)
       (password-connection-timeout 300)
       (servlet-connection-timeout 86400)
       (file-per-byte-connection-timeout 1/20)
       (file-base-connection-timeout 30))
     (paths
      (configuration-root "conf")
      (host-root "default-web-root")
      (log-file-path "log")
      (file-root "htdocs")
      (servlet-root ".")
      (mime-types "mime.types")
      (password-authentication "passwords"))))
 (virtual-host-table))
>How-To-Repeat:
Just start the server, I'm pretty confident you will get the same behaviour even if you use the stock configuration since I only changed a few server parameters.

Reason>>> I use the web-server every day on that platform in many different situations. Can 
you clarify what the servlet you are running is? Also, the web-server is used in a 
fairly default set up in the Help Desk without this problem.

 Well, any of the servlets in the "example"-directory. But you don't even  
 need to access any of the servlets, the disk starts trashing just after  
 the server starts up. The Help Desk seems to work fine though, I've been  
 using it quite extensively lately without any problems.
 
 I suspect that the disk trashing is due to some kind of memory "leek"  
 though since the memory usage of the process sky-rockets (it seems to eat  
 up about 5-10 MB per second on my system) and when real memory runs out it  
 resorts to virtual memory hence the disk trashing. When I kill the server  
 everything else seems paged out to disk because no matter what running  
 application you access it suddenly involves a lot of disk access  
 (presumably to fetch pages from disk).

 Seeing as I cannot recreate the experience.
 
 Can you either
 
 (a) set me up with ssh access to your machine and we can try to  
 figure it out
 
 or
 
 (b) write a script (using wget or lynx maybe) that runs the server  
 and hits a few example scripts. run that script while recording the  
 output of "top -tl 10 | grep mzscheme".
 
 Also, try using 3m and let me know if you have the same experience.
 
 Jay

 Hi Jay, 
 
 Good news. I downloaded the 351 release and the problem seemed to have  
 disappeared. I have no idea why but I read in the changelog that the  
 mzscheme gc was upgraded (even though we of course don't know if that had  
 anything do to with it). I think I found another bug in the 351 release  
 though although this one should be easier. For more details see the bug  
 report I just filed. 
 
 Anyway, thank you very much for looking into the issue in such a prompt  
 manner. 
 
 Warm regards, 
 
 Tobias Gerdin
