>Description:
The web-server cannot serve files which contain spaces in
their names, as these are sent as %20 in html, and the
web server does not translate the %20 sequence into white
space prior to looking up the file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Place a file with a name containing white space in a directory
served by the web-server.  Try to access it from a browser.
>Fix:
This no longer happens in version 206.1
The %20 is stripped out by decode-some-url-parts
