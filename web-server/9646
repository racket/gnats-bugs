>Description:
Dear PLTers,

A year or so ago I submitted a patch to the web server to enable it to cope with HTTP "Range" headers when serving static content. In the patch I included an expression that would print an error message if the header parsing failed.

It turns out that that parsing fails quite regularly when the web browser prematurely terminates the connection with the server (if the user hits refresh or surfs to another page). There are no other adverse side-effects - just the error message.

I'm of the opinion that the message can (and should) be removed. The code is in a with-handlers statement, on lines 256 and 257 of plt/collects/web-server/private/response.ss. The remainder of the with-handlers is all okay: the web server sends a "bad headers" response to the browser as recommended in the HTTP spec.

Cheers,

-- Dave
