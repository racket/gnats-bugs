>Description:
I want to serve files from somewhere other than
plt/collects/web-server/default-web-root.  I followed the directions:

1. Start the web server:
    dbtucker@church:~> web-server -p 7673 
2. Go to http://localhost:7673/
3. Change config path to /home/dbtucker/compcc/configuration-table
4. It doesn't exist.  Select "copy".
5. Restart the web server:
    dbtucker@church:~> web-server -p 7673 -f ~/compcc/configuration-table 
6. Go to http://localhost:7673/
7. Go to configuration.  It still says:
    /home/dbtucker/plt/collects/web-server/configuration-table

Why doesn't it point to the new config table?

Here's a humble suggestion: how about creating a simple (and documented)
non-web configuration interface for those of us who know what we're doing?

All I really want is to say "web-server port directory" and have it serve away.
Or even "web-server config", with a slightly more elaborate config, but one
that is (a) documented, and (b) works.  Take a look at Apache's httpd.conf.
