 I think there should be an additional argument `port' to
 `serve' in collects/web-server/internal-server.ss, around
 line 56, before the (let ([listener ...]) ...) argument.
 
 Robby, do you agree?

 sorry -- I'm out of town, so I won't be able to look into this before
 Monday or Tuesday. A quick glance at the file is confusing to me -- I
 don't think that I edited those particular lines.
 
 I'm including ptg on this message in case something changed in his side
 (since this is a call to one of his functions).

 Yes.

 Not sure why it occurs of a sudden, but the change I suggested seems to
 make the error disappear (and fits the documented interface).

 Do you mind fixing and committing it then, and perhaps adding the
 contract that would have been violated?
 
 I can do it too, if you'd like.

 The second argument to serve shold be the port and the let should
 disappear, I think.

 Okay, I checked in the change.  The internal browser starts fine from
 within DrScheme.
 
 Shall I close the bug report, or is there an OSX issue?
