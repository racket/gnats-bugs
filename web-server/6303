>Description:
When the web-server's log file is moved and compressed during the web-server's
operation, the web-server does not create a new one.  I'm guessing that
there's a stream error that's just being ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start a web-server process.  While it's running, rm the log file.  Hit the
web server to generate a log file entry.  No log file created.

 rm doesn't delete the file, it just removes a reference from the file's
 directory.
 
 As long as the web server keeps a reference to the file, the file still
 exists, taking up disk space and being appended.

 Okay, then, consider the rotation of log files; I move and compress the 
 log file.  Presumably, what you've said of rm is also true of what gzip 
 does to the original file.  In this instance, it would seem to be a bad 
 idea for the web server to continue to write to a file that is no 
 longer reachable.
 
 In a 'real' web server, does the server open the log file each time a 
 note is to be written?  Does it check to see whether the file it's 
 writing to still has the same name?  What's the best solution to this?

 I completely agree. I meant only to explain potentially confusing Unix
 behavior.

 No idea. I think the web server needs to provide an interface for
 switching/rotating logs.

 The log stuff needs improvement.  Communicating to an external program 
 for logging
 or at least catching exceptions and creating new log files would help.
 I won't get to it right away, though.

 Yes, that seems like a much better idea than fighting with the OS.  I 
 forgot that we don't have to do that if we *are* the OS.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
web server



Responsible changed from "gregp" to "jay" by eli at Sun, 17 Apr 2005 19:07:45 -0400
Reason>>> jay replaces gregp

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Mon, 23 May 2005 12:29:07 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in exp. Although, a better fix could be imagined that did not open the log 
file every time to write, if there was an error that was given when the file is 
moved. If there IS an error, than its not clear from the docs.
