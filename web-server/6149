>Description:
The web server typically responds with a "not found" error when requesting a document that does not exist.  (Which is typically conf/not-found.html).  However if you request a document in conf/ that is not found, the server does not respond with any data.  I believe it should respond with the "not found" page.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by gregp at Wed, 05 May 2004 15:39:54 -0400
Reason>>> It was rasing an exception that was trapped and never reported rather than 
responding with the correct behaviour. This has now been fixed in both exp 
and 299 versions with a test case added to suite.ss
