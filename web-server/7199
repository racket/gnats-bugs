>Description:
Error messages from the web server show the text of an error, but 
do not say where in the source the error occured, nor do they give 
a stack trace. If the web developer gets the message:

The following error occured: car: expects argument of type <pair>; given ()

He has very little help in finding the error, especially because
car may have been called from a library function, and not from his
own code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following servlet to a file in the servlets directory and
access it with a web browser.

(require (lib "unitsig.ss")
         (lib "servlet-sig.ss" "web-server")
         (lib "servlet-helpers.ss" "web-server"))

(unit/sig ()
  (import servlet^)
  (report-errors-to-browser send/back)
  
  (car ())
)

 FWIW, you should be able to do this:
 
   setup-plt --mode errortrace
 
 and then run the web server like this:
 
   mred -q -L errortrace.ss errortrace -L gui-launch.ss web-server
 
 After that, you should see the stack trace printed out 
 
 The web server may be doing something to break this, but most mred
 programs would work like that. 
 
 In particular, if the web server is catching the exception and printing
 it out, something like this:
 
   (with-handlers ([... (lambda (exn) (display (exn-message exn) ...))])
     ... call servlet ...)
 
 then you'll need to replace the `display' with a call to the
 error-display-handler.
 
 (This is (essentially) equivalent to running in debug mode inside
 drscheme.)
 
 Hope that helps.

 Thank you, I was able to get this to work.
 
 setup-plt doesn't take a --mode switch in 208, however. I installed my 
 own error handler in the servlet, which calls errortrace-lib.ss's 
 print-error-trace.
 
 It would be really nice to see some version of this make it into the 
 web-server's distribution.

 Oh, right. I should have realized you'd be interested in 208.
 
 In 299, the --mode errortrace produces additional .zo files (in
 compiled/errortrace/*.zo) that have the errortrace annotations compiled
 in. In 208, since you don't have those .zos, you'll have be sure to
 delete .zo files for any files you expect to show up in the stack trace
 (if you get a confusing stack trace, in fact, go delete all .zo files
 and try again; it'll take forever, but it may help).
