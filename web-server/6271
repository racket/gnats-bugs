>Description:
The web-server documentation says that if you have a servlet in:

http://host/servlets/my-servlet

Then you can use the url:

http://host/servlets/my-servlet/extra/path

and "extra/path" will be available to my-servlet in the uri portion of the initial request.

This does work if you hit my-servlet and then my-servlet/extra/path, but not if you try the extended version right after starting the web-server, before trying just the servlet by itself.

To reproduce, save the supplied module as "get" (no .ss or .scm) in your servlets directory, then try to hit servlets/get/abc/xyz, then servlets/get (no trailing slash), then servlets/abc/xyz again.

You should see "file not found," then "no extra path," then "extra path found."
>How-To-Repeat:
(module get mzscheme
  (require (lib "servlet.ss" "web-server")
           (lib "servlet-sig.ss" "web-server")
           (lib "servlet-helpers.ss" "web-server")
           (lib "file.ss")
           (lib "url.ss" "net"))
  (provide interface-version timeout start)

  (define interface-version 'v1)
  (define timeout +inf.0)

  ; start : request -> response
  (define (start initial-request)
    (let ([file-name (extra-path initial-request)])
      (if (not file-name)
          `(html (body "no extra path"))
          `(html (body "extra path found")))))
  
  (define my-path "/servlets/get")

  (define (extra-path request)
    (let* ([url (request-uri request)]
           [path (url-path url)])
      (let ([rp (find-relative-path my-path
                                    path)])
        (if (string=? rp my-path)
            #f
            rp))))
  
  )

Responsible-Changed-When: Thu May 15 15:31:55 2003
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    .
Responsible changed from "ptg" to "jay" by jay at Sat, 21 Jan 2006 14:15:28 -0500
Reason>>> mine

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by jay at Wed, 08 Nov 2006 12:54:10 -0500
Reason>>> See below.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Wed, 08 Nov 2006 12:54:10 -0500
Reason>>> The web-server cannot distinguish between a user that intends `get' to be a 
directory. Programs like this will work when I rework the URL -> proc mapper.
