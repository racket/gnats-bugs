>Description:
There are some problems with file paths in the PLT web server: Servlet-message is searched in the wrong place when the servlet throws an error.

See the log below:

> Servlet didn't load:
> call-with-input-file: cannot open input file: "/.../pltws/default-host/servlets/./default-host/configuration/servlet-message.txt" > (No such file or directory; errno=2)

See also the configuration below:

...
(messages
	(servlet-message "servlet-message.txt")
	(authentication-message "authentication-message.txt")
	(servlets-refreshed "servlets-refreshed.txt")
	(passwords-refreshed "passwords-refreshed.txt")
	(file-not-found-message "file-not-found-message.txt")
	(protocol-message "protocol-message.txt")
	(collect-garbage "collect-garbage.txt"))
...
(paths
	(configuration-root "configuration")
	(host-root "default-host")
	(log-file-path "logs/log.txt")
	(file-root "static")
	(servlet-root ".")
	(mime-types "configuration/mime-types.txt")
	(password-authentication "configuration/passwords.ss")))) ; 	...
