>Description:
When exposed to more than one simultaneous request from the Apache "ab" program, "custodian has been shut down" error is raised in serve/servlet.  Failure happens within a few hundred requests, sometimes a couple of thousand requests on this OSX Snow Leopard as well as a debian squeeze also running racket 5.2.0.6.  With no simultaneous requests (i.e. not using -c 2), there is no failure.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require web-server/dispatch 
         web-server/servlet-env
         web-server/http/xexpr)

(define-values (the-dispatch the-url)
  (dispatch-rules
   [("account" "sample") sample ]))

(define (sample req)
  (response/xexpr
   `(html
     (body
      (p "Hello custodian")))))

(serve/servlet the-dispatch
               #:stateless? #t
               #:banner? #f
               #:port 55555
               #:servlet-regexp #rx""                                    
               #:launch-browser? #f)

Then hit it with Apache benchmark with a -c 2 option to cause simultaneous hits.

 Thanks, many thanks.  I looked at the thread code and it clearly was not a
 small thing to fix.  I'll start by saying thanks and finish with doing some
 testing.
 
 By the way, I'm using this for real hiding behind Nginx.  I let nginx serve
 the static stuff and be an HTTP 1.1 front end and Racket do the logic.  I
 oscillated between using the stateless Racket web server as the backend and
 Racket as an SCGI server.
 
 Thanks again to you and your co-racketeers.
