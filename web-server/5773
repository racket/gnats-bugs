Problem
-------
I installed the mzscheme rpm and uploaded my web pages.
I kept getting the a "404 page not found", although it
ought to run the servlet. An add.ss servlet in the same
directory ran. ?

Solution
--------
It turned out that I had uses an (require "html.ss" "html")
but the html collection was not in the rpm. 

Conclusion
----------
I would have expected the web server to report the error,
but nothing was written to standard error nor to the log.

Conclusion:
I would like to see the actual error in stead of a 404 :-)
