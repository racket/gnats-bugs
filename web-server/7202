>Description:
In CGI programming the PATH_INFO environment variable holds any extra path information.  For example, if the script is at

   /servlets/script.ss

but accesses via the path

   /servlets/script.ss/foo/bar

PATH_INFO is /foo/bar

The web-server should provide this information.  Currently (in 208, 209, and 299.24) it provides the full path (so /servlets/script.ss/foo/bar in the example above).  The script must know its own location to parse out the PATH_INFO.  This makes servlets unnecessarily brittle; better if the web-server provided it.

Feel free to email me about this problem; I'll fix if someone points me to the relevant code and checks my changes.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gregp" by eli at Fri, 21 Jan 2005 19:18:46 -0500
Reason>>> web-server


Responsible changed from "gregp" to "jay" by eli at Sun, 17 Apr 2005 19:10:15 -0400
Reason>>> jay replaces gregp


State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Tue, 22 Nov 2005 16:53:14 -0500
Reason>>> The procedures related to 'servlet-url's have been added. The PATH_INFO is 
accessible via, (servlet-url-extra-path (uri->servlet-url (request-uri a-
request))). This structure is useful for other reasons as well, that are pending 
documentation.
