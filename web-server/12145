>Description:
When the web-server serves a file whose MIME type cannot be determined by the mime-types file, I think it should leave out the Content-Type header, rather than defaulting to TEXT/HTML-MIME-TYPE, so that the client can either guess or use application/octet-stream, as specified by 7.2.1 of RFC 2616:

    If and only if the media type is not given by a Content-Type field, the recipient MAY attempt to guess the media type via inspection of its content and/or the name extension(s) of the URI used to identify the resource. If the media type remains unknown, the recipient SHOULD treat it as type "application/octet-stream".

Note that there currently doesn't appear to be a way to get the web-server to send an HTTP response without a Content-Type header, but if you set the mime field of the response struct to #"", the Content-Type header will be empty, and at least Chromium and Firefox seem to treat that the same as leaving it out.
>How-To-Repeat:
Browse a file whose extension is not listed in your mime-types file.  It shows up as html (i.e. proportional font and no line breaks), rather than plain text or a file save prompt.

Reason>>> The Web server does not have a default MIME type, instead it requires that you 
include it in the response data structure. It does force that it is always there, 
but I think from your email you're happy with letting it be blank or using the 
octet-stream default.

 I'm talking about serving files, not making response structures.  The
 filesystem dispatcher sets the MIME type to text/html by default, and
 I think it should set it to #"", or preferably leave it out altogether
 (I don't know if all browsers treat an empty Content-Type correctly).

 The file dispatcher already takes a path->mime-type function to
 customize this behavior. And web-server/private/mime-types gives you
 the ability to have the annoying part of the customization done for
 you. Is this not sufficient? Would it be better to have
 make-path->mime-type take the default as a keyword?

 I realize it can be customized, but my suggestion is that the default
 should change, i.e. make-path->mime-type should return #"" as the
 default instead of TEXT/HTML-MIME-TYPE.  (And again, I'd prefer it
 returned #f, and that this should cause the response to leave out the
 Content-Type altogether.)  I think that complies with the HTTP
 specification more closely.

 Alright, I just pushed a better solution that does exactly what you propose.
