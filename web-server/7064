>Environment:
solaris-other
>Description:
The Web server generates URLs that look like:
http://syrma:8125/servlets;id707*0/submit.ss
But they should instead look like
http://syrma:8125/servlets;id707*0_781293791/submit.ss
Where the 781293791 is arbitrary and serves as a "password" for the continuation.
