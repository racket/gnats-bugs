>Description:
For REST applications, the HTTP verb 'PUT' is significant and the PLT web server should handle this by providing access to the request content in the request structure.
>How-To-Repeat:
As this is a feature request, there are no 'steps to reproduce', however here is a patch I've been using, and it seems to work fine (request content is accessible in request-post-data/raw). Note that it's the simpler case of handling the verb 'POST'.

 I don't understand. Doesn't it already do this?
 
 Can you show a program that posts using net/url and a servlet that
 doesn't work getting the content in the released version?
