>Description:
I installed a servlet that just produced an Xexpr. Then I loaded it through
the server. I edited the servlet to produce a modified Xexpr, restarted my
browser (lynx) and accessed the servlet through the server again only to see
the unmodified output. To be sure there were no cache interactions,
I telnetted to the server and observed the same response.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
>Fix:
This is the intended behavior.  See the "Special URLs"
section of the doc.txt.  Perhaps the docs could be clearer.
