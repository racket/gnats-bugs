>Description:
When an error, such as "car: expects argument of type <pair>; given #<procedure>" occurs in the web-server, an exception is printed out without any indication of where in the code the error occured. This is true for both the launcher web-server and the text web-server.

This makes coding and debugging medium- and large-scale web applications difficult to near-impossible because searching for errors is time-consuming.

 That is what it it supposed to do.
 
 In theory it is possible to use DrScheme to develop servlets. I'm not
 sure exactly how it works, however. I could not find the documentation.
 
 Shriram supervised that work, so he may have an idea and Paul Graunke
 actually did the work, so he may be able to point you to the docs.
 
 hope that helps.

 Did you try the
    report-errors-to-browser
 function documented in the web-server collection's doc.txt?
