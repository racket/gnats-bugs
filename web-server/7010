>Description:
If the PLT web server (either web-server or web-server-text) is started with a malformed passwords file, no error is reported.

Worse, for some particular erroneous forms of the file, the server will silently refuse requests for pages, even those outside of the realm specified.  No errors are logged to the console or logfile.

I see in web-server-unit's def'n of access-denied? that you're aware of this problem on some level.  I had to dig to find that, though, so I'm sending this report anyway.

Thanks!
>How-To-Repeat:
Sample passwords file:

'(("test" "/servlets(/.*)?" ((a "apass"))))-
