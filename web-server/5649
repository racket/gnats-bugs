>Description:
In the XML documentation, 
in the def'n of Xexpr,
the second line reads:

  (list* Symbol (listof (list Symbol String)) (list Xexpr))

The end of this should be "(listof Xexpr)",
instead of "(list Xexpr)", no?

Cheers!

 Unfortunately, no.... The confusing notation is the list* notation --
 it really means:
 
   (cons Symbol (cons (listof (list Symbol String)) (list Xexpr)))

 Hmm, still confused.
 I agree, the interpretation of "list*" is what i expected. But:
 | 
 |   (cons Symbol (cons (listof (list Symbol String)) (list Xexpr)))
 | 
 This indicates that a tag can only have a single (sub)Xexpr?
 But, in general there can be many?
 An example of what i think is an xexpr, but i don't think
 matches the above:
   '(p {} "hello" " there; " (em {} "whoah nelly!") ", pardner!")
 
 ...??

 Ian is right.  I changed the doc.txt to 
  |   (cons Symbol (cons (listof (list Symbol String)) (listof Xexpr)))
 which is both technically correct and less confusing.
 
 Thanks,

 Yes, it matches fine. Cons's second argument is a list (in this case, a
 list of types). It's an abuse of notation, certainly.
 
 In other words, an xexpr is a list whose first element is a symbol,
 second element is an attribute assoc and all of the rest of thez
 elements are xexprs.
 
 This is the 210 definition:
 
 An xexpr is either:
   - (cons symbol (cons attrlist list-of-xexprs))
   - (cons symbol list-of-xexprs)
   - symbol
   - string
   - or other stuff...
 
 A list-of-xexprs is either:
   - null, or
   - (cons xexpr list-of-xexprs)
 
 An attrlist is ...
