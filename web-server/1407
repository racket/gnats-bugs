>Description:
Put this:

  <!-- what volume and issue>

in a file called tmp.xml and evaluate:

  (require-library "xml.ss" "xml")
  (xml->xexpr (call-with-input-file "tmp.xml" read-xml 'text))

and watch dr eat all available memory.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
  I added the missing eof check to read-until-string.
