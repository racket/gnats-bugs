Eg this fails pretty often, perhaps one time in four:

 How many file descriptors did you allow the server process?

 Ah, I was ignoring serve.ss.
 
 That seems to be the culprit! Increasing that to at least the number  
 of concurrent ab requests seems to make serve.ss reliable. I don't  
 understand why it (and plt-web-server) give the errors described, or  
 how the tutorial should steer clear of this pitfall, but hopefully  
 this is some help. Due to some system troubles I might not be able to  
 respond further today. Thanks - Simon

 That's what I see -

 Ah, good to know.

 Interesting. Even more interesting, I can repeatably kill OS X by  
 testing this stuff. Eg with tcp-listen's queue increased to 100 and  
 running ab -n 10000 -c 100 ... a few times, I will pretty soon see  
 either a freeze with a "you must reboot" screen, or a reboot without  
 warning. Is it just me ? I do have third-party ram in this macbook.
