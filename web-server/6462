>Description:
From the web-server's doc.txt in 205:

---
To develop module based servlets, open the module in DrScheme's
definitions window.  After clicking the Execute button, require the
module servlet development library.
  (require (lib "develop-servlet.ss"))
Then use the develop-servlet function to interact with the servlet
using a Web browser.
  (develop-servlet start)
---

Following these instructions produces an error. There doesn't 
appear to be a "develop-servlet.ss" anywhere in collects.
>How-To-Repeat:
