>Description:
I cannot seem to configure the server using configure.ss since the server says: "The servlet terminated abnormally.

Please ask the author to fix the problem based on the details in the Web server's log file."

... when I click "Update Configuration" (same error when I click "Edit Minor Details" as well). By server log file I assume it means the "log" file in the default-web-root directory. It only says the servlet was accessed:

(from "127.0.0.1" to "127.0.0.1" for "/servlets;2*3*14448769/configure.ss" at "Wednesday, July 26th, 2006 9:04:44pm")


Web-server console output:

Servlet exception:
procedure make-paths: expects 7 arguments, given 6: "conf" "/Application... "log" "htdocs" "." "passwords"

>How-To-Repeat:
I accessed configure.ss, tried to change the port number from the default 80 to 3000 and then clicked "Update Configuration". Boom.
