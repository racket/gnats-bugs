The servlet timeout kills all the connections for the servlet.

(module timeout-bug mzscheme
  (require (lib "servlet.ss" "web-server"))

  (provide start timeout interface-version)

  (define timeout 5)

  (define interface-version 'v1)

  (define (start req)
    (send/suspend
      (lambda (k-url)
        `(html (title "test")
               (a ((href ,k-url)) "Next"))))
    (sleep 20)
    (send/suspend
      (lambda (k-url)
        '(html (title "second test")
               "Won't get here")))))

Reason>>> web-server


Responsible changed from "gregp" to "jay" by eli at Sun, 17 Apr 2005 19:09:23 -0400

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by jay at Fri, 20 May 2005 19:30:32 -0400
Reason>>> What you have written demonstrates the purpose of the timeout value. It is set 
as a timeout for the k-urls, so that old k-urls die. Am I missing something?

 This was documenting a subtle interaction bug between servlets; however, the 
 code to repeat it does not clarify what exactly this bug was, and I've 
 forgotten since I opened it 7 months ago. Feel free to close it.
