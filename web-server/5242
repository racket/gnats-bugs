>Description:
The Web server's default startup page presents several
options, including one on "embedding interface".
The resulting documentation is woefully outdated.

While we're at it, on the Web server monitoring page,
there's a missing "seconds" before "then" in

  does not respond within server-response-timeout-seconds then 

Also, that page does not list the default values for
any of the optional arguments.  (I can guess the default
port value, but have no idea what the defaults would be
for the other two.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Start up server.
Connect to default page.
Click on "the server" (which link, btw, should really be
moved to "Find out more").
Click on "Embedding Interface".
Check out the interface on `serve'.
>Fix:
copy text from doc.txt and correct other glitches
