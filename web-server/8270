>Description:
When I run the handin-server, I get this error:
  tcp-accept: expects argument of type <tcp-listener>; given #<struct:ssl-listener>
I traced this to the place where the embedded web-server is invoked.  My guess is
that somewhere in the webserver something changed and it uses tcp-accept directly
instead of what it gets from the net:tcp^ signature.

(We need a solution for this soon since we use it in two courses.)

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by jay at Thu, 07 Sep 2006 18:48:38 -0400
Reason>>> I've switched to using run-server from (lib "thread.ss") and I must pass it tcp-
accept/enable-break; however, that is not in the net:tcp^ sig. Can it be added? 
Who is responsible for updating the ssl collection to include it as well?


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by jay at Mon, 18 Sep 2006 13:33:47 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. Some code in net/tcp-redirect.ss should go in mzlib/async-
channel.ss
