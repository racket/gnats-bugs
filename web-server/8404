>Description:
The file mime.types contains lines such as

    text/html			html htm

The parser in /collects/web-server/private/mime-types.ss uses
read-line, which returns the above as

    "text/html			html htm\r"

The current implementation doesn't remove the trailing \r,
so the code registers "html" and "htm\r" as extensions having
the mime type text/html.

This implies that the mimetype of "index.htm" becomes the default
(i.e. "text/plain").


How to fix: Remove trailing whitespace from the line immediately
            after reading the line.

In /collects/web-server/private/mime-types.ss 

add
    (require (lib "13.ss" "srfi"))

and in the body of make-get-mime-type change

     (match (readline)

to
     (match (string-trim-right (read-line) char-whitespace?)

 It should probably be (read-line 'any) -- can you test that on your windows box?

 (read-line 'any) will solve the immediate problem.
 
 On second thought, a better solution might be to change
 
      (regexp-split #" " exts)
 
 such that any whitespace character (not only space)
 can be written between and after extensions.
