>Description:
When running the web server (PLT Web Server Text.exe) as a non-admin, it uses an insane amount of memory for simply dispalying static content. On my machine, it uses in excess of 600MB before exhausting memory and crashing. However, if I run the same configuration as an administrator on the local machine, it runs just fine.

This may be a permissions issue, but I have not had the time to inversitage further.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the web server as a non-admin. Watch it crash and burn.
Run the web server as an admin. Watch it hum along nicely.

Reason>>> This was/is caused by inability to write the log file. It has been fixed in SVN.
