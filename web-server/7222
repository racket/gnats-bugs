(module j mzscheme
        (provide interface-version timeout start)
        (define interface-version 'v1)
        (define timeout +inf.0)
        (define (start req)
          `(html (body "Here's some Japanese: ???"))))
>Fix:
Looks like the content length is being computed from the string-length, not the length of the bytes.

Reason>>> Is the problem that you are not telling the browser that you are sending utf8 
and that IT uses the wrong interpretation of the length? That's what Safari 
does with your example, but not with the following:

(module sr7222 mzscheme
        (provide interface-version timeout start)
        (define interface-version 'v1)
        (define timeout +inf.0)
        (define (start req)
          `(html (head (meta ([http-equiv "Content-type"]
                              [content "text/html; charset=utf-8"])))
                 (body "Here's some Chinese: ?????"))))

State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by jay at Wed, 08 Nov 2006 13:02:27 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN a few months ago.
