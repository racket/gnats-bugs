>Description:
Could servlets have something like

  (redirect-to a-url)

instead of a response?  The server would treat this 
like an HTTP request for the page denoted by `a-url'.

If we had this, we could avoid the META redirections in
Help Desk.

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
This functionality is already provided with make-response/full, but the programmers must know the
details of HTTP.

I added a redirect-to helper function and documented it.
