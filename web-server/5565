(send/suspend
 (build-suspender &apos;("Test of Page 2")
                  &apos;((input ([type "submit"][value "pls test with and without topping"])))))

(define q
  (send/suspend
   (build-suspender &apos;("Bug")
                    &apos;((input ([type "text"][name "x"]))))))

(send/suspend
 (build-suspender &apos;("Result of test")
                  (list r)))
>Fix:
Matthew pointed out that the define construct does not allow redefinitions in student languages.  Right now, I don't know what to do about the problem.
