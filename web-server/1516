>Description:
In the HTML library,
(make-object (listof attributes (listof Contents-of-object-applet)))
conflicts with the Object superclass.  I suppose it should be renamed.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "html.ss" "html")
(make-object frame% "frame" #f 800 800)
>Fix:
Everything from html.ss in the html collection is now prefixed with "html:"
This will avoid the make-object name collision while keeping the naming of
structures representing html tags uniform.  It should also prevent any future
name collisions as html evolves.
