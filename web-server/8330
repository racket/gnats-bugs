>Description:
The web-server collection procedure "report-errors-to-browser" doesn't seem to work anymore.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module bug mzscheme
  (require (lib "servlet.ss" "web-server"))
  (provide interface-version timeout start)
  (define interface-version 'v1)
  (define timeout +inf.0)
  (define (start request)
    (report-errors-to-browser send/back)
    (/ 1 0)))

Instead of reporting the error to the browser, the response is an empty page, and the following is printed to the web-server process's stderr:

exception raised by exception handler: continuation application: attempt to cross a continuation barrier; original exception raised: /: division by zero

Reason>>> report-errors-to-browser has been removed in favour of with-errors-to-
browser, which works.

 Where is with-errors-to-browser documented?  Searching help-desk comes
 up empty, and it's not in the web server manual dated Sept 2.  Is
 there a recent-changes file?  I would really like to see these changes
 announced in the main PLT Scheme new version announcements.

 It is documented in the Scribble documentation. The Help Desk does not
 yet support displaying this, so I've put a temporary copy at:
