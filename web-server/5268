>Description:
start drscheme in directory with "teachpack.ss"
set teachpack to "servlet.ss"

execute the following program: 
(send/suspend 
 (lambda (url)
   `(html
     (form ([action ,url][method "post"]) (input ([type "submit"][name "SUBMIT"]))))))

get this error message on the following interaction: 
build-path: expects type <string or 'up or 'same> as 2nd argument, given: '..; other arguments were: "C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM" "command.com"
>How-To-Repeat:
What bugs me most is that this is obviously a case 
of not even testing platform dependent code. 

ARGH!!!
