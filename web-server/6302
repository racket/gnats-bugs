>Description:
My digital camera generates files whose names end in .JPG (uppercase).
The PLT web server (web-server collection) serves these files as text/html,
rather than image/jpeg.  This causes some browsers (namely, Mozilla) to
display the jpeg source as text.  The get-mime-type function in 
plt/collects/web-server/web-server-unit.ss ought to convert the file
extension string to lowercase before looking it up in MIME-TYPE-TABLE.

>How-To-Repeat:
Put an image file in htdocs named foo.JPG, then view it in Mozilla.

Reason>>> Fixed in exp tagged version as well as v299 tagged version.
Now file extensions will be treated in a case insensitive manner WRT mime 
types.

 OK, I have fixed this in the exp version and in the v299 version.
 
 File extensions will now be treated in a case insensitive manner with  
 respect to mime types.
