>Description:
When Instaweb is running the server, until you click Stop, you can do almost nothing.  The menus seem to work, but you certainly can't edit, and even F1 doesn't seem to work.

I thought DrRacket was an operating system and a client could not starve it.  Maybe the editor is part of the running program (really?), but shouldn't the help key be outside it?

 The editor is locked while the program is running.

 I ran this program:
 
   #lang web-server/insta
 
   (define (start request)
     `(html (head (title "Hello world!"))
            (body (p "Hey out there!"))))
 
 
 waited for the web browser to appear, switched back to drr and hit f1.
 Sure enough, I got docs.

 Ah, I see, there's some interaction with a call to SYSTEM and i/o.
 It's not DrRacket to blame.  Thanks!
