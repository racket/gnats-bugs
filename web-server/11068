 I can't reproduce this. Either way it seems like a DrRacket error
 rather than a Web server error.

Reason>>> If this is an error (I don't think it is), then it is in the domain of DrRacket.

For example, this program:

#lang racket/base

(thread (&#955; () (8 7)))

(with-handlers ([exn:break? (lambda (exn) (printf "Done\n"))])
  (semaphore-wait/enable-break (make-semaphore 0)))

when run with debugging will first highlight (8 7), then when you click stop, that 
highlight will disappear and the REPL will show "Done".

In contrast, this program:

#lang racket/base

(thread (&#955; () (8 7)))

(with-handlers ([exn:break? void])
  (semaphore-wait/enable-break (make-semaphore 0)))

does not cause the highlight to be removed.

Finally, this program:


#lang racket/base

(thread (&#955; () (8 7)))

(semaphore-wait/enable-break (make-semaphore 0))

causes the highlight to be removed and instead put on the semaphore-wait 
expression.

This final example shows how this "problem" probably cannot be resolved 
adequately until DrRacket supports multiple error highlights better.

N.B. I don't think this is an error, because I don't see any use case for pressing 
stop and still seeing the error, because if you tried to do anything after stop (ie 
use the REPL or editor), then it is designed to disappear anyways. So you have 
the same capabilities before and after Stop.

 Yes, DrRacket treats a break as an error (it shows up as an exception)
 so the stack-less break exception is what gets highlighted and causes
 confusion.
 
 I'll move this to SK and he can close it or make some comment.
