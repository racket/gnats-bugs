>Description:
if servlet produces html code with some images and links to this images are relative, than web-server doesn't process this links correct. As i understand this is because web-server treats any query whith "/servlets/" in its path as a query to servlet and a query like "/servlets/example1/a.gif" is treated as query to servlet "a.gif". May me there are other ways to produce html code whith images from servlets? In my case i changed servlet-bin? predicate in web-server to check if query is end with ".ss" string and i removed servlets directory to htdocs directory. This works well but what is the right way?
>How-To-Repeat:
Servlet example:
(require (lib "unitsig.ss")
         (lib "servlet-sig.ss" "web-server"))

(unit/sig () (import servlet^)
`("text/html"
  "<html>
    <head><title>Hello world</title></head>
    <body>
      <p align='center'><img src='Logo.gif'></p>
    </body>
   </html>"

 Paul, can you just document the existing behavior properly and suggest
 that people who produce servlet responses point to links in htdocs? 
 
 Thanks -- Matthias

Responsible-Changed-From-To: steck->gregp
Responsible-Changed-By: eli
Responsible-Changed-When: Sun, 28 Mar 2004 04:22:20 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:
web server

Edit:
  https://internal.plt-scheme.org/bugs/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=edit&pr=6147&database=default
State changed from "open" to "closed" by gregp at Fri, 20 Aug 2004 15:31:58 -0400
Reason>>> Why not just use relative path like "../logo.gif" which is still relative but
points to a non-servlets directory?
