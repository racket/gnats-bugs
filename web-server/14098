>Description:
Racket does not appear to respect the HTTP RFC for the Host field (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.23). In my testing I found that when the URL contained a port, it was not sent along w/ the request:

e.g,

```
PUT /path/to/something/ HTTP/1.1\r
Host: localhost\r
Accept-Encoding: gzip\r
Content-Length: 49\r
Accept: application/json\r
X-auth-token: #f\r
Content-type: application/json\r
Content-encoding: gzip\r
\r
```

even if the url looked something like http://localhost:9990/path/to/something.

The Port need not be sent if it's default (port 80), but otherwise should be sent. 
>How-To-Repeat:
(require net/url)
(define url "http://localhost:9990")
(get-pure-port "http://localhost:9990")

Setup a listener with something like socat:

$ socat -d -v -v tcp-listen:9990 -
