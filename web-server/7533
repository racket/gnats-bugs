>Description:
It appears that the `time-bomb' that clears out old sessions after
a period of inactivity is incorrectly ignoring any user interactions,
so if a session starts at 2:00PM and the session timeout is 60 seconds
that session will expire at 2:01PM regardless of whether a user
is interacting with it or not. This is in contradiction to the manual,
which says that the servlet-timeout is how long the server will wait
between requests before it evicts a session's continuations from the
table. (Incidentally the documentation also says that the default
value of this parameter is 120 seconds, but the code and empirical
measurements say it's 60.)

My reading of the code leads me to believe the problem is that nothing
other than adjust-timeout! (only ever called directly by the user) 
calls RESET-TIMER from the timer.ss module; it seems like the function
that resumes a continuation should stop the timer  (to avoid 
penalizing the user for slow scripts) and then start a new
one when it send/suspends again.

The current behavior leads to cryptic, nondeterministic crashes that
have no obvious connection to timeouts (particularly baffling because
the "missing k-url" error message is the same as the "file not found"
error message) and are a royal pain to debug. Please change it to do
what the docs say, rather than changing the docs to say what it does.
>How-To-Repeat:
I used this servlet:

(unit/sig ()
  (import servlet^)

  (define (start)
    (define start-time (current-seconds))
    (let loop ((last-time start-time))
      (let ((time (current-seconds)))
        (send/suspend
         (lambda (k)
           `(html
             (form ((action ,k) (method "post"))
                   (p ,(format "It has been ~a seconds since starting (~a seconds since last iteration)."
                               (- time start-time)
                               (- time last-time)))
                   (input ((type "submit")))))))
        (loop time))))
  
  (start))

Clicking the button about every five seconds, I got:

It has been 0 seconds since starting (0 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 2 seconds since starting (2 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 5 seconds since starting (3 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 10 seconds since starting (5 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 14 seconds since starting (4 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 20 seconds since starting (6 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 25 seconds since starting (5 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 30 seconds since starting (5 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 35 seconds since starting (5 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 41 seconds since starting (6 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 47 seconds since starting (6 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 52 seconds since starting (5 seconds since last iteration)
It has been 57 seconds since starting (5 seconds since last iteration)

And then a crash.
