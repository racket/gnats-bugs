>Description:
The XML collection used to accept an empty body for a tag.
It no longer does.  Found this out the hard way trying to
upgrade my interview talk for v102.

Would appreciate a real quick fix to this, since I need
it for my talk.  Thanks.

memq: not a proper list: #f

>Fix:
empty-tag-shorthand should not be #f.  I added a guard to provide a better
error message sooner.

 Addendum: this bug only occurs when the the empty-tag-shorthand flag
 is set to #f.
