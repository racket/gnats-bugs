>Description:
If send-url does not reuse the browser window, which is now
unavoidable in some situations, then too many browser windows
are stuck spinning.  Once the maximum simultanious connections
is reached, the frustrated user cannot interact with their
servlet further without manually killing other windows.

To Fix:

Change the development environment to send the responses to the waiting browser, if there is one.  Detecting if the browser is really still waiting could be slightly tricky
and require an extra server hook.
