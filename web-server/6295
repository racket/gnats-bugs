>Description:
In the default web-server configuration, the
`servlet-root' path is ".". This path does not mean
"current directory" under Mac OS Classic. As
a result, the "Customize" link in the default
pages doesn't work.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run the web server in Mac OS 9
Try to customize the configuration

 Matthew,
 
 I can't reproduce this one on OS 10.
 
 I'm going to postpone addressing this until v299.
 
 Let me know if you there is an urgent reason to fix this prior to v299
 
 Thanks.

 It's an OS-9-only problem.

Reason>>> jay replaces gregp

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Thu, 12 Jul 2007 14:41:55 -0400
Reason>>> Now uses (current-directory) rather than "."
