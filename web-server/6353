>Description:
The `read-html-as-xml' procedure from (lib "html.ss" "html") tries to be nice about malformed entities, i.e. if it sees an ampersand followed by a string that's not a valid HTML entity, it returns the ampersand and string as-is.  But if the string contains uppercase characters, they get returned as lowercase.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (require (lib "html.ss" "html"))
> (require (lib "xml.ss" "xml"))
> (map xml->xexpr (read-html-as-xml (open-input-string "M&M")))
("M" "&m")

;; should be ("M" "&M")

Responsible-Changed-Why:
Unclaimed


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "gregp" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 02:53:04 -0500
Reason>>> xml

Responsible changed from "gregp" to "jay" by eli at Sun, 17 Apr 2005 19:07:55 -0400
Reason>>> jay replaces gregp

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jay at Thu, 23 Jun 2005 09:34:51 -0400
Reason>>> I just tested this in v299, and the problem does not appear, probably due to the 
change to case-sensitive symbols.
