State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by jay at Mon, 16 Oct 2006 13:37:33 -0400
Reason>>> Long run I plan on making the log more extensible. Right now, it should be 
easy for you to add this to the `apache' compatibility mode. Check out 
dispatchers/dispatch-log.ss and email me with questions as you try to 
implement this yourself.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by jay at Wed, 18 Oct 2006 12:52:43 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. use `extended' format.
