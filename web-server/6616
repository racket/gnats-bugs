>Description:
In the Web server, the path of a request URI handled by a servlet
can be separated conceptually into two parts: the portion of the
path that resulted in the servlet being selected for handling,
and the remainder of the path.

This separation turns out to very useful in many cases.  Web CGI
scripts access the separate path parts through the SCRIPT_NAME
and PATH_INFO variables
("http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html").

From a casual look at the code, my first guess at an efficient
way of doing this would be to add a field to the request struct
that indicates how many elements of the URI's path were used to
identify the servlet.

Standard procedures like in the following examples could use this
count information.

;; request URI "http://myhost/servlets/foo.ss/earth/us/ma":
(servlet-path request)
=> ("servlets" "foo.ss")
(servlet-path-string request)
=> "/servlets/foo.ss"
(url->string (make-servlet-url request))
=> "http://myhost/servlets/foo.ss"
(request-path request)
=> ("earth" "us" "ma")

If you decide that's the best way, and a worthwhile change,
would it be helpful for me to submit a patch?

 Greg has been working on the webserver, and AFAIK, this is one of the
 issues that he addressed.
