After leaving plt-web-server running for a while, I notice a handful of these messages in the stderr:

output-file: tcp-write: error writing (Broken pipe; errno=32) File a PLT bug report if this is on a live server!
output-file: tcp-write: error writing (Connection reset by peer; errno=104) File a PLT bug report if this is on a live server!

Let me know if you need more info.

 Doug,
 
 This comes from the server being sent a weird HTTP-Range request.
 We've implemented the RFC, but I anticipated that there might be
 "weird" clients out there. Can you give more info about what you are
 doing and (perhaps) get a tcpdump of the HTTP headers that the server
 was sent?

 I should also mention, that it does seem like this could just be a
 broken TCP connection where the exception was caught where I expected
 a range error to occur. In which case, there is no need to report it.
 If that's the case, then I will have to rework the error msg to better
 tell that situation apart.
