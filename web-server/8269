>Description:
Having only a `load-configuration' function that loads
the configuration from a file is inconvenient in many
situations.  For example, see the `config@' definition
at the bottom of
  collects/handin-server/web-status-server.ss

A function that uses an s-expression directory would
be more convenient there.

 I might sound picky, but the asymmetry of the names bothers me.
 So, instead of renaming the other thing as `load-configuration-file',
 how about calling the new function `set-configuration'?

 (It would also be a good idea to update the docs.)

 I would prefer the rename, load-configuration-file and
 load-configuration. This does not set anything, it creates a config
 object, but configuration->config is a bit odd and not with the old
 terminology.

 I don't understand.  Clearly, in the handin-server code:
 
 	(begin0
 	 (load-configuration file)
 	 (delete-file file))
 
 `load-configuration' is doing some side-effect, so if
 `load-configuration-sexpr' is the equivalent sans reading from a file,
 then it is doing the same side-effect too.

 (begin0 (X) (Y)) returns the result of (X). The result of
 load-configuration is a unit. You are giving it the name config@ and
 then using it in a call to serve.

 I missed the `0', sorry.  I blame crack and bad indentation...
