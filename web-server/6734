>Description:
A file with uppercase characters in its filename extension (e.g. "foo.JPG") will be served with the default MIME type.  Simple fix:

RCS file: /cvs/plt/collects/web-server/web-server-unit.ss,v
retrieving revision 1.21
diff -r1.21 web-server-unit.ss
444c444
< 			     (string->symbol (substring path (+ n 1) (string-length path)))
---
> 			     (lowercase-symbol! (substring path (+ n 1) (string-length path)))
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an image file named "foo.JPG" in a web server's htdocs directory.  Viewing it in a browser will display the file contents as ASCII (unless your browser is smart enough to figure out the correct MIME type on its own).

 Oops, this is a duplicate of bug 6302.  Sorry about that-- I thought
 it seemed familiar!
