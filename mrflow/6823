>Description:
Running MrFlow on code containing unsupported constructs (units, etc) gives an error, and then infinite loops.  It also does not respond to break.  Window must be closed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following code in the definitions window.  
(unit foo
      (import)
      (export)
      (define-values (x y) (values 1 2)))

Click analyze.

Reason>>> Known problem.

Reason>>> It's not an infinite loop, by the way, it's just that mrflow
doesn't currently catch expansion time exceptions.  And you
get an expansion time exception not because mrflow doesn't
support the unit construct, but because the expander doesn't
like define-value inside a unit (i.e. you'd get the same
exception if you used another tool or executed the code,
it's just that other tools handle the exception nicely while
mrflow just ignores it and happily lets drscheme itself
die instead).  It's been on my list of little bugs to
fix pretty much since mrflow exists :-)
