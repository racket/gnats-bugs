mrflow's annotations in the editor make

    Fixed.

    Fixed (but it still deletes the boxes, otherwise
    they end up in the saved file when the user explicitely
    saves it - I could maybe put them back in after the
    save using after-save-file, but it would look wierd, with
    all the boxes disappearing and then reappearing, and
    I'm not sure it's worth the trouble... comments?)
