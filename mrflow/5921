Human Language: english
>Description:
After "Analyze" is done on an open file, and "Show Type" is expanded
on a symbol; "Open Recent" will warn that "snips" must be
collapsed first, but after the warning, the window thinks the file was
swithed (but wasn't), so if the "Show Type" is removed, then "Open
Recent" is tried again, nothing happens as it thinks it already is.
(I happen to use "open/replace file in present window" if it matters)


>How-To-Repeat:
(with two "Open Recent" files, the above problem description should
be detailed enough, if not I'll elaborate further, thanks again)
