>Description:
I pressed the Analyze button with an empty defs buffer
in the MrEd language.  After getting the requisite 
message about being in the wrong language, I got two 
error dialogs, both with:

 set-gui-state-term-analysis-done?!: expects type  
 <struct:gui-state> as 1st argument, given: 
 uninitialized-gui-state-in-definitions-text-mixin; other 
 arguments were: #t
