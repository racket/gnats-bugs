>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
I define SQUARE, do flow analysis, and then click on various bits of
stuff to present the result of analysis.  I then ask to compress sexp.
This pops up a window that asks

  Do you want to invalidate the analysis and remove any boxes and arrows?

I click Yes.  This brings up a window labeled

  DrScheme Internal Error

that says

  delete in text% (no position case): expects 0 arguments, given 3: -3 -2 #f

and the resulting code looks like

  (defie
    (* x x))

and then DrScheme seems to get sort-of wedged (not totally
unresponsive, but I can't type in the defs window).
