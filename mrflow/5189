>Description:
I define the code

  (define (square x)
    (* x x))

  (square 10)

I then go to the left x in (* x x) and ask for its parent.  Good, it
draws an arrow to the x in (square x).  I now go to the x in (square
x) and ask for its children.  I expect to see one overlapping arrow,
and one new one.  Instead I get two new arrows.  The new arrow to the
left x goes to the right of the one already there.  There's a visible
difference -- I see three arrows on my screen.  See message w/
attachment sent to plt-design list.
