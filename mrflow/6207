>Description:
- Analyze incorrectly classifing non-ambigious
return value type from recursive function calls.

- Analyze occasonally corrupting formatting with "Show Type".

- Aanalyze likely needs a more user friendly "type" display format.

>How-To-Repeat:
Enter in definitions window:

 (define (neg x) (if (< x 0) x (neg (- x))))

 (neg 2)

Then analyze:

the "<" symbol is flagged in error, although with an operand value
type of <number>, the result will clearly also be <integer>, therefore
the (< x 0) will alwasys unambigiously compair <number> type values if
the function operand is of type (or subtype) <number>.

---

Select "Show Type" of "<" symbol error; a <return> charactor will be
inserted between the "(if" and "(< ...)" expressions, corrupting the
format (as it's not deleted upon upon "Hide Type")

---

Personally find type expressions like:

 (union (case-lambda [(union 2 complex compled) 0 () *-> (union #f #f)])
  (case-lambda [(union 2 complex complex) 0 () *-> (union #f #t)]))

unintelligible, would prefere type of "(< x 0)" to return something like:

 (bool (< (#t number) (#t number)))

>Fix:
thanks, we're aware of the shortcomings of MrFlow and 
are actively working on it. unlike other aspects of the env, 
this component is directly a dissertation and requires a 
different approach.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    Regarding your three points:
    
    point 1: this is the same problem you and I have discussed
    before in PR5916, which is also the same as PR5678.  It
    *will* be fixed, at some point :-)
    
    point 2: I had robby test this on his MacOSX computer,
    and no problem showed up.  Are you using the latest
    version of DrScheme / MrFlow?  Can you give us a more
    detailed description of how to reproduce the bug?  Does
    it happen every time you try?
    
    point 3: type simplification is the last big thing that
    has to be added to MrFlow before it's officially released.
    We are working on that.
