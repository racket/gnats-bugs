>Description:
The documentatation talks about "scene", but the argument is named "image".

Adds a line to the image scene, starting from the point (x1,y1) and going to the point (x2,y2); unlike add-line, this function crops the resulting image to the size of scene.

>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "sw-bug" to "doc-bug" by matthias at Tue, 27 Aug 2013 09:52:17 -0400
Reason>>> .

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "kathyg" by matthias at Tue, 27 Aug 2013 09:52:17 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Tue, 27 Aug 2013 09:52:17 -0400
Reason>>> Please recall that htdp/image distinguished a notion of 'scene' from the general 
notion of 'image' and that distinction was needed to get around pinholes as an 
overwhelming idea for beginners.  In contrast, 2htdp/image has no such needs 
but to transition from '1e' to '2e', we use scene and image interchangeably in the 
latter context. Indeed, the function is called scene+line because it re-creates the 
functionality of htdp/image in 2htdp/image (because add-line behaves in a way 
that makes world programs behave in an odd manner).
