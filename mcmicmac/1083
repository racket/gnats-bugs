 For now, I've installed a generic error message:
 
  Welcome to DrScheme Jr version 100/40, Copyright (c) 1995-98 PLT
  Language: Beginner
  > (cond ball empty)
  stdin: 2.7-2.11: Not a clause in question-answer format
 
 I still hope to make the error messages more specific, though.

 That will be great! I didn't know (remember?) that you were planning this.
