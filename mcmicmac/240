>Description:
	check syntax this fragment: 
	(define (sampling R)
	   (local ((define (square-sampling east south SQUARE)
		     (let* ((west (- east SQUARE))
			    (north (- south SQUARE))
			    (se (R (vector east south)))
			    (ne (R (vector east north)))
			    (sw (R (vector west south)))
			    (nw (R (vector west north))))
		       (cond
			 [(and se ne sw nw) 0]
			 [(or se ne sw nw) 1]
			 [else 2]))))
	     square-sampling))

	note: 
	1. the two occurrences of nw in the cond questions are not underlined. 
	2. the color of 0 and 1 is BLUE (but then again, my whole screen is
		blue)
	   the color of 2 is black

>How-To-Repeat:
	repeatable with above in my configuration
