 I have to correct what the bug report says: It's a DrScheme problem,
 not a MzScheme problem, as I had originally assumed.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

Perhaps you could be a little less terse in your description, say by
providing the error message that you received and, if necessary, the
use that triggered it.  I was able to enter and use the included
macro, even getting DrScheme to highlight an improper use.
