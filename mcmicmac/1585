 I'm puzzled that you were able to re-define #%time-apply:
 
  sun% drscheme-jr -l Inter
  DrScheme Jr is loading. Please wait...
  Welcome to DrScheme Jr version 103/1, Copyright (c) 1995-2000 PLT

  > (define #%time-apply 'haha)
  stdin: 1.9-1.21: keyword: invalid use of keyword #%time-apply
 
 [Same result in DrScheme.]
 
 Even if Zodiac were broken or circumvented, MzScheme would disallow it:
 
  > (global-defined-value '#%time-apply 0)
  global-defined-value: cannot redefine constant: #%time-apply
 
 Of course, if you're creating and using a keywordless namespace, then
 most all macros can be broken.

non-bug. Duh. Keyword enforcement is done via the namespace, not zodiac.

 Sorry about that! I did indeed change drscheme to make a keyword-less
 namespace so that I can undefine primitives that aren't in the
 language. I realized this myself just a few minutes ago as I woke up.
 Sorry for the confusion.
 
 I will close this PR.
