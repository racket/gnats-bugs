>Description:
zodiac's norm-path function doesn't properly
check the output of split-path. It is possible that
this function is called with the filesystem root (see below)
which means that build path will be called with #f as the
first argument.

This function appears to be totally superflous. I think that
it should be removed and all calls to it should be replaced
by just norm-path's argument. Perhaps someone else who
put it in knows why it should be there, so I didn't make
the change.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to a windows machine.
cd to "d:/".
start drscheme (in d:/)
set language level to mred debug
evaluate "(define-macro m x)"
get error that build-path's first argument is #f

 I just found a Windows box.  Have to figure out how to install on it.
 Will investigate.

 Certainly you can just read the documentation of split-path, right? 
 That should be enough to get things working. I don't doubt that you 
 can even reproduce this on a linux machine if you are willing to save 
 your file in the root of your filesystem.

 Aha, okay.  That's a useful tip.  Thanks.
