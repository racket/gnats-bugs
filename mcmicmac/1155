>Description:
Check Syntax provides the 'rename' choice for doing alpha-renaming across zodiac macros.  However, sometimes this doesn't work right.  Example below.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Add the following zodiac macro to drscheme (e.g., insert it in collects/
zodiac/scm-main.ss):

  (add-primitivized-macro-form 
   'schedule scheme-vocabulary 
   (let* ([kwd '(line)]
          [in-pattern '(_ <schedule-name> (line <name> <exp>) ...)]
          [out-pattern '(let* ([<name> <exp>] ...) (list (quote <schedule-name>) <name> ...))]
          [m&e (pat:make-match&env in-pattern kwd)])
     (lambda (expr env)
       (or (pat:match-and-rewrite expr m&e out-pattern kwd env)
           (static-error expr "Malformed Schedule")))))

2) Start up DrScheme, and put it in the MzScheme Debug language level.

3) enter the following piece of code:

(schedule a (line line1 3)
          (line line2 line1))

4) click execute, then check syntax.

5) everything is groovy.

6) put the mouse over one of the instances of 'line1', and select "rename"
from the contextual menu. Enter the name "abcdefg", and click OK.

7) Here's the resulting code:

(schedule a (line abcdefgfg 3)
          (line line2 abcdefg))

... in the first instance of the keyword, instead of 'abcdefg', we get
'abcdefgfg'.  It seems that if the new keyword is n characters long and the
old one is m characters long, then either the last n-m characters are
duplicated (if n>m) or the next m-n characters of the context are deleted
(if m>n).

 Renaming operates by sorting all of the occurrances of the variables in
 the program and renaming them from the end of the buffer backwards. So,
 to see why this funnieness happens, check the zodiac expanded version
 of that code. There are some identifiers that shouldn't be renamed, but
 the zodiac docs do not explain which ones, so the renaming is a bit
 approximate. Perhaps there is one in this expansion that should not be
 renamed but is being renamed incorrectly.

State-Changed-Why:

After some discussion with Matthew, we figured that there are two problems
here. 

First, the macro definition is wrong. It duplicates a name without
indicating that the duplicate is not part of the original source. To fix
this, take a look at fluid-let. Probably you need to add in a "dup-symbol"
call in there.

Second, the documentation for zodiac needs to explain how to write proper
macros.
