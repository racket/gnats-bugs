>Description:
A let-macro with a given name, upon return, destroys the top-level
macro definition with the same name.  This comes up while running
macro.ss from the MzScheme test suite in DrJr, and this is _not_
one of the tests that is predicated upon the definition of 
'in-drscheme?.  This test file used to work, so either Zodiac
has changed, or the test suite has.

The following piece of code produces different results in the 
MrEd and MrEd no debugging language levels:
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-macro mx
  (lambda (x)
    (list x 1 8)))

(let-macro mx (lambda (x) (list x 6 7)) (mx +)) ; should be 13
(let-macro mx2 (lambda (x y) (list 'mx y)) (mx2 + -)) ; should be -7

 This should work, and used to.  It must be one of the casualties of
 the syntax house of cards.  I've spent a little time looking at the
 code and it's not clear to me where the problem is, yet.  Matthew, is
 it perhaps obvious to you?

 Well, it worked with the original houise of cards, but my inexcusably
 hurried, ugly, and sloppy "fix" for Patch 102-1 broke it.
 
 The problem is line 115 in x.ss:
 
           (unless stdname?
 
 should at least be
 
           (when (and (not stdname?)
 		     (vocabulary-record-namespace-based? vocab))
 
 Even better, of course, the code would be rearranged to something less
 opaque...
