State-Changed-Why:
I assume you want me to remove letcc.  It was put in because, way back
in the mists of time, someone put it into Rice Scheme.  (This is even
before I got here.)  I think Matthias used to use it in 311, and he
just snuck in and put it in the Rice Scheme definitions file.  I kept
it because some old code might still depend on it.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
Matthew, will you add it or should I remove it?  Note that there is
also a letec along these lines.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
Naturally, I prefer to remove it, along with `letec'. I'd prefer to get
rid of `catch' while we're at it. It doesn't make sense to have short
aliases in a cluttered namespace. (I've already ditched
`load-with-cd'.) I'm less inclined to get rid of `unit-with-signature'
since they seem long enough to be harmless (and, of course,
`call-with-current-continutation' is standard).

State-Changed-Why:
I have removed letcc, letec and catch.  I agree with your reasoning.
