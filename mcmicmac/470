>Description:
	In an unsigned compound-unit expression, zodiac allows
a "self-import" on an empty set of exported variables.
>How-To-Repeat:
	(compound-unit (import) (link (A (0 (A)))) (export))
        ; Should be a syntax error; instead, the error says
        ; that 0 is not a unit

Responsible-Changed-Why:
M3 problem.

State-Changed-Why:
We now disallow any imports of the form

  (link ... (<tag> (<unit-expr> ... (<tag>) ...)) ...)

because these don't have any use.  The above error is flagged through
this, rather than as a syntax error.

A corresponding error needs to be instituted for exports as well.

State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 10 14:13:52 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This turned out to be too restrictive, and is probably a bad idea if
units are to be an "assembly language" construct (since each client
must then take these restrictions into account).  Hence, instead, 

  (link ... (<tag> (<unit-expr> ... (<tag>) ...)) ...)

is no longer disallowed, and a narrower fix has been installed for the 
original bug report.  (In this case, it is reasonable for an import or 
export signature in unit/sig to be empty, which translates into this
case using the na"ive translation.)

exports will also remain unchanged in structure.
