>Description:
If I define a macro like that:
(define-macro my-when
  (lambda (test . body)
  `(if ,test (begin ,@body))))


and try to expand it using the DrScheme environment it is not expanded.

If I try the same just with mzscheme it works:

> (define-macro my-when
  (lambda (test . body)
  `(if ,test (begin ,@body))))
> (expand-defmacro '(my-when (< 1 2) "True")))
(#%if (< 1 2) (#%begin "True"))
> read: unexpected ')' at position 121 in STDIN
> (expand-defmacro '(my-when (< 1 2) "True"))
(#%if (< 1 2) (#%begin "True"))
>

Known problem.  There are two macro expanders involved.  We are
working on fixing up our syntax system.  This is documented somewhere
(probably under expand...), I don't recall where.
