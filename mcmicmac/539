 The bug here is that require-library is supported in mz, but not in dr. So, 
 I propose that we get rid of require-library.
 
 Probably we need to add this to the meeting agenda, for next time.

 While this is certainly an issue for a meeting, here's some food for
 thought until then: the problem is not that require-library is broken
 in DrScheme, but that DrScheme doesn't register the fact that it
 provides the library initially. In other words, because the
 definitions from "refer.ss" are already loaded, (require-library
 "refer.ss") should have no effect.
 
 (define (provide-library value . args)
   (parameterize ([require-library-use-compiled #f]
 		 [current-load (lambda (f) value)])
     (apply require-library args)))
