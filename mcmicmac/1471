 As I recall, the only reason we kept define-structure around was for
 Donkey.  Now Donkey is truly gone, since the Stepper is available.
 Should define-structure remain?  Matthias, should I ask the Indiana
 people whether they need it?

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: shriram
State-Changed-When: Tue May 30 14:54:24 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Both Indiana and Northeastern said they do not use define-structure.
I have therefore removed it from the language entirely.
