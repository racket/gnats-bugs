State-Changed-Why:

In M3's own testing area, user macros override definitions in
scheme-vocabulary.  In DrScheme (Jr), a separate layer is created atop
scheme-vocabulary for user macros, so that on each new execution that
layer can be re-created without having to re-generate the lower
layers.

The problem was that M3 was failing to use a "vocabulary mixin"
properly.  Therefore, it was using scheme-vocabulary to expand the
potential internal definitions.  In M3's test area, this is where the
user macro resides, so the expansion takes place as expected.  In
DrScheme, this expansion fails to notice the user macro (since it's
one layer up), so it expands m as an identifier and no internal
define's are seen; then the regular expansion resumes (in the complete
user's vocabulary), (m) expands to an internal define, and this is
flagged as an error.
