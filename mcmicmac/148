>Description:
	
I'm seeing keywords interfere with each other in check syntax.
I say interfere because I have to nest one keyword inside another
to exhibit the bug.  A single keyword at top level is highlighted
correctly.

The letrec is unhighlighted here.

(let* ((x 2))
  (letrec ((y 4))
    y))

The first begin is highlighted, but the second one is not.

(cond
  (#f   (begin 1 2 3))
  (else (begin 1 2 3)))

I should add, in this second example, it's not just begin.
Any keyword after the else (if, let, ...) is unhighlighted.

 Also (for a slightly different reason) begin isn't highlighted here:
 
 			  (cond [else (begin 1)])
