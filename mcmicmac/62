 What does "cannot deal with" mean?  Do you mean it doesn't recognize
 it, or that it produces bizarre output?  If the latter, please provide
 a sample expression and tell us what to look at.

 It doesn't recognize it. Apparently (rec f ..) isn't syntax for anybody. I
 thought we had it in mzscheme.

 I get this 
 
   #(struct:zodiac-exn "improper lists are not allowed" #(struct:location 7 11
   226 "/leto1/local/lib/plt/mzscheme/collects/standard/macro.ss")
   #(struct:location 7 29 244
   "/leto1/local/lib/plt/mzscheme/collects/standard/macro.ss") static)
 
 when I eval (reference-library "macro.ss") in DrScheme. Any help greatly
 appreciated :)

 You must be at the wrong language level.  I used a high language level
 and it worked just fine for me.  Note that due to a flaw in the way
 the system currently works, you have to do the (reference-library ...)
 in the REP window, then Check Syntax the code.
 
 Robby and I hammered out some details of how to prevent these sorts of
 problems.  (There are really two problems here, as you can see.)  I
 don't know when we will have implemented the solution.  It will
 definitely be in DrScheme II.

 I was at either Advanced or R4RRS, whatever it is called. -- Matthias

 These are two different levels.  Advanced < Quasi-R4RS.  Improper
 lists are disallowed at Advanced, and allowed at Quasi-R4RS.  You
 were probably at the former, not the latter.
 
 In the new "split" version of M3, I actually have much more sensible
 names for the levels.  They will be available soon.  (I was actually
 done, but then we made a bunch of changes to the language and now I
 have to propagate all those changes from the current M3 to the new
 "split" version.)
