State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: shriram
State-Changed-When: Sat Jun  3 11:45:42 2000
State-Changed-Why:
I have fixed the problem: when Zodiac is asked to parse a body in a
context where multiple expressions are not allowed, it skips on all
the internal processing because it knows the language cannot possibly
allow internal definitions.  As a result, this now triggers a
"definition must be at the top level" error and signals precisely
the offending "internal" definition.  So
beginner/intermediate/advanced should no longer see this internal
error message.
