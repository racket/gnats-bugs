>Description:

	Define something like this: 

	(define irs
	  (unit/sig irs-sig
	    (import)
	    (include "irs.ss")))

	(define Aschedule
	  (unit/sig Asig
	    (import)
	    (include "a.ss")))

	Now suppose a.ss contains an identifier, e.g., show-lines, that is not
	imported and not defined. Then DrScheme high-lights the definition
	of irs, not Aschedule. 

>How-To-Repeat:
	see above

>Fix:
	I suspect it is a Zodiac source correlation problem.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
Probably is an M3 error.

State-Changed-When: Sun May 10 14:14:21 1998
State-Changed-Why:
I tried out the following setup:

foo:
  (define frobnicate 3)

bar:
  synectic

main program:
  (define A
    (unit/sig () (import) (include "foo")))
  (define B
    (unit/sig () (import) (include "bar")))

In DrScheme, this gives me

  /a/santa/aten/shriram/plt/plt/collects/zodiac/bar: 1.1-1.8: Unbound unit identifier synectic

which is the right error message.  Therefore, I can't reproduce this
error.  Unless you can give me a more specific example than in your
error report, I can't figure out what went wrong.

 I have compiled the directory ~matthias/Bug-Zodiac with three files: 
 
 zod.ss : the unit file
 foo.ss : refers to y, which is not bound by import
 goo.ss : just for fun
 
 Start drscheme zod.ss, execute. It will highlight the definition of gooU,
 which is correct, instead of fooU, which is buggy.
