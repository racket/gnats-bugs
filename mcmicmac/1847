>Description:
In lab today, I saw 4 students who threw in some superfluous
parentheses in a function definition,
and none of them could make sense of the error message:

  illegal application: first term in application is a function-bound identifier

I think the "function-bound identifier" is
too much verbiage.  I'd suggest:
"Illegal application: first term in application is not a function"
Not as correct, but clearer.
You could follow this new version with a parenthetical
"Functions can't be passed as arguments at beginner level",
though i don't know how much that buys.

That's pretty neat, to catch that error inside the define!

>How-To-Repeat:
; at beginner level:
(define (add-one x) (+ (x) 1))
