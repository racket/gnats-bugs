>Description:
	Start with:
	(recur foo ()
	  (foo))
	Rename foo to foobar, gives:
	(recur foobarbar ()
	  (foobar))

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
	Not sure if this can be fixed, but perhaps reword known bug about
alpha renaming to include this type of weirdness.

Responsible-Changed-By: shriram
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri Jul 11 15:41:09 1997
Responsible-Changed-Why:
Output from M3 has too many identifiers marked as source:source,
causing Check Syntax to duplicate its renaming (or something like
that).

State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended

State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 10 11:09:30 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Old bug.  Getting out of active queue for now.
