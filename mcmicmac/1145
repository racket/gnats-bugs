>Description:
check-syntax does not look inside uses of define-macro.
>How-To-Repeat:
enter the following program: 

(define-macro m (lambda (x) (x y)))

(lambda (x) (x y))

click on Check Syntax.

The 'x' and 'y' in the second procedure are highlighted as bound and 
unbound, respectively, but nothing is highlighted in the first expression.

 That's because check-syntax never SEES those expressions --
 define-macro's are turned into void's by M3.  If you want true
 multi-stage programming, you'd have to do a lot more work.

 I suggest to leave this alons. Here is how I run these things
 
 (define (m-transform x) ...)
 (define-macro m m-transform)
 
 ;; Tests: 
 (equal? (m-transform '(m ...)) '(....))
 
 (m (x y)) 
 
 Check syntax works across the macros that I tested it for.

 I don't think that fixing this pr requires multi-stage programming. That 
 appears to be entirely orthogonal (ie, multi-stage programming is a
 different semantics and we are only talking about highlighting the smearing
 semantics that drscheme already has)
 
 [I do not mean to implicitly disagree with Matthias in this message; I am
 ambivalent about his comments]
