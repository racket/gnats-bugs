 	add a (require-library ... ...) to a collects in 
 	your own directory; Spidey will say he can't find
 	it. 
 
 As far as I can tell, Spidey doesn't process require-library
 itself.  It looks like that's handled by Zodiac.  Therefore, I'd guess 
 that the problem is in the Spidey language in Zodiac.

 That's probably correct. But Spidey has its own version of Zodiac ... so
 could you please get it to do require-library properly ... -- Matthias

 The parsing of source text is done by Zodiac from the zodiac collection.

 Zodiac parses require-library correctly for programs. It evaluates
 properly. What are you saying? I am not getting it.

 Zodiac contains a distinct Spidey vocabulary, which is why it parses 
 things differently than DrScheme.  There are funny interactions
 with other vocabularies, which I don't understand.  This setup 
 is also responsible for the other bug you just filed.

 Aha. History: Cormac maintained this distinct Spidey vocab according to my
 knowledge. It is a "mixin class" that overrides some defaults in Shriram's
 standard vocabs. You will need to get together with Shriram to find out how
 to fix it. -- Matthias
