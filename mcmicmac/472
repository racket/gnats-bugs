>Description:
define-schema is mentioned in the language levels documentation.
Both beginner and Quasi-R4RS (and perhaps others) accept
(define-schema x 4)
and
(define-schema 1 2)

but x isn't defined as anything.

I can't find any documentation on define-schema
(besides the language level information).

If no one is using this, should it be dropped?
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-schema 1 2)

 Throw it out. It's no longer needed.
