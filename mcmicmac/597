 Matthew, do you have a problem with the change listed in this PR?  I
 don't mind removing the with-handlers entirely and letting the error
 percolate all the way to the top.  But I seem to recall you had an
 opinion on this some time ago.  Please respond either way.
 
 Thanks,
 'shriram

 At some point a few months ago, I changed zodiac to print the actual
 error text when it catches the error. I don't care whether zodiac
 catches the error and prints it or just lets it pass through. In other
 words, the change is fine with me.

 If zodiac catches and prints the error, some new mechanism needs to be put 
 n place to communicate with the repl and with eval
 
 1) that the error has already been printed,
 2) which exception this is, so that it can be raised/handled
 
 and in the case where it is handled, the printout needs to be retracted.

 Zodiac intends to leave the error completely uncaught.  Is that okay?

 That should work perfectly, for drscheme and drscheme-jr. At least, the 
 "-A" versions. For the released versions, it's no big deal, even if it 
 breaks them, since this is not the most common case, and I plan to release 
 today sometime.
