 Good point.  Since `or' is not meaningful in a language without `let', 
 I have made `or' (and `and', etc) only be available after the point
 where `let'/`local' enters the language.
 
 Let me know if that will cause a problem in the book.

 What? or is perfectly meaningful without let!

 Send me the macro and I'll implement it.  Thanks.

 (or a b) = ((lambda (x) (if x x b) a))
 
 where x is a gensym. 
 
 But, that might not work for other reasons, right?
 
 Perhaps "or" is not a macro in this language, but it clearly has nothing to
 do with let.

 Shriram, I don't understand how the language that you check and expand can
 have anything to do with the language that you expand into. For all I know
 the target could be JAVA. 
 
 Also, if we really assume that Beginner is that functional, then by golly 
 
 	(or A B) = (if A A B)
 
 Whether we loop twice or once doesn't matter. And the computations aren't
 intensive.

 It won't, and anyway, that pattern is called "let".  If you don't like
 the construct by that name, fine.  But I'm referring to the pattern.

 I agree that a correct "or" form in this language is not a macro. That
 doesn't mean we cannot support it, right?

 That can make linear time program exponential. It's not a good idea.

 That was my other alternative, but I don't like it.  It seems really
 strange that or should have two completely different meanings in
 different language levels (just like Matthew's argument about
 numbers).  Furthermore, this assumes there really are no effects.  But
 if the students use `or' to chain together open-viewports or
 draw-lines or whatever (as I believe HtDP does), then the effect will
 become very "visible".

 I don't think we will get far doing this by email.  I'll explain this
 in person next time you're in.

State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 12 14:06:06 1998
State-Changed-Why:
I have changed `or' to now expand as

  (or) => #f
  (or X) => X
  (or X Y ...) => (if X #t (or Y ...))

for the Beginner level.
