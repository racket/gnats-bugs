>Description:
This expression:

  (unit/sig () (import mred^) (void)) 

causes an error in the Graphical Full Scheme
language level:

  Unbound signature name: mred^

The expression does not cause an
error in the Graphical Full Scheme language
level without debugging. The former language
level's error is incorrect.

 Oops, this pr should be marked critical (I will fix that)
 
 Also, evaluating mred^ in the debug mred repl gives an internal syntax
 error (ie, the code that zodiac + aries produces is a syntax error in
 mzscheme (these should be the same problem, but both belong in the
 test suite, I'd say))
