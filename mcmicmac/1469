 These forms have never been in advanced.  Recent e-mail traffic (you 
 may not have seen) brought about a decision to add these to advanced 
 level, but it hasn't yet been done.  Like my use of the passive voice?

 This bug has already been fixed.  (I sent mail about it on Thursday to 
 Matthias.)  The test suite has been updated also.  Matthew, I haven't
 checked in the lot because I was out of town for a day and didn't want 
 to check in just before I left, in case something broke globally.
