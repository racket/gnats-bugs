I believe that this problem can be fixed once the origin etc. fields in
zodiac are specified, much like the source highlighting problem can be
fixed then.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

It's now defined: an identifier in an elaboration has a direct source
counterpart when the `who' field of its origin is 'source or 'reader.

This no longer obliterates the define-struct expression (in fact, the
arrows no longer appear at all). But, define-struct ids still cannot be
renamed, so this PR goes back to you until zodiac has that ability.
