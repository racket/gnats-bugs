Responsible-Changed-Why:
M3 error.

State-Changed-Why:
Problem was that check-unique-cu/s-exports was recurring over the
syntactic inputs rather than over the actual exported names.  (It
takes both as arguments so that if it finds a duplicate in the actual
exported names, it can use the syntactic inputs to flag that error
with an error location.)
