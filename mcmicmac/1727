>Description:
There is a need for a zodiac vocabulary that contains all
of the syntactic forms of advanced and those of full scheme. 
This vocabulary will be the one used in debug mode when the
"compatible with teaching languages" check box is checked in
the language dialog.

Shriram and I had talked about implementing it, but I didn't get
to it before returning to Houston and it is not clear that I
will have time to do it soon, so I am submitting this PR so that
it doesn't get forgotten.
