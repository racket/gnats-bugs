>Description:
define-struct exposes the structure mutators
              in languages without mutation.
              This affects the pretty-printer
              too, since one can create a
              circular structure and attempt
              to print it in a language that
              supposedly doesn't have mutation,
              leading to an infinite loop.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set language level to beginner/intermediate
    (define-struct foo (x))
    set-foo-x! is available to the user
