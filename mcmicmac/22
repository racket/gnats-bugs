>Environment:
	DrScheme 49/14
>Description:
 	(let loop ...) forms can introduce Arrows to Nowhere in
	Check Syntax.  MrSpidey reports "no parents" for the same
	variable.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Check this expression:
 	  (let loop () (loop))
 	Move the cursor over the second `loop'. Looks good.
 	Move the cursor over the first `loop'. The arrow goes nowhere.
