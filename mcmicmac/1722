>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
In either drscheme or drscheme jr, with language
set to advanced, evaluate either split, split*, or tprompt.
Instead of flagging a keyword error at the zodiac level,
they are passed thru to mzscheme where they generate a
mzscheme compiler error.

There is also the larger question of why these are in
drscheme jr at all, but that's proabably a separate
question.

 Sorry, I don't see these internal errors:
 
 Welcome to DrScheme Jr version 103.3, Copyright (c) 1995-2000 PLT
 Language: Advanced Student
 > (split 3)
 stdin: 1.1-1.10: reference to undefined identifier: splitfn
 ; split* complains about lack of split*fn
 > (tprompt 1 2)
 stdin: 2.1-2.14: lambda: malformed expression
 
 If I'm using the wrong test expressions, tell me, but I don't see how
 the sub-expressions above would make a difference.
 
 Since you're the one who picks the semantics of these constructs, it
 seems safest for you to specify what these should expand into.  I can
 massage these around a little as appropriate.  (In the case of
 tprompt, for instance, the problem is that we took out implicit begin
 in advanced.)  But I'm not sure what the internal error problem is.
 
 Thanks.

 DrScheme Jr doesn't flag "internal syntax errors" like drscheme does. 
 (BTW, when I said "evaluate x, y, z, I meant exactly that x, y, z, 
 not (x foo) or something. Just to be precise :)
 
 The point is that these macros expand into illegal syntax. In 
 DrScheme JR, these things should just be errors.
