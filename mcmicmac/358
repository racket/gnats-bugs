>Description:
	zodiac only highlights the last paren in the beginner level for
illegal function declarations, and the error message says:
"Procedure does not take any arguments"

Perhaps it should say: "All procedures must have at least one argument" and
it should highlight the name of the procedure as well as the parens around
it. 
>How-To-Repeat:
execute

(define (function) 1)

in beginner.

M3 issues.

State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 28 11:51:18 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Error message has been improved.  It was felt that this highlighting
was better than what used to be there, which is what is proposed.  I
would rather wait and see how students react to this than make changes
without feedback.
