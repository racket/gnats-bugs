	europa, drs 51
>Description:
	I was able to reconstruct the error that we were looking for
	yesterday afternoon
>How-To-Repeat:

	; foo.ss 
	(define x y)

	; goo.ss 
	(define y 2)

	; zod.ss
	(define gooU
	  (unit/sig (y)
	    (import)
	    (include "goo.ss")))

	(define fooU
	  (unit/sig (x)
	    (import)
	    (include "foo.ss")))

	; start drs zod.ss; click on EXECUTE; 
	DrS will highlight the rhs of gooU, and print 

	It prints this: 

	Welcome to DrScheme, version 51.
	Language: Quasi-R4RS.
	unit: used an unbound or non-primitive global in: y
	> 
	Also notice the word "in"                    ^^^^^
        which doesn't seem to make any sense here!

Responsible-Changed-When: Sat May 16 19:32:59 1998
Responsible-Changed-Why:
I'll take this for now.

State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: shriram
State-Changed-When: Sat May 16 19:37:29 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This may have been a problem in v51, but it sure isn't in -x.  I even
ran v51 and I got exactly the right (same) behavior.  Unless you can
show me an example that fails on v52, I'm going to close this.

State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed
State-Changed-By: shriram
State-Changed-When: Mon May 18 10:22:58 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Problem can't be repeated under v51 on CS, only on Matthias's home
machine.  Problem doesn't occur in current -x (v52/something).
Problem _should_ not occur, based on output of parser and expected
behavior.  Hence, problem closed.
