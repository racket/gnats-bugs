In the example below (in two different ways, see comment in source)
DrScheme reports "internal-syntax-error". This error occurs when the output
of Zodiac/Aries is not legal syntax in MzScheme. (This kind of thing can
lead to all kinds of subtle errors in the state of DrScheme)

 I am unable to reproduce the error. In the MzScheme Debug or MrEd Debug
 languages, I get:
 
  Unbound unit identifier eliminate-dups
 
 To get this error, I pasted the code in the PR into the definition
 window and clicked Execute. I tried on both my home machine and
 northamerica.cs.rice.edu.
 
 In the other languages, I get different messages (because units are not
 in the teaching languages), but never an internal error.
 
 Is the code in the PR the right example? Is there some special language
 setting I need to reproduce the error?

 I got the error message under windows, in the mred debug language
 level. It doesn't happen under macos, either. I thought that I copied
 the text correctly. I have no idea.

 Well, John was having the same problems I was, but he noticed a pattern
 where Zodiac would get into a bad state and then all (unit-based?) error
 messages would become internal-syntax-errors. Neither of us has been able to
 reproduce this problem on demand, but it may be related to some state Zodiac
 has.

 Ok - that makes sense. It'll be very hard to fix until we can find some
 code that triggers the problem, though.

 Yes, I agree. I will keep my eyes peeled.
