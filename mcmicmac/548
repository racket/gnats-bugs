>Description:
In the QR4RS vocabulary, DrScheme accepts
          (let* () (define x 10))
apparently as equivalent to
          (begin (define x 10))
But the let* form should be rejected. 

In contrast, DrScheme correctly rejects the following:
          (let () (define x 10))
          (letrec () (define x 10))

[I discovered this bug while refining the test suite to check changes
in MzScheme. The revised test suite has not yet been committed.]

Responsible-Changed-Why:
M3 shouldn't allow this.

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed.  let* was trying to prematurely "optimize" by by-passing let,
but the invariant was being maintained let-values.
