Responsible-Changed-Why:
I have a preliminary solution to this problem, but it has the
following flaw: say there is a core form L; say you define a macro for
L using define-macro; now say you remove user definitions using
(remove-user-macros).  After this, L is just unbound (ie, a top-level
identifier), not the old core form.  This is unacceptable to Robby
(reasonably so).  I am looking into how I can solve this efficiently
(an inefficient solution isn't too hard).

State-Changed-Why:
I believe this is no longer necessary.  Anyway, the solution given
above (in the Audit-Trail) has been fixed.
