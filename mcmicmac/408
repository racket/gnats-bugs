>Description:
reference-relative-library seems to always look in the mzlib
collection for libraries when parsed by MrSpidey. (It works
fine for evaluating code in DrScheme.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Run MrSpidey on this program:
 (reference-library "sigload.ss" "compiler")
 (define x 10)
; sigload.ss includes (r-r-l "sig.ss")

In contrast, this works ok:
 (reference-relative-library "cores.ss")
 (define x 10)
