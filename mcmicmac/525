>Description:
I tried to run DrScheme Jr under MrEd.  I figured that if it worked,
it would possibly give us a way of running the graphical portion of
the book with less memory demands than DrScheme has.  I tried the
following using MzScheme, and it seemed to give me a perfectly
usable DrScheme Jr repl:

  mzscheme -x -L drscheme-jr.ss foo -e '(go)' 

where `foo' is a local collection of mine which has the same code
as drscheme-jr.ss except it tosses out the dependencies on argv.

I tried to run something similar using MrEd.  I started it up 
without any flags, then executed

  (reference-library "drscheme-jr.ss" "foo")

It printed out the "Loading" message and returned with a prompt.
I entered

  (go)

This printed the welcome message and gave me a prompt, all inside an
i/o box.  The problem is, I can't seem to do anything with that box
any longer.  The cursor goes to watch, and I can't type either inside
the box or outside it.  Clicking in either region doesn't help.
Furthermore, MrEd no longer re-draws if I move back from a
different virtual window or iconize and un-iconize or any of those.
Even trying to close the application using the window manager's close
button doesn't work; I end up having to use `kill' instead.

 The problem is that DrScheme Jr creates a thread to perform the read,
 and then waits on a semaphore until the thread returns. MrEd is
 intentionally set up so that expressions are evaluated in the
 eventspace's handler thread. Thus, the semaphore-wait suspends
 all event handling in MrEd.
 
 In contrast, (thread go) works. Almost. If you use `display', MrEd
 writes
  stdin[123-134]:1.1-1.12
    global-defined-value: mred:debug:debug-on is not defined
 to sstderr and the refresh is off. If you evaluate an erroneous
 expression:
  exception #(struct:exn:variable "global-defined-value: mred:debug:debug-on is not defined" #<void> mred:debug:debug-on) raised by exception handler
 
 This is a great item to add to the MrEd test suite. Along the same
 lines, DrScheme Jr should work in DrScheme using just (go). And
 it doesn't. DrScheme Jr won't even load in Quasi-R4RS:
 
 > (define argv #())
 > (require-library "drscheme-jr.ss" "drscheme-jr")
 DrScheme Jr is loading. Please wait...

State-Changed-Why:
This particular bug has long since been fixed.  There are now other
problems which prevent DrSJr from running DrSJr, but those should be
separate PRs.
