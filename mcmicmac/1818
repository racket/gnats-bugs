>Description:
 
>How-To-Repeat:
there should not be an error when running this program,
but there is. The *second* occurrance of the signature
name results in an unbound signature error

(define exps
  (list '(require-library "invoke.ss")
        '(define-signature simple-mail^ (x))
        '(define simple-mail@ (unit/sig simple-mail^ (import) (define x 1)))
        '(define-values/invoke-unit/sig simple-mail^ simple-mail@)))

(require-library "invoke.ss" "zodiac")

(for-each
 (lambda (exp)
   (printf "expanding: ~s~n" exp)
   (zodiac:scheme-expand (zodiac:structurize-syntax exp (zodiac:make-zodiac 'who 1 1))))

 If it helps at all, when you execute this in drscheme, it all works 
 -- perhaps some internal table isn't being updated, but the fallback 
 to the namespace makes things work for evaluation. (Check Syntax 
 doesn't work properly)
