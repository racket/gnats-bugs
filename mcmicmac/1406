>Description:
When you press the button Check Syntax the
     tokens are coloured depending on their
     role in the given expression. The token
     DEFINE is not coloured when not at the global
     level, e.g. within a LAMBDA form.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f
  (lambda (x)
    (define g
      (lambda (x)
        (* 2 x)))
    (+ 2 (g x))))
; Press Check Syntax and see what happens to
; the clause (define g : define is not bolded.

State-Changed-Why:
This is because internal `define's get translated into letrec's
(roughly speaking).  This will probably require a major rewrite to
fix, and as such isn't of a very high priority right now.
