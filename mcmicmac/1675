The error message talks about an IF that is
supposed to have an else clause. Argh!

 I get a different message about begin-elaboration-time when I run 
 this, but as far as I can tell, that is the correct error message. 
 require-library is a part of the beginner language, but the source it 
 loads is not. That is why you get funny error messages. Too bad we 
 don't have unit/lang.

 Each of the if forms in the MysterX code
 is balanced, as far as I can see.
 
 Apparently, the error message comes from 
 functio.ss, which is loaded by an internal
 require-library.  
 
 Try 
 
     (require-library "functio.ss")
 
 and you'll see the error.
