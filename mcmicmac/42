DrScheme -x
>Description:
Evaluating this expression:
	(begin (list 1)
	 (let-values ([(a b) 8])
	   a))
Gives an appropriate error message:
 context (for local binding) expected 2 values, received 1 value: 8
But hilites the `(list 1)' expression instead of the 8. On the 
other hand, replace `8' with `(list 8)' and the correct expression
is hilighted.

>How-To-Repeat:
Eval the code above.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem is in collects/cogen/ariesu.ss.  The code generator does
not perform a `wrap' around forms like let-values form.  Matthew saw
the error when he changed 8 to (list 8) for purely accidental reasons:
the (list 8) was an application, which introduced a error-reporting
locus that could be used.  By coincidence, the locus was introduced at
the expression causing the error.

The fix is to insert the appropriate `wrap's in that file.  If Robby
doesn't do it (he currently has the file checked out), I will.
