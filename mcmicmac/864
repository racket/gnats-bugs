>Description:

    Here is a macro, followed by a function definition that refers to a
    global name introduced by the macro. Excute, then CheckSyntax. Now
    try to rename "line6c" to "foo". The entire expression (form ...)
    disappears. -- If you take out the function definition, everything 
    works. CheckSyntax and Zodiac are amazing, but we need them to work in
    the presence of macros. 

    (define-macro form 
      (lambda (name:sym msg:str exports:X . lines:listof:Y)
	`(define (,name:sym)
	   (let* ,lines:listof:Y ,exports:X))))

    (define (xecute1040) (ten40))

    (form ten40 "Welcome to Form 1040" line6d
      [line6b 1]
      [line6c 2]
      [line6d (+ line6b line6c)])

State-Changed-Why:
I fixed bugs in Check Syntax so that you can rename line6b and lin6c.
Can't make ten40 or line6d renameable, though.
