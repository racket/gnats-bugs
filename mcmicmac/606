>Description:
In beginner language, the input "#if" gives an error message saying
something like "#if is not a legal number" While this is true, it
is not helpful. Perhaps something like
"#if begins with #i but is not a valid number" or something like that?

Responsible-Changed-Why:
This is an M3 issue, though I don't see worrying about it in the near
future (at least until someone suggests this is a recurring problem).

State-Changed-Why:
Because of the way the code is structured, it would require
a non-trivial modification of the scanner to present an error of the
sort Robby wants.  As a compromise, the code now prints

  `#if' starts out like a number, but isn't one

Since we use #i at the beginning of HtDP, this comment is within the
grasp of students.  Suggestions for a better comment are welcome.
