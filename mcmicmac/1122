 You have to load "zsigs.ss" (also in the "zodiac" collection) before
 "sigs.ss". There's no good reason for this as far as I know.

 The sigs/zsigs distinction is a legacy dating back to the early days,
 when Mark developed sigs and I developed zsigs.  It has no good reason 
 for existing any longer.
