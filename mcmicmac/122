>Description:
	Add something like this to your file: 
	(define x (type: (listof sym)))
	(f x)
	Then execute gets stuck on the first line, because it doesn't know 
	about type: etc. 

>How-To-Repeat:
	
>Fix:
	I was suprised when I first saw that syntax for new typed
	primitives because I didn't understand how Zodiac could "parse
	away" the surrounding define. 

	For now, we could say that (type: ...) is replaced by (void)
	for execution.

Responsible-Changed-When: Sat May 24 11:20:13 1997
Responsible-Changed-Why:
McMicMac is responsible for providing the binding.

State-Changed-By: shriram
State-Changed-When: Sat May 24 11:20:37 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The binding has been provided.  As Matthias notes, the body expands
into (void).  (This was the subject of a protracted discussion
regarding how to deal with the reference* forms, but in the end it was
just too much effort to rewrite MzScheme and M3 to alow for multiple
values (which would have solved cases like this).)  Perhaps a saner mv
protocol would have been implementable, but not this one.
