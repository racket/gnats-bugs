>Description:

	Zodiac lets a compound-unit/sig expression export
a sub-unit name twice.
	
>How-To-Repeat:

Thes should produce syntax errors:

 (compound-unit/sig
   (import)
   (link [A : (a) ((unit/sig (a) (import) (define a 1)))]
	 [B : (b) ((unit/sig (b) (import) (define b 2)))])
   (export (unit A x) (unit B x)))

 (compound-unit/sig
   (import)
   (link [A : (a) ((unit/sig (a) (import) (define a 1)))]
	 [B : (b) ((unit/sig (b) (import) (define b 2)))])
   (export (unit A) (unit B A)))
