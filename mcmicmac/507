>Description:

Zodiac produces a strange result for the following program:
	
(compound-unit/sig (import)
  (link [compound-unit : () ((unit/sig () (import) 10))])
  (export))

[This is the essence of a real-life example. See DrScheme's export.ss.
 I re-named the compound-unit tag to compound-unit* to avoid this bug.]

Zodiac's output is roughly:

 (let-values
  (((g591:compound-unit)
    (#%make-unit-with-signature (unit (import) (export) '10) '() '#())))
  (begin
    (#%verify-linkage-signature-match
      'compound-unit/sig
      '(compound-unit)
      (#%list g591:compound-unit)
      '(#())
      '(()))
    (#%make-unit-with-signature
      (g591:compound-unit            ; <<<<<<<< !!!!!
        (import)
        (link (g591:compound-unit
                ((#%unit-with-signature-unit g591:compound-unit))))
        (export))
      '()
      '#())))

>How-To-Repeat:
	Load the above expression into DrScheme and get
an error message about "import" being undefined.

 [Added by Matthew: ]

Here's another one, also a real example from DrScheme: 

 (compound-unit/sig 
  (import)
  (link [export : () ((unit/sig () (import) 10))])
        ;^^^^^
  (export))

 Well, the tag is binding in the scope of compound-unit so it's not that
 surprising to see a strange result like that.

 Quoting Matthias Felleisen:

  1) Tags are not normal identifiers. They're in a different binding
     space.
 
  2) Even if you take the view thay they are identifiers, the leading 
     compound-unit/sig---to be expanded into compound-unit---is *not*
     in the scope of the tag. In the same way, (lambda lambda lambda)
     works because the first lambda is not in the scope of the second.
 
     In other words, we might argue whether
 
      (compound-unit/sig (import)
       (link [compound-unit/sig : () ((compund-unit/sig ...))])
       (export))
 
    make sense, but the following should certainly work:
 
     (compound-unit/sig (import)
      (link [compound-unit : () ((unit/sig () (import) 10))])
      (export))
 
    Besides, `compound-unit' appears nowhere in the expression
    except as a tag name!

 You're righ though my hunch is that some binding information messes up the
 expansion.  -- Several of my own test files look like this by the way,
 except that I don't choose the name compound-unit for a tag.
