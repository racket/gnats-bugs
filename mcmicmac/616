>Description:

when using include, zodiac seems to be synthesizing the directory for
include files based on the current directory, not based on the
current-load-relative-directory (or maybe it's getting that value at the
wrong time or something?)

 Okay, there was a problem that I fixed.  Here's the current code that
 sets the parameter.  Let me know if it looks right to you:
 
   (let-values (((base name dir?) (split-path raw-filename)))
     (let ((original-directory (current-load-relative-directory)))
       ...
 		    (parameterize ([current-load-relative-directory
 				     (if (string? base) 
 				       (if (complete-path? base)
 					 base
 					 (path->complete-path base
 					   (or original-directory 
 					     (current-directory))))
 				       original-directory)])
                         ...)))
 
 The one change I made from the previous version was on the last line,
 which changed from "(current-directory)" to "original-directory".

 Shriram, I have no clue if that is right. Check the pr and the manual and
 do the right thing.
