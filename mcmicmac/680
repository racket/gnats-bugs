>Description:
Given the following expression:

      (let ((define-values 5))
        (unit/sig () (import) (define define-values 16)))
                                       ^
zodiac produces an AST where ----------| is a lexical-varref
instead of a top-level-varref/binds.

State-Changed-Why:
M3 was invoking expand-expr on the identifier position (as per spec),
but this is clearly not quite right due to the above bug.  Instead,
the sym-micro in scm-core.ss had two key functionalities abstracted out:
ensure-not-macro/micro and process-top-level-resolution.  These are
now used in scm-unit.ss to create the appropriate structure.
