>Description:
The `time' syntactic form doesn't work in the Intermediate
or Advanced languages in DrScheme and DrScheme Jr.

The bug appears in DrScheme 101 and 100, but (strangely) not
DrScheme Jr 100 or 101.

Set language to Intermediate or Advanced
Evaluate (time 1)

 The problem appears to be that time expands into a let with an implicit begin, which is a no-no in intermediate and advanced. Also, there is a lambda with no arguments, which is also a problem. I added a begin, but couldn't see what to do about the lambd a. I didn't check any of this in.
 
 I suspect that there are other places where expansion might use an implicit begin in intermediate or advanced. Perhaps time to beef up the 'ole test suite?

 That explains the apparent descrepancy betwen DrScheme and DrScheme Jr
 in versions 100 and 101. Without noticing, I tried the old DrSchemes
 with Intermediate (because it's first on the menu), but then tried the
 old Jrs with Advanced (because it's easier to type). Since implicit
 `begin' was allowed by Advanced in 100 and 101, I didn't see the
 expected crash in Jr.
 
 With another test, I see that Jr 101 with Intermediate (instead of
 Advanced) has the bug.
