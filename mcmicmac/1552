>Description:
The program below should print the 
same result for the last two lines,
but it doesn't. Instead, the
call to the begin function is treated
as an actual begin so the '<html> is thrown
away.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; language: beginning student

(define (begin a aloa) 
  (cons a aloa))

(define (wrap a aloa z)
  (begin a (cons z aloa)))

(wrap '<html> empty '</html>)
(begin '<html> (cons '</html> empty))

;; OUTPUT:
Welcome to DrScheme, version 101.
Language: Beginning Student.
(cons '</html> empty)
(cons '<html> (cons '</html> empty))

This problem was fixed a few weeks ago.  A similar example is even in
the test suite!
