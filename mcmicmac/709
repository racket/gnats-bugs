>Description:
In the Beginner misued-quote syntax error message, DrScheme prints 
Scheme code as a value.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Beginner mode, evaluate:

 '(define (square x)
   (* x x))

The error message says:

 '(cons 'define (cons (cons 'square (cons 'x empty)) 
   (cons (cons '* (cons 'x (cons 'x empty))) empty)))
  is not a symbol

While that's true :), it doesn't give the programmer much
help in fixing the problem.

In general, the error message doesn't get the point across very
quickly. It seems that
  misue of quote: '1 is not a symbol
would be far more helpful than simply
  '1 is not a symbol
The latter is an equally true statement, but it doesn't tell
the Beginner why the non-symbolness of '1 is relevant.

 Also, the wrong format string is being used. It appears that"~e" is being
 used, but that should only be used for values, not to print
 syntax. Presumably we want to use a format string like:
 
    "'~a"
 
 so that the error message looks like the input syntax.

State-Changed-Why:

While the problem can't be fixed in general, I made things wrok
better likely cases. Some examples:

> '()
stdin: 1.1-1.4: misuse of quote: '() is not a symbol
> '1
stdin: 1.1-1.3: misuse of quote: '1 is not a symbol
> ''''a
stdin: 1.1-1.6: misuse of quote: ''''a is not a symbol
> '(a b 'c)
stdin: 1.1-1.10: misuse of quote: '(a b (quote c)) is not a symbol
> '(quote 10)       
stdin: 1.1-1.12: misuse of quote: ''10 is not a symbol

The last two examples illustrate the limits of the current solution,
but they are far less likely to be typed by a beginner than the first
three.
