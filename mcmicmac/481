>Description:
When evalutaing a define-macro expression fails, the exn:syntax
exception should be raised. Currently, DrScheme passes on
exceptions that are raised by the macro's implementation.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-macro x (lambda (x) 10))
(with-handlers ([void (lambda (x) x)]) (eval '(x)))
; => exn:application:arity, should be exn:syntax

Responsible-Changed-Why:

this won't be fixed in 51. I need to re-arrange the implementation of the
repl to fix this. This is the same sort of re-arrangement that pr 497
and the integration of drs jr and drscheme necessitate.

 I set this to you, since you seem to have the strongest opionion on the
 correct exceptions to raise. After mz is doing something you are happy
 with, dr will follow suit.
