>Description:
Local variables in classes should shadow imports.
However, when I set such a shadowed identifier, DrScheme complains

Mutating imported identifier

Vanilla MrEd doesn't.
    
    

>How-To-Repeat:
(define event-number-snip%
  (class* message-snip% (event-number-snip<%>) (event-number . args)
    (inherit set-message
	     set-min-width set-max-width)
    (public
     (set-event-number
      (lambda (number)
	(set-message number)
	(set! event-number number))))
    
Note that it has a local variable EVENT-NUMBER.  However, there's also an
import called EVENT-NUMBER, and DrScheme produces above error.

 This appears to be a zodiac bug. This program:
 
 (unit/sig ()
    (import (event-number))
 
    (define event-number-snip%
    (class* object% () (event-number)
      (public
       (set-event-number
        (lambda (number)
 	(set! event-number number)))))))
 
 has no errors in mzscheme without debugging, but gives an incorrect 
 syntax error in mzscheme with debugging. (seems like a good one for 
 the ole test suite)

 To cover such cases, I've added a few tests to the MzScheme test suite.
 (DrScheme correctly signals a syntax error for the third test.)
 
 (test #t unit? (unit 
 		 (import x)
 		 (export)
 		 (let ([x 10])
 		   (set! x 5))))
 (test #t unit? (unit 
 		 (import x)
 		 (export)
 		 (class object% ()
 		   (public
 		     [x 10])
 		   (sequence
 		     (set! x 5)))))
 (syntax-test '(let ([x 10])
 		(unit 
 		  (import x)
 		  (export)
 		  (set! x 5))))

Zodiac bug.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jun  2 16:43:47 2000
State-Changed-Why:
The code in scm-unit.ss was checking the unit binding attributes
rather than the environment.  Added unit-binding to scm-unit as a
sub-type of lexical-binding, thereby preserving the interface but
allowing Zodiac to distinguish between unit-bound and lexically-bound
identifiers.  Zodiac now does the right thing on the test cases.
