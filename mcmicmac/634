 This error message is wrong. It should not say "'empty" it should say
 "empty". Also, why is that error message different than the one above?
 
 > 	Now eval (define (f x) (empty x)). That's just fine!!!
 
 I believe that this one (according to our current definition) should be
 fine. "empty" is an identifier which is legal in the application
 position. When f is applied, an error is raised.

 Matthias: please CC your responses to plt-gnats.  Otherwise we lose
 track of conversation, and the followups make no sense (especially if
 you return to read them a few weeks or months later).  Thanks.
 
 Let me explain the three responses:
 
 > 	Eval (define (f x) (100 x)). Correct error report. 
 
 M3 is checking to make sure that the first position after the
 parenthesis is syntactically an identifier.
 
 > 	Eval (define (f x) ('() x)). Error message: 'empty not a function 
 
 The reason this produces a different response than the one above is
 because of the order of parsing.  M3 first parses the sub-expressions,
 then checks whether the first one parsed to a top-level varref.  Since
 ' must be followed by a symbol, you get an error from the first stage.
 (Btw, the error I get is that 'empty is not a SYMBOL, rather than what
 you typed in the error report.  If you're getting something different,
 there's a serious problem somewhere!)
 
 > 	Now eval (define (f x) (empty x)). That's just fine!!!
 
 That's because our only syntactic rule is that the fist position be a
 symbol.  `empty' is bound by the run-time system.  If you wish, we
 could deploy a parameter to keep track of the symbolic constants and
 eliminate that from the list of symbols.  Robby, wouldn't you be the
 one who provides the value of this parameter?

 Currently, we allow:
 
 (define (f x) (empty 12))
 (define (empty x) 0)
 
 So, we'd have to change that, too....

 We're currently not really set up for symbolic constants.  I am
 hoping, however, that there's a single point of control (possible)
 through which I can identify and disallow such code.  If there is, it
 would be a happy happenstance.

 Let's watch and see. If the problem shows up, we follow up; if not, we drop
 the point. The goal is not to be correct; the goal is to provide pragmatic
 help. (Though with the ideal Zodiac/M17 we wouldn't have any problem
 setting up our grammars and tools correctly.)

 I understand the "wait and see" now. How about you send an email to
 everyone who was involved with the workshop and ask whether they 
 saw the following problems
 
 	* ( '()   10 )
 	* ( empty 10 )
 
 Thanks.
