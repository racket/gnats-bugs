Bug fixed.

Responsible-Changed-When: Fri May 16 01:41:17 1997
Responsible-Changed-Why:
This was a bug in M3.  There was some very hairy code for handling the
`quote' case which seemed needlessly complex.  Unable to figure out
why it was there, I "simplified" it.  Well, now I know why it was the
way it was.

Code reinstated, bug gone.
