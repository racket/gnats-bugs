>Description:
The following TR code fails:

#lang typed/racket

(struct: point ([x : Number] [y : Number]))
(provide (struct-out point))

with this error:
 module: identifier already provided (as a different binding) in: point

In addition, trying to step through this in the macro stepper fails. Steps:
* run macro stepper on above code (macro hiding off)
* step to end
* step back

The following error is produced:

in-list: expected argument of type <list>; given #<void>

 The Typed Racket bug is a duplicate of a previously reported bug,
 which I'm about to fix.
 
 I'm assigning this to Ryan for the macro stepper part, but please
 report two separate bugs in the future.
