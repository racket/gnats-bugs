>Description:
For some reason the Macro Stepper does not show syntax properties whose keys are uninterned symbols.  To view this behavior, see the output of "macro" in the program below (step 63 of 67 with macro hiding disabled); select the result expression and click the "Syntax Object" tab in the macro stepper.  It shows properties "origin" and "interned", but nothing about the uninterned symbol.

 I think that's because that's how syntax-property-symbol-keys works.

 I think the properties are more of a security issue; maybe we need to
 involve inspectors or something.

 I see.  Well, the macro stepper shows stuff that I don't believe one
 can normally get at -- like lists of individual marks -- so hopefully
 Ryan can make it show more properties, as well.
