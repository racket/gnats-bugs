>Description:
The macro stepper (with standard macro hiding enabled) does not fully expand macros which are "recursive" (i.e. macros which refer to themselves in their own expansions). The stepper only applies the macro transformation once, and does not continue to expand the result.

When macro hiding is disabled, there is no problem.

When the program is run, there is no problem: the program produces the expected output.

When the macro is expanded using the racket "expand" procedure, there is no problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following into the Dr. Racket definitions area:

#lang racket

(define-syntax foo
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((foo a) 1)
    ((foo a stuff ...) (+ 1 (foo stuff ...)))))

(foo a b c d e)

Press the "Macro Stepper" button, ensure that macro hiding is set to "Standard", and then press the "End" button to skip to the final expansion. You can see that (foo a b c d e) is expanded to (+ 1 (foo b c d e)), rather than the expected (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 1)))). Note however that when the program is run, the output is still 5 as expected. Further, note that typing (expand '(foo a b c d e)) in the REPL gives: '(#%app + '1 (#%app + '1 (#%app + '1 (#%app + '1 '1)))).

Reason>>> macro stepper bug -- these are still yours, right?
