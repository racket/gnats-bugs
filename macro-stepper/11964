>Description:
Using the macro stepper repeatedly means lots of separate windows get opened.  The user has to close each one or pollute their screen with extra windows.  This is only occasionally useful for comparing different runs; in the common case I want the old windows to go away or be reused.

Thanks, Ryan!
