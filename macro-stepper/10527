 I haven't been able to reproduce this bug. Did it only show up if you  
 used certain macro hiding policies? (If so, which?) Or does it depend  
 on code that isn't checked in?

 I'm not seeing it now, either. I did fix a bug in the code that was
 being stepped, and you'd probably have to go back to the buggy
 version, which is kind of a depressing thought, because it means you'd
 have to wade thru some pretty big expansions .... but I'm guessing
 that if you checked out the SVN version on the day before I sent in
 the PR you'd see the message.
 
 And I think I saw it with multiple different macro hiding policies
 (and, fwiw, I only ever checked and unchecked checkboxes; I didn't
 fill in any more info).
 
 Sorry,
 Robby
