>Description:
Right-clicking is still a click, so it's supposed to work on whatever you
clicked on.  But in the macro stepper it looks like the right-click is
handled by the whole window which makes interacting with it very confusing.
For example, click one identifier, then right-click another and choose to
show it -- and that will apply to the first one.  I'd expect it to behave
more as if I clicked there first.  (And the "handled by the whole window"
bit is evident since right clicking works the same when clicking on some
empty space.)

As a quick hack to improve just that part, it would help if the "show/hide
selected identifier" would instead name the identifier they'll be using.
