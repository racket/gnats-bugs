>Description:
I would like to double click on an identifier in the macro stepper to change its hiding policy. If its currently hidden then clicking should show it and if its shown then it should be hidden.

This is as opposed to right clicking and selecting 'hide' or 'show' from the popup menu.

 Kind of unrelated, but its also not always obvious if a macro is being
 shown. If I show a lot of macros in the hiding policy box then I can
 easily forget if a given identifier is shown or not. Can some extra
 notification for the highlighted identifier be added somewhere?
