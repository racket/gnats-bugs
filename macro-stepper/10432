>Description:
I opened web-server/default-web-root/htdocs/lang-servlets/add02.ss and pressed 'Macro Stepper' I get a bunch of stderr printouts in the REPL that say:

out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!out of lifts!

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "ryanc" by ryanc at Mon, 07 Sep 2009 18:16:18 -0400
Reason>>> macro stepper

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by ryanc at Mon, 07 Sep 2009 18:16:18 -0400
Reason>>> Problem with reporting different kinds of lifts.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by ryanc at Thu, 01 Jul 2010 14:11:30 -0400
Reason>>> I seem to have found the missing lifts. At least, I no
longer get the printouts.
