>Description:
Sometimes I cannot scroll in the window of the macro stepper. This does not happen for all programs.
Greetings, Jos
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following program in the definitions window, press 'macro stepper', disable macro hiding, press 'end' and try to scroll. (The program is after a very reveiling tutorial of Eli Barzilay)

#lang racket

(require (lib "stxparam.ss" "mzlib"))

(define-syntax-parameter it
 (lambda (stx)
  (raise-syntax-error #f "can only be used inside ifit" stx)))

(define-syntax ifit
 (syntax-rules ()
  ((_ test then else)
   (let ([t test])
    (syntax-parameterize ((it (make-rename-transformer #'t)))
     (if t then else))))))

(ifit 1 2 3) ; 2
(ifit 4 it 5); 4
(ifit #f 6 (not it)) ; #t
(let ((it 7)) (ifit #t it 8)) ; 7
(let ((it 9)) (ifit #f 10 it)) ; 9
; the end

 I'm unable to reproduce the problem with a recent build on a Linux 
 system. I noticed that the bug report was submitted on Windows, and 
 there was a Windows-only GUI toolkit bug that affected the macro stepper 
 that was recently fixed. Could you try a recent build and see if the 
 problem still exists? Here's a link to the latest release candidate:
