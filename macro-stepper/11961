>Description:
The program below produces 3 steps in the macro stepper with "Standard" macro hiding.  Step 1 shows (err) transitioning to (fail); (fail) has one mark from this expansion step.  Step 2 shows (fail) raising a syntax error; (fail) has two marks here [the previous one plus one other].  Step 3 repeats the error message.

I don't know where the extra mark comes from between steps 1 and 2, but I assume it is an error in the stepper output.

[The (err) macro and step 1 above are not strictly necessary to exhibit an extra mark.  I include them to force the macro stepper to show the initial version of (fail) without the extra mark.]
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(define-syntax (fail stx)
  (raise-syntax-error #f "Failure!" stx))
(define-syntax-rule (err) (fail))
(err)

Reason>>> The error is raised by the 'fail' macro transformer; that's
where the mark comes from. Attempting to unwind the mark
(not always possible!) does not seem worth the trouble in
this case.
