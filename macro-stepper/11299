I start DrRacket, load a program, and run the Macro Stepper.  I close the DrRacket window (File | Close).  Then I kill the Macro Stepper window.  Now there are no DrRacket windows anywhere on screen.  But when I click on DrRacket in the Quick Start bar in Windows 7, nothing happens.  This is because there is a DrRacket process still running.  However, there are no windows visible, and it's not clear what one can do to get back to DrRacket.  I had to use the Task Manager to kill the process and re-start it.

At the very least, I'd say it's a funny interaction with Windows 7.  The last guy to leave isn't turning out the lights, but nobody else can come into the room, either.

 Looks like the problem is that syntax-browser-frame% needs to be
 derived from frame:basic%, not frame% (but I just took a quick look at
 the code).

 That's the wrong class (it's for standalone syntax browsers, rarely 
 used). The frame class used by the DrScheme tool version of the macro 
 stepper does extend frame:basic%. The code is in 
 macro-debugger/tool.rkt. The frame is created in a separate eventspace, 
 though; perhaps that causes the problem.

 The eventspace shouldn't matter.

 Is it possible you're creating the macro stepper window in the wrong
 namespace? The "should we shutdown the process" predicate depends on
 top-level state in one of the framework modules.

 PS: all bets are off when you mix state like that. I'm not sure how to
 make a contract violation out of that, but I would if I could.

 Do you mean 'internal-get-the-frame-group'? It doesn't rely on any 
 namespace functions, so the value of current-namespace shouldn't matter 
 (it's just an ordinary variable reference). In fact, I don't see any 
 namespace code at all in framework/private/{frame,group}.rkt.

 Yes, that's right.
 
 I'm saying that if you create a frame where you're not using the same
 instantiation of the framework modules as drracket, then things won't
 work. The code seems to be using an instantiation of the framework
 modules from the user's program, not from drracket's.
