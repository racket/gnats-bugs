>Description:
When I press the "Macro Stepper" button in a medium-sized Scribble document, I get the following error message:

sequence-contract-violation: negative: method set-max-width cannot be called, except in states (unlocked write-lock), args 1359
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem seems to show up non-deterministically, hence I cannot provide a minimal test case.

The offending scribble document uses the scribble/eval part a lot, maybe this has something to do with the error.
>Fix:
