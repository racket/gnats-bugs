>How-To-Repeat:
Opened the macro stepper for the module in the description and set macro hiding to disable. Stepped in just past the define-type expansion. <...>. Back in the interactions with the macro stepper still open, typed the expression (parse '{+ { - 3 4} 7}) and saw the internal error when enter was pressed. The <...> above was a sequence of steps with another window which I don't recall specifics, mostly browsing another version of the module code above. There was also an overnight gap at that point, but it is probably not significant.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by ryanc at Thu, 03 Mar 2011 17:54:59 -0500
Reason>>> I believe this was fixed a few weeks ago.
