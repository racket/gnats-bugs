>Description:
I am using the macro stepper on a small
lang/htdp-beginner program. See below. 
When I go back to drscheme only the STOP 
button is enabled, all others are disabled. 

If I remove the big-bang line, this doesn't happen. 
Furthermore, if I click on STOP long enough I get 
drscheme's repl prompt to reappear with an error message
pointing to my 'extract last value from world' method. 

(Just in case it isn't clear, the program is an infinite 
loop.)
>How-To-Repeat:
(module foo lang/htdp-beginner 
  (require 2htdp/universe)
  (define (f x) 1)  
  (big-bang 0 (on-tick f)))

doesn't seem to be a problem as long as the user is aware
that the code is run.

 A stepper should never run code w/o ado. Just imagine, the program  
 could eat up a lot of resources and since I can't see that drscheme  
 is running (it's hidden) the machine may become extremely  
 unresponsive before I know it.
