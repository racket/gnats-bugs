>Description:
When I use the macro stepper with code in my class's language, it doesn't show the
expansion of macros.  The language is based on `typed/racket', but does a bunch of
things that might get in the way, so it might be my bug (possibly in my
`#%module-begin') -- but the strange thing is that I can't even see the macro when
I try to explicitly show it.

To try the code, install http://pl.barzilay.org/pl.plt -- it fails as is, and works
if the language is changed to `typed/racket'.
>How-To-Repeat:
