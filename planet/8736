>Description:
The directions specify testing the created .plt file locally (before uploading it) by using "planet --file ..." and then "(require (planet (<owner name> <.plt file name without path> <major version> <minor version>)))"

However, this "require" statement isn't recognized: it says I need an extra string before "(<owner name>".

No documentation for the "(require (planet ..." form anywhere explains what each of the string parameters is supposed to be.  I've tried several permutations of the filename with .plt, the filename without .plt, and the owner name, and "require" always says "PLaneT could not find the requested package."

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "jacobm" by jacobm at Mon, 11 Jun 2007 12:58:41 -0400
Reason>>> planet

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jacobm at Mon, 11 Jun 2007 12:58:41 -0400
Reason>>> This was a particularly unfortunate typo in the docs (which
I've fixed in SVN). The correct form is:

  (require (planet <.ss file in your package> (<owner name>
<.plt file name without path> <maj> <min>)))

I had neglected the <.ss file in your package> bit:
immediately after the keyword "planet", you have to put the
name of the file within your package that you actually want
to require. So

  (require (planet ("jacobm" "package.plt" 1 0)))

is a syntax error; it has to be

  (require (planet "file.ss" ("jacobm" "package.plt" 1 0)))

instead.

 This looks like a small doc bug.  I'm not going to fix it because I'm  
 not sure exactly what it should be, but if you look through the  
 doc.txt file, you'll find lots of legal examples, e.g.:
 
 (require (planet "test-connection.ss" ("planet" "test-connection.plt"  
 1 0)))
 
 ... so it looks like this part of the docs is missing a pair of parens.
 
 You can also see lots of legal examples by visiting
 
 http://planet.plt-scheme.org
 
 and clicking on the various packages.
 
 Anyhow; this doesn't fix the doc bug, but hopefully it will allow you  
 to make progress with your current task.

 I think that the idea here is that anyone who wants to use a planet  
 package will be copying this string from the package documentation,  
 so there's no point in explaining the various pieces.

 And anybody who wants to WRITE a planet package should already know  
 what they are? :-)
 
 
 Speaking of PLaneT, is there any way to delete a package, or does one  
 just mark it as "obsolete"?

 Ah, I see why you think this is problem now, I hadn't been thinking
 about the teaching languages, and actually I didn't even know that
 documentation existed until just now (I didn't write it). I buy John's
 reasoning, though, that since you can't _author_ planet packages in
 the teaching languages, you'll probably only interact with PLaneT via
 cut-and-paste so it's not too big of a deal if the docs are terse.
 Still, I'd rather if the documentation said something terse rather
 than nothing at all.
 
 Note that the explanation of all those fields does appear at the top
 of the PLaneT doc.txt file, along with some examples.

 You can delete a package by asking me, but in my view it's bad
 practice to delete packages unless there's an important reason why you
 can't just tell people not to use them. The planet versioning system
 ensures that people who just want "the best version" of a package will
 get it automatically,  but if somebody really wants to use an old,
 broken version for some reason I say let them have it. On the other
 hand, I have deleted packages off the server when they inadvertently
 released private information or when they were accidentally uploaded
 to the wrong account and then to the right one.
