>Description:
I guess required-core-version is currently checked only by the PLaneT server, not by the "planet" command-line tool, right?  I suggest that "planet fileinject" should also refuse to install a package with an incompatible required-core-version.
>How-To-Repeat:
I just created a .plt file (with planet 4.2.2) whose info.ss has required-core-version 4.2.2, and fileinjected it with planet 4.2.1.  It complained about an undefined identifier, but didn't complain about (much less halt in response to) the required-core-version.  Then I did a "(require (planet blah blah blah))" and it cheerfully read in the file, then complained about an undefined identifier.
