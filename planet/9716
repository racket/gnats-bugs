>Description:
Planet told me I was about to upload dracula.plt version 4.2, but it saved it as 5.1.  This was a side effect of the version 5.0 that was uploaded but not listed in either server.  Either the printed number or the actual number needs to be brought in sync with the other; I don't really care which since I can pick a specific version when I need to.

Also, I'm not sure I can edit metadata to restore a version I've removed from both repositories, since the edit metadata page doesn't show unlisted versions.
