>Description:
On http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=sml.plt&owner=chongkai
it says Docs [none], but I clearly have it:

http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/chongkai/sml.plt/1/4/planet-docs/ml/index.html
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The parsing of the info.ss file results for the scribblings field was too strict, throwing out the (valid) contents of the field Chongkai had put in there.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract error, nor was it a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 03 Nov 2009 13:22:37 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to svn and updated on the server.

Unfortunately, you'll have to resubmit your package, since
things went wrong during the insertion of the package into
the database.
