>Description:
I can't watch the ongoing activity of the planet installation log in DrScheme, because it scrolls to the top every time new output occurs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Require some not-already-installed planet package from DrScheme.
Once it starts installing, press the "Show Log" button.
Scroll to the bottom of the log.
Every time a new log message shows up, it will scroll back to the top.
>Fix:
The code was always recreating the entire log window when new entries come in. Now, it only updates the window when a new message comes (it does recreate it when switching tabs or opening and closing it).
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation nor a type error

 Thanks. That's fixed. Believe it or not, I was actually working on
 that on the bus in the morning before you sent in the bug report, but
 it took me a while to get back to it.
 
 It still isn't what I want -- I'd like to make it be the case that
 scrolling up a little bit causes the window to stay at that position,
 and scrolling to the end causes you to "stick" to the latest output
 and see things scrolling on up.
 
 But I don't know how to do that with mred. If someone remembers, maybe
 something we can do after Matthew finishes his rewrite? Matthew?
 
 Instead, it is now based on the position of the insertion point in the
 (locked) editor, which isn't quite right. But better. (I had to change
 the way the editor was updated to make that happen.)
