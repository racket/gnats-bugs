>Description:
This could be a PEBKAC, but I believe I've followed the directions carefully.  I've created my info.ss file, and the fields didn't seem to be read when I uploaded my .plt package to PLaneT.  In particular, I notice that it says "[none"] under the documentation column, and "-" under the version column, even though I specified both in my info.ss file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is my info.ss file:

#lang setup/infotab
(define name "LeftParen")
(define blurb '("LeftParen lets you make web apps quickly."))
(define release-notes '("This is the first release, and thus, expect it to be a, well, first release."))
(define primary-file "leftparen.scm")
(define version "0.1")
(define doc.txt "doc.txt")
(define categories '(devtools net))
>Fix:
