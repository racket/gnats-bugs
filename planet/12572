>Description:
An error message that says:

    cannot instantiate `racket/gui/base' a second time in the
same process

appears in my scribble documentation when installing my least-squares package through raco setup.


Howver, when scribbled directly through the 'scribble' utility, the document appears fine.  So something about the 'raco setup' context appears different and causes the scribbled documentation to mis-render.
>How-To-Repeat:
Observe that the documentation on PLaneT looks reasonable, with the graphical plot looking ok:

    http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/dyoo/least-squares.plt/1/3/planet-docs/manual/index.html


Now install the package locally:

    (require (planet dyoo/least-squares:1:3))

Once installed, look at the local documentation: the graphical plot should be missing, with the following error message in its place.

    cannot instantiate `racket/gui/base' a second time in the
same process

 Argh.  This might be a heisenbug or user error.  It was affecting my
 1.2 package.  Suddently, it's not showing up when I install my 1.3
 package.
