>Description:
The PLaneT collection docs contain the following paragraph, shortly after the BNF for a PLANET-REQUEST:

    When encountered, a planet-request is interpreted as requiring the
    given file name from the given logical package, specified by the
    client's host language (automatically deduced by the client), the
    package spec and the collection specification, if given. If no
    VER-SPEC is provided, the most recent version is assumed. If no
    owner-name/path ... clause is provided, the default package is
    assumed.

Say what?  Logical package?  Default package?  Host language?  (That latter does suggest some possible interpretations, but it'd still be nice to have an explanation of that.)

Plus, there are several things in the grammar that are left unspecified:
  * You've got a production for OWNER-NAME, but this symbol never
    occurs on the right-hand side of a production.  So, in
       (require (planet "environment.ss" 
                ("cobbe" "environment.plt" 1 0)))
    is "cobbe" just considered part of the path?
  * For that matter, why would one need to specify a FILE-PATH inside
    a PKG-SPEC in the first place?  Or are you leaving room for future
    expansion?

Reason>>> planet


State changed from "open" to "closed" by jacobm at Fri, 27 May 2005 12:06:18 -0400
Reason>>> As it turns out, all of that stuff referred to a very old
concept of how PLaneT worked that doesn't map very well onto
how it's being used now (and it was pretty badly written
anyway). I've rewritten that paragraph, mostly by throwing
away all the junk that you can't actually do with the
current implementation, and also altered the BNF to be
slightly simpler and use the OWNER-NAME production where it
should. Thanks for catching this.
