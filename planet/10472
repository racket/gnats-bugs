>Description:
The PLaneT require form is reporting 403 Forbidden errors when my machine attempts to connect to the PLaneT server.  This happens regardless of whether I use the new- or old-style planet require form, and regardless of the PLaneT package.

Currently I get this error:
;; ---
require: PLaneT could not download the requested package: Internal error (unknown HTTP response code 403) in: (...whatever planet package I attempt to download...)
;; ---

I've tried running planet requires...
* ...with multiple PLT Scheme versions on my own machine, with the same result.
* ...on a remote machine as well (which was running an old version, 299.400), and there I did not get this problem, although planet reports as missing some libraries which the website indicates should be available.  For example:
;; ---
> (require (planet "random.ss" ("cce" "fasttest.plt" 3 5)))
stdin::111: planet: Could not find package matching ("fasttest.plt" 3 (5 #f) ("cce")) in: (planet "random.ss" ("cce" "fasttest.plt" 3 5))
;; ---
>How-To-Repeat:
Download a PLaneT package.  I have tried these:
 * (require (planet jmj/annotated-snip:1:0/annotated-code-tool))
 * (require (planet cce/fasttest:3:5/random))
 * (require (planet "amb.scm" ("wmfarr" "amb.plt" 1 0)))

 Frustratingly, I'm not seeing this problem. I'm using a mac os x
 machine, as well, using a similar version to yours.
 
 Worse, I have some vague memory of this happening before, but I'm not
 sure what made it go away. Has anyone else seen this?

 Probably this is due to a version requirement mismatch.
