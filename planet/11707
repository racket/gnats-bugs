 Eric,
 
 The environment variable PLTADDONDIR controls where user-specific
 planet configuration and scribble documentation are stored.  If you
 run your different versions of Racket with PLTADDONDIR set to
 different locations, they will not share planet links.  I believe
 there is also a command-line option to set that directory, if that
 works better for you.

 I think this will work as a workaround, but it still seems to be an
 inconsistency between hard-links and actual planet packages with
 regards to different versions of racket.

 Yes, one might argue that it is an inconsistency, but since planet
 manages the downloads for you and you manage the development links
 yourself, it is hard to see how to make this consistent without also
 making it more confusing.
 
 Put another way: you might wish for this functionality for every file
 that racket (via raco make) compiles, so this is really bigger than
 planet.

 I think the difference is whether one views a development link as acting like a collection and the code is run from there, versus planet where the code is downloaded and copied to the planet cache. I want to be able to make local packages work like planet packages and are copied over into the planet cache, thus easily allowing support for multiple versions.

 This isn't really about compilation, though.  It's about the
 configuration of what is installed.  Eric is looking for the ability
 you claim he has: to manage the development links himself.  He
 currently lacks the power to assign different development links to
 different version of Racket, so since he can't do it and Racket
 doesn't do it, there is no way to resolve the conundrum.  The
 environment variable helps, but he has to write a command-line wrapper
 to set that variable when running each different version.
 
 If planet split up its development link info like it splits up its
 dowloaded package info, this wouldn't be an issue.  Multiple versions
 would not try to compile code from the same place unless the user
 explicitly told them to.

 I can see how it would make sense to specify a planet link as a
 directory where planet looks for version numbered sub-directories for
 the actual code. This would mean that different versions of racket
 would have completely different sets of code. Is that what you have in
 mind? Would you use this extra generality by actually having different
 code there?
 
 We could also go one step closer to the way the planet cache works and
 include version numbers of the code, too.

 I'm not yet convinced this isn't a .zo file issue. The original PR
 seems to be focused on compilation as the manifestation of the issue
 that motivates the request, for one. Also, it isn't clear to me that
 the extra generality that having different sets of source files (which
 would come along with different, version-specific directories) is
 desirable, except insofar as it helps with the compilation problem.
 
 Can you say more carefully why compilation is not the issue? That is,
 what benefits would you get as a planet developer besides avoiding the
 compilation problem?

 This para makes it sound like compilation is the issue.

 I wouldn't have different code for different versions of racket. I was imagining a folder in which I could put the source, and when racket version X tried to require that planet package it would copy it into its cache, and compile it there. Thus multiple versions of racket are supported through one folder of source files.
 
 Compilation is the root of the problem, so it could be solved with zo changes as well. But I view planet hard-links differently than code that I am currently writing. Planet hard-links feel like a library and so should work with any version of racket that can support the features it requires, while when developing a program I am fine using one version of racket.
 
 With regards to version numbers, I believe it already has that. I have had to enter version numbers when making the links.

 I don't know what Eric envisions, but here's what I propose as a solution:
 
 On my Mac, the compiled form of downloaded planet packages are stored
 by default in ~/Library/Racket/planet/300/5.0.2/cache (for version
 5.0.2, of course).  Each version of Racket looks in a different
 directory.  Development links, on the other hand, are stored in
 ~/Library/Racket/planet/300/HARD-LINKS.  Every version of Racket sees
 the same set of development links.  If I install a link for
 cce/my-package:1:0 at ~/my-package, each version of Racket will try to
 compile those files when running "raco setup" and will either clobber
 the compiled files from other Racket versions or report an error.
 
 If, on the other hand, we moved the HARD-LINKS file into
 ~/Library/Racket/planet/300/5.0.2/, then I could install a link for
 cce/my-package:1:0 at ~/my-package in version 5.0.2, and also link
 cce/my-package:1:0 to ~/my-old-package in version 5.0.1.  I would then
 be able to use the package in both versions of Racket, potentially
 simultaneously, without any clash over compiled files.  If I didn't
 install the second link, then 5.0.2 would use the code at ~/my-package
 and 5.0.1 would not have the development link at all, still avoiding
 any contention over compiling the code.
 
 It would also help to do the same for the "doc" subdirectory of
 ~/Library/Racket, so that Scribble documentation for planet packages
 in different versions of Racket would also not clash.
 
 This requires only a change in the default directories for storing
 configuration files generated by Planet and Scribble.  The compilation
 system itself would not need to be touched.  This essentially solves
 the same problem as the PLTADDONDIR environment variable, but without
 the need for the user to set up custom configuration to take advantage
 of it.

Planet hard-links feel like a library and so should work with any version of racket that can support the features it requires, while when developing a program I am fine using one version of racket.

I want to be able to make local packages work like planet packages and are copied over into the planet cache, thus easily allowing support for multiple versions.

 That sounds like a great idea to me. I've just pushed the change to
 try it out. Thanks.

 I didn't make this attempt because I was less sure of the
 ramifications. But I would not be against it if you wanted to push the
 change so we can try it out.

 Thanks, I'll take a look.

 My mistake, the "doc" directory is already under a version-specific
 parent directory.  I believe the problems here were from multiple
 versions of Scribble documents pointing to documentation from the same
 development links, which should now be solved.
