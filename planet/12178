>Description:
The documentation says

The 'can-be-loaded-with field: If present, the can-be-loaded-with field should be a quoted datum of one of the following forms:

  can-be-loaded-with	 	=	 	(quoteall)
 	 	|	 	(quotenone)
 	 	|	 	(list (quoteall-except)VER-SPEC ...)
 	 	|	 	(list (quoteonly)VER-SPEC ...)

I think those should be (quote all) or 'all, (quote none) or 'none, etc.
