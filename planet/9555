>Description:
When requiring a planet package in drscheme (from the module language
but probably in any language where debugging is turned on), the
package is retreived and compiled with errortrace on.  This explains
several recent complaints about long installation times for planet
packages, and it also leads to permission issues, since it also
attempts to recompile PLT files in errortrace mode.

I believe that the problem is not planet-specific, and probably a
bug in drscheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the module language, with the default settings, and a read-only
PLT tree, try to require a planet package.

 My understanding is that this is a known issue and that the planet
 resolver was supposed to be set up to deal with it, but perhaps that
 it broke recently...? In any case, I'm not sure that anything about
 drscheme has changed in this regard.
 
 Matthew did explain some of this to me, so I know the gist of what is
 going on, but not the specifics. Matthew, can you point me somewhere
 to get me started?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
