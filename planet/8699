>Description:
After uploading a package to the PlaneT server, you are directed to the add.ss page, where you can view all your packages.  It looks to me (disclaimer: I'm not a PLT Web guru) like this is not done with send/finish because re-loading the page there uploads another copy of the package!  I just uploaded two copies of plt-linalg.plt by mistakenly clicking on refresh.  Let me know if I'm mistaken in my impression that send/finish would fix this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Upload a package to PlaneT.  Wait to be re-directed to add.ss, click refresh.  Now there's another version of your package.
