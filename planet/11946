>Description:
In order to test whether an updated gzip.plt package I 
was giving to Jens Axel Søgaard was correct, I uploaded 
several versions to PLaneT, and I now find myself unable 
to hide them all.  In particular, unsetting the 4.x flag 
in the repositories subsection hid the most recent 
version (1.2) but not the prior one (1.1).  I then opened 
the metadata for 1.1, and saw that the 4.x box was 
already unchecked.  I checked and unchecked it, but to no 
avail.  It's still showing up on the main page, and I 
can't hide it.


Moreover, I think that this source code is not a part of 
the PLT tree, so I don't think I could fix this even if I 
wanted to. :(  Or is it :)

Also: in the process of testing the "steps to reproduce", 
I created a "testwoggle.plt" package... that I now cannot
hide.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a new .plt package with repositories = "4.x"
Upload it, creating version 1 0
Upload it again, creating version 1 1
Open metadata for 1 1
Uncheck "4.x" repository
Open metadata for 1 0
See all repos unchecked
Reload main page
See file still available!

 I just tried this and I noticed that the check boxes for the
 repositories are not initialized properly, but when I set them to hide
 or to not hide and then click "update package metadata" I can get
 packages to go away and come back.
 
 I was experimenting with my "big.plt" package. Is that one different
 in some interesting way?

 By clicking update between turning the checkbox on and off, I was able =
 to hide the most recent version of the package (1.1), but the same trick =
 doesn't seem to work for the older version (1.0). So now the 1.0 version =
 is the one that I'm unable to hide.
