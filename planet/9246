Hi,

The PLaneT repository (planet.plt-scheme.org) has been down for the last few days.  Does anyone have any idea when this will be up?  I need to use this to teach a course as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Takunari Miyazaki

 I'm sorry we don't have an uptime yet. I will be posting to the
 plt-scheme mailing list as soon as I can.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Hi ---
 
 unfortunately, an AC unit in the PLaneT server room failed and hasn't
 been fixed yet and the PLaneT server had to be taken offline until the
 AC is repaired. It's being worked on, but unfortunately the only ETA
 they've given me on when it would be back up has long since passed.
 
 In the meantime, are there particular packages you need? I may be able
 to work out a temporary solution for you.
