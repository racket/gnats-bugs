>Description:
Run or check syntax on a file returns the following inexplicable error message:

hash-table-put!: expects type <mutable hash-table> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: profile-point50 #<struct:prof-info>

If I run or check syntax again, DrScheme freezes and I'm forced to kill the process. Another similar bug (7086) mentions something about uncompiled .zo files. Within my Planet cache, there are no .zo files and other files from Planet have worked fine. 

>How-To-Repeat:
If you need the files, I can send them in. But there are several dependent files, so I won't include them here.

 Is it possible to reproduce the bug with a smaller set of files?  
 Perhaps in a single file?  The more work you can do to narrow the bug 
 down, the more likely it is to be fixed quickly.

 Are you running check syntax on a file that requires a planet file? How
 does planet play into this?

 Yes to your first question. I mentioned planet because the resolution
 to a similar sounding bug (7086) brings it up. I don't know if it
 planet plays a role, but it seemed like pertinent information to
 provide.
 
 I'll narrow my code down to a smaller test file and submit it.

 It looks like Planet isn't working right for me. The test case is so
 simple it must somehow be my fault.
 
 With a new, empty DrScheme window up: (w/ module language)
 
 1) In an empty interaction window, enter "(require (planet
 "random.scm" ("schematics" "random.plt" 1 1)))". I've tried 4 other
 plt files with the same results. In fact, I gave it an incorrect plt
 name and it (correctly) complained it couldn't find it, and still
 exhibited the same problems. Maybe something is wrong with the planet
 loader?
 
 2) Use the File->Open menu item (or New) to open any file and it
 raises a small "Standard Output" window with that "hash-table-get"
 message. The DrScheme window is unresponsive. I thought it had
 crashed, but I've now found the user break menu item. If I simply
 close this error window, Ctrl+. doesn't break DrScheme. Then I have to
 kill the process.
 
 3) If I break correctly, I'm back in the interaction window. Any other
 attempt to open a file sends me back to 2. Curiously, I can use the
 plt code in the interaction window.
 
 4) If I enter some simple module code, then hit check syntax or run
 I'm back to step 2. However, this time I also get a DrScheme Internal
 Error window. Now user break in the Standard Output window kills
 DrScheme. That's odd.
 
 I've tried clearing my planet cache and starting over, but it still
 fails. I haven't reinstalled DrScheme yet, since you might be able to
 gather more debug info from my setup. I can access library code just
 fine, only planet fails.
 
 This bug report is certainly verbose, but I hope it's also complete.
 Let me know what else I can test for you.
 
 Thanks,
 Pinku

 Thanks, Pinku. I'm not sure what is going on there. I have cc'd Jacob
 Matthews, and maybe he can tell us more.

 FYI: I installed DrScheme on a clean Windows machine and it works
 fine. Something is wrong with my setup, and a clean reinstall would
 probably fix it. But, as I said, I'll leave it for a little while so
 someone can figure out what's wrong for future reference.

 I suppose that anything is possible, but that error message seems to be
 unlikely to come from a problem with Windows itself. Possibly your
 preferences or a cache file somewhere is causing the problem.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "jacobm" by eli at Sat, 22 Jan 2005 02:20:23 -0500
Reason>>> I classified as planet for now, Jacob see if you can do 
something if not, then probably best to close.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by jacobm at Wed, 09 Feb 2005 10:13:33 -0500
Reason>>> The problem had to do with the interaction between PLaneT
and the test suite coverage tool. Fixed in CVS.
