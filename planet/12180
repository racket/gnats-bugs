>Description:
When you load a new PLaneT package, DrRacket shows a status line at
the bottom along with "Show Log".  Click on this to show the log.
When it's done, you can say "Hide Log" and then click on the X to make
the planet line go away.

Suppose, however, you forget to first hide the log, and click on the
X.  Now the line with the "Hide Log" button has disappeared, and there
appears to no longer be a way to hide that log.

(It's still there in the View menu, but it's not an intuitive place to
look.  I would suggest the button's in the wrong place to begin with:
it should be bound to the log, not to the planet line.  The top row of
the log has several tab buttons ("All", "fatal", etc), with lots of
space on the right.  Putting the Hide Log there would make it possible
to manipulate it independently.)

 I agree that would be nice. As I understand the docs, however, our GUI
 toolkit does not let me put anything there. Perhaps I'm
 misunderstanding htem or perhaps there is another way to do it, but
 I'm not seeing it now.

 In slightly more detail, I tried to make a tab-panel% object that had
 a 'no-border style so that I'd just not put anything directly into the
 panel, but put it in a sibling (vertically below). But I still see
 some black lines encircling nothingness. So maybe this is a bug in
 tab-panel% and this strategy should work?
 
 Here's an example:
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 600] [height 400]))
 (define logger-gui-tab-panel-parent (new horizontal-panel% [parent f]
 [stretchable-height #f]))
 (define logger-gui-tab-panel
   (new tab-panel%
        [choices (list "all" "fatal" "error" "warning" "info" "debug")]
        [parent logger-gui-tab-panel-parent]
        [stretchable-height #f]
        [style '(no-border)]
        [callback void]))
 (new button% [label "Hide"] [callback void] [parent
 logger-gui-tab-panel-parent])
 (define logger-gui-canvas (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor (new text%)]))
 (send f show #t)
