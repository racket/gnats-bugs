>Description:
I recently logged into planet.plt-scheme.org, clicked on
ralist.plt, clicked "Upload a new revision to version 1",
selected the new plt file, and uploaded.  Bringing this 
package to version 1.3.

An announcement went out on the mailing list:

(Here is where I would insert a URL if the archive extended
past 2005...)

The metadata shows 1.3 being the current version.

However, the top-level planet page shows 1.2 as the latest,
and requiring 1.3 fails.

(require (planet dvanhorn/ralist:1:3))

 I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to look into this until nextweek
 at the earliest. If you haven't heard anything and don't mind pinging
 me I would certainly appreciate the ping.
 
 Apologies,
 Robby

 I think it was just a matter of the "upload a new revision" not having a 
 repository selected by default (which I would consider a bug).  After 
 editing the metadata, the package shows up.
 
 There is a default selection if you go the "update this package" route.
 
 Thanks,
 David
