>Description:
Students using Racket 5.1.3 have been reporting that, during installation, the PLanet compilation process aborts. Installing Whalesong from PLaneT, under a sufficiently low memory limit, causes the PLaneT package to be half-installed.  Subsequently, the PLaneT package is "installed", but none of its bytecode is compiled, leading to unreasonably bad performance.

I had assumed that this was corrected by the time 5.1.3 rolled out, but it's still appears to be in effect.  I haven't tested under Racket 5.2 yet.
