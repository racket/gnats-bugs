>Description:
I get the following error when trying to run 'planet create' on a package with scribble documentation in scheme.scrbl.  The error message persists with suitable renaming if I change the filename and info.ss entry to manual.scrbl instead, so it's not that I've chosen a name that clashes with some internal structure.

Building: scheme.scrbl
PLaneT packager: Error generating scribble documentation: with-output-to-file: "/Users/cce/temp/scheme/planet-docs/scheme/" exists as a directory
Refusing to continue packaging.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to build a .plt file from a planet package with scribble documentation.  I can provide files if needed.
>Fix:
