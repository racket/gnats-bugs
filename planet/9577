mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
The planet frontpage has 3xx and 4.x versions; if you click on a package from the 4.x page that shows the correct 4.x version, it still goes to the 3xx version of the package-specific webpage.

Also, at some point we should set the planet page to default to 4.x.  Right now it defaults to 3xx, which is misleading to anyone with an updated PLT install.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to the planet page.  Hit the "4.x" link.  Then find "science.plt" by "williams" and click on "science.plt".  It goes to version 2.9; if you click on that page's "4.x" link it goes to 3.0.

 The default wasn't the problem I was reporting, though.  Now we just
 have this bug the other way around.  Now the 3xx index links to 4.x
 packages.

But given that this is a relatively underused part of planet
now, this seems like a low priority bug.
