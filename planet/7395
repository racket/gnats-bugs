>Description:
The PLaneT documentation indicates that the following is a valid PLANET-REQUEST:
    (planet "foo.ss" ("cobbe" "foo.plt"))
and further that this should require foo.ss from the latest available version of the package.  However:

Welcome to MzScheme version 299.106, Copyright (c) 2004-2005 PLT Scheme, Inc.
> (require (planet "foo.ss" ("cobbe" "foo.plt")))
stdin::9: require: Invalid PLaneT package specifier: ("cobbe" "foo.plt") in: (planet "foo.ss" ("cobbe" "foo.plt"))

In this particular application, I actually want to request the latest version of a particular package, so I'm asking that the implementation be changed to match the docs, not vice versa.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by jacobm at Fri, 27 May 2005 11:57:36 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed and exp-tagged. The PLaneT resolver now works the way
the docs say it does.
