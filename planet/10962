DrScheme 4.2.5, and Racket 5.0.0.1, still don't support the "new" (i.e. at least a year old) "require" syntax in student languages.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
recognizes
(require (planet sbloch/picturing-programs:2:1))
but BSL seems to want
(require (planet "sbloch" ("picturing-programs.ss" "main.ss" 2 1)))
or something like that (the Help Desk never says exactly what the three strings and two numbers are supposed to be).

Why should the student languages require you to do things in a more complex and error-prone way than the "professional" languages do?

 I am still not sure we want the full-fledged require.=20

 Perhaps not.  But if you're going to support PLaneT requires at all,  
 you might as well support the newer simplified syntax for them.
