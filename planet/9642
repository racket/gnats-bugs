>Description:
PLT Scheme documents two different formats for scribblings:
 MZC-section 9.1 (which PLaneT supports in lines 347-362 of planet/util.ss) requires a list of 2-element lists, the first element is the manual's filename string, the second is list of symbols (flags).

 Setup-PLT-section 1.1 indicates that scribblings is a list of up-to-4-element lists, the first is the manual's filename string, the second is a list of symbols (mode flags), the third is another list of a symbol and and optional number (category and sort-number), and the fourth is a name-string.

This incompatibility means that setup-plt scribblings are not acceptable to PLaneT.  Can this inconsistency be removed? 
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme

(define setup-plt-scribbles '(("manual.scrbl" (multi-page) (experimental))))

(define mzc-scribbles '(("manual.scrbl" (multi-page))))

;; uncomment the one you want to try
;(define scribble-files setup-plt-scribbles)
;(define scribble-files mzc-scribbles)


;; planet/util.ss @ 347
(for ([entry scribble-files])
     (match entry
       [`(,(? string? filename) (,(? symbol? flags) ...))
        ;; your code removed
        (display `(,filename ,flags))]
       [_ (error "malformed scribblings entry")]))
