>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
Since v299 is now case-sensitive by default, planet/config.ss is no longer in sync with the docs.  For example, the planet help-desk documentation describes the following parameters:
    planet-server-name
    planet-server-port
    planet-server-dir

However, planet/config.ss defines them as:
    PLANET-SERVER-NAME
    PLANET-SERVER-PORT
    PLANET-SERVER-DIR

(I don't care too much which case we standardize on, though I'd mildly prefer all-lowercase names.)
>How-To-Repeat:
At the DrScheme REPL, evaluate the following:

(require (lib "config.ss" "planet"))
(planet-server-name "localhost")  ;; to use an SSH tunnel through CCS's
                                  ;; draconic firewall.
planet-server-name will be unbound.
