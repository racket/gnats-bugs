>Description:
It'd be nice if the doc.txt files for PLaneT packages were automatically indexed (i.e., searchable) by the package name, in addition to whatever index terms the author includes.  This way, if I don't happen to remember what files are defined by Ryan's require.plt, I can just do a help-desk search on require.plt.

Currently, this doesn't work -- or rather, only works if the package author thought to add this keyword.  It'd be nice to have this for free.
