>Description:
It looks like "planet install" adds the new package's documentation to the user-specific documentation index (at $HOME/Library/PLT Scheme/3.99.0.23/doc/index.html on MacOS), but "planet remove" doesn't delete these entries, resulting in dead links.
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute "planet install plt typed-scheme.plt 3 4; planet remove plt typed-scheme.plt 3 4" at the prompt.  Open DrScheme and hit F1; you'll see two "Typed Scheme" links in the libraries section of the resulting web page.  One of them (the first of the two on my system) points to the now-deleted PLaneT installation; the second one points to the docs for the typed-scheme collection.
