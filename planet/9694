>Description:
I've been updating my "tiles" teachpack, testing that it works on various DrScheme versions, and uploading it to PLaneT, but some things that work fine locally don't work with the server.

(require (planet "install.ss" ("sbloch" "tiles.plt" 1 6)))

When I've "planet fileinject"-ed the .plt file locally, this works just fine.  When I clear the local cache, upload the exact same .plt file to the server, and "require" it from there, I get problems.

In DrScheme 4.0 and 4.0.1, I get the following error messages upon executing that "require":

include: read error (read: illegal use of ".")
setup-plt: error: during making for <planet>/sbloch/tiles.plt/1/6
setup-plt:   include: read error (read: illegal use of ".")

The software seems to install perfectly well, despite these error messages, but its documentation doesn't: when I search on a keyword in the installed teachpack, I get a match, but the match links to a nonexistent "doc" directory (which should be "planet-docs").

In DrScheme 4.0.2 and 4.1, I don't get the error messages, but the Help Desk still tries to send me to the nonexistent "doc" directory (of which, I should point out, there is no mention in the info.ss file).

Running "setup-plt" from the command line makes the problem go away, but I don't want my users (typically absolute-beginning programming students) to have to do that.  What's going on?

 Is it possible you saved a file when in a teaching language accidentally?

 As in, there's a confusion between #lang and (module...?
 
 I examined each of the .ss and .scrbl files in vi.  One of them  
 started with
 "; #lang mzscheme
 (module blah blah ..."
 which I thought might be confusing things, so I took that out.  Now  
 all those files start with "#lang", and there are no "(module"  
 declarations anywhere.
 Same problem: it works fine when injected locally, but points to the  
 wrong directory when uploaded to PLaneT (this is version 1.7 now) and  
 required from there.

 Something is definitely wrong here, but I'm not sure what.  When I
 install it (using the above line exactly -- 1.6), I get no errors, and
 the `doc' directory exists and has the right contents.  `planet-docs'
 should not be there, and it looks like you included it in the package
 by mistake.

 I didn't create "planet-docs"; "planet create" did that, so I don't  
 know of any way to create the package WITHOUT a "planet-docs"  
 subdirectory.  I tried creating a "doc" directory explicitly, and  
 symlinking "planet-docs" to it before typing "planet create", and it  
 dutifully filled "doc" with compiled Scribble docs... but when I  
 uploaded it to the server and required it, I got only a "planet-docs"  
 directory, no "doc" directory.
 
 Here's an interesting wrinkle: when I type
 (require (planet "install.ss" ("sbloch" "tiles.plt" 1 8)))
 in a Module language Interactions pane, there IS a "doc" directory,  
 as Eli reports, in addition to a "planet-docs" directory.
 
 But when I clear the cache and type the exact same thing in a  
 Beginning Student language Interactions pane, it finishes  
 considerably faster and there is no "doc" directory.
 
 So this has something to do with the difference between "require" in  
 Module and "require" in Beginning Student.

 To clarify:
 
  * `planet create' really does create "planet-docs". It's the
     documentation built in a particular way to be shown by the planet
     server (but it's built on the package owner's machine, so that the
     sever doesn't have to build docs).
 
  * The "planet-docs" directory sticks around when the planet package is
    installed, though perhaps it should be deleted from the archive
    somehow.
 
  * The "docs" directory should indeed get created when the planet
    package is installed.
 
 
 And as for the bug: the problem seems to be from two uses of `read'
 that assume a normal parameterization of the reader: setup/getinfo
 (which reads "info.ss" file) and setup/scribble (which reads ".sxref"
 files).
 
 In SVN, I've adjusted each of the calls to `read' to install a standard
 parameterization, but I don't see a good workaround for the released
 version, other than installing the package via a language other than
 the teaching languages.

 This doesn't sound good...  IIUC, for a case like Jay's tutorial, when
 you want to have some scheme files that are not compiled, you'd have
 to artificially add `planet-docs' to `compile-omit-paths'.  If that's
 the case, then I can make the new code implicitly omit "planet-docs"
 when it's in a planet development link (and possibly in all planet
 collection if it sticks around, but see below).

 What sounds like a proper solution to me is to have `doc' built and
 packaged by planet on the submitter machine, extracted on the server
 for on-line presentation, and finally removed from the server's copy.
 (Leaving the planet version of the docs in and distributing them just
 sounds completely wrong to me.)

 That's not intolerable; I can tell my students to switch to "Module"  
 language, type the "require", and then go back to "Beginning

 Yes, that sounds right to me too. I'm not sure why it was done the
 other way, but I'll put this on my (ever growing) list of planet
 things to look into.
