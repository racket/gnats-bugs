>Description:
Feature request:

Planet currently issues a very terse error message if two modules in the same program require different, mutually-exclusive versions of a planet package.  (Ex: I just ran into a case where one module required struct.plt v2.2, but another module required galore.plt 3.3, which itself requires struct.plt 2.1.  Boom.)

It'd be really really nice if this error message gave a little bit more information about what was going on.  In the case above, it reports "struct.plt", "2.2", and "2.1", but nothing else.  At a minimum, I'd like to know which modules are requiring these versions, to see where I should start looking to resolve the problem.

Longer term: I'd *really* love it if it showed me some representation of (part of) the require graph, so I could see the paths by which the incompatible versions are being required.  (I acknowledge that this could be tricky to do in a text interface.)  I had to flail around for a while before I found out who was requiring the old version and not allowing an update.

 One thought: perhaps PLaneT could have an internal mode to disable that
 check that could be coupled with the module browser, to help debug such
 things?
