>How-To-Repeat:
I'm running DrScheme version 4.2.1 (because some of my book users are).
In Module language, I type
(require (planet sbloch/tiles))
and it downloads version 1.14, even though 1.14 is marked with required-core-version 4.2.2.  Tiles 1.14 doesn't work in 4.2.1, as I already knew.

So I delete the PLaneT cache and my user library, re-start DrScheme, and type
(require (planet sbloch/tiles:1:13)
It says it's downloading version 1.13, but it's really version 1.14 (as one can see by looking at the PLaneT cache), and it still doesn't work.

I managed to get it to work by typing
(require (planet "install.ss" ("sbloch" "tiles.plt" 1 (= 13))))

 I'm having trouble reproducing this problem. When I use 4.2.1 I get
 version 1.13. That is, I see messages about 1.13 in the logs when it
 is downloaded, I see this:
 
 % ls ~/Library/PLT\ Scheme/planet/300/4.2.1/cache/sbloch/tiles.plt/1/
 13
 
 and this is the info.ss file in there, which looks like the right one to me:
 
 % cat ~/Library/PLT\
 Scheme/planet/300/4.2.1/cache/sbloch/tiles.plt/1/13/info.ss
 #lang setup/infotab
   (define name "tiles")
   (define categories '(media))
   (define can-be-loaded-with 'all)
   (define primary-file "tiles.ss")
   (define scribblings '(("functions.scrbl" ())))
   (define repositories '("4.x"))
   (define blurb
       `("The tiles collection provides functions for combining
 (vertical and horizontal concatenation) and manipulating (rotation,
 reflection) images."))
   (define required-core-version "4.0")
   (define release-notes '((p "Version 1.13: fix to maintain
 compatibility with DrScheme 4.2")
                           (p "Version 1.12: documentation typoes.")
 			  (p "Version 1.11: fixed some bugs having to do with zero-size images.")))

 Odd.  Now that I'm at my office, I'm getting version 1.13 too.  (It  
 doesn't work, but I knew that and I know how to fix it.)  I'll try  
 again when I get home.

 There may be some kind of state somewhere that's required to confuse
 the client. (I tried playing around with various things, but couldn't
 get any bad behavior.)
