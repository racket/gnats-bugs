>Description:
Scribbled planet documentation has broken links, both in the table of contents and in internal links.

The links work fine once the package is installed. The links on the navigation bar are also fine, but they're broken in the main document section.

This affects a lot of planet packages--try clicking on the table of contents or clicking on internal links to defined functions in:
http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/tov/affine-contracts.plt/2/2/planet-docs/manual/index.html
http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/dutchyn/aspectscheme.plt/1/0/planet-docs/manual/index.html
http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/dyoo/basic-blocks.plt/1/0/planet-docs/manual/index.html
http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/dyoo/browser-evaluate.plt/1/0/planet-docs/manual/index.html

In my example below, the link's href is "/#(part._testing-section-tag)" (note the leading slash) which sends you to your root folder /.

I can see why this is happening, but I can't see how to fix it. Take a look at `scribble/html-render.rkt` in the render-content method near line 1084:

    (define/override (render-content e part ri)
        ...
        [(and (link-element? e) (not (current-no-links)))
         (parameterize ([current-no-links #t])
           (let-values ([(dest ext?)
                         (resolve-get/ext? part ri (link-element-tag e))])
         ...


In planet packages, (dest-path dest) is a #<mobile-root> containing the output _folder_ of the planet package (in my case, #<path:planet-docs/test>).

Then, (dest->url dest) returns the incorrect href in line 383 of `collects/scribble/html-render.rkt` because it compares the folder to the current output _file_. If they don't match, (from-root) returns just "/" as the first part of the href.
>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce this issue for yourself,

1. Copy 'info.rkt' and 'test.scrbl' (included at the end of my message)
   into a fresh folder and make a planet development link.
2. Run `raco planet create .`
3. Open up planet-docs/index.html in a browser and click the "Try clicking me!" link.

;; info.rkt ------------
#lang setup/infotab
(define scribblings '(("test.scrbl" ())))
;; don't care
(define name "don't care")
(define blurb '("don't care"))
(define release-notes '((p "don't care")))
(define category 'misc)
(define primary-file "info.rkt")
(define repositories '("4.x"))

;; test.scrbl ----------------
#lang scribble/doc
@(require scribble/manual planet/scribble)
@title{Testing}
@section[#:tag "testing-section-tag"]{Some tag}
@seclink["testing-section-tag"]{Try clicking me!}
