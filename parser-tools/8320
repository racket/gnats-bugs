>Description:
Feature request:  currently, the (debug ...) form in parser-tools/yacc.ss signals a syntax error if its argument is not a string literal.  It'd be handy if I could use an arbitrary expression there that evaluates to a string.  In particular, that would make the following idiom possible:

  (define *PARSER-TABLE* "parser-table.txt")

  (when (file-exists? *PARSER-TABLE*)
    (delete-file *PARSER-TABLE*))

  (define p
    (parser
     (debug "parser-table.txt")
     ...))

Failing that, would it be possible to adjust the debug form to allow the user to specify that it's OK to overwrite any existing file with the same name?  The process of dealing with shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts is much more annoying because I have to remember to delete the stupid file manually each time I try to rebuild the grammar.

Note that I'm not suggesting that yacc.ss overwrite the file by default -- that's a bad idea.  I'm thinking something more like the error/replace/truncate/etc. flags that one can pass to open-output-file.

 So I just realized that the idiom I quoted in the original message won't
 work, of course.  This makes the first part of the bug report less
 important but the second part more important.
