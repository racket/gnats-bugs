>Description:
the docs for the parser function state that the syntax for the precedence declarations is:

  > (precs ((assoc token-name ...) ...)) OPTIONAL precedence
     declarations to resolve shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts
     as in YACC/BISON.  assoc must be one of left, right or nonassoc.
     States with multiple shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts or
     some combination thereof are not resolved with precedence.

that seems to be wrong and the syntax really is:

            (precs [left plus minus]
                   [left times divd])

so there is an extra set of parens in the current docs
