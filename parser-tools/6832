>Description:
If you type a comment like

#|| this is a comment ||#

the on-the-fly syntax highlighter colors it and 
subsequent lines red (syntax error) rather than 
brown (comment), though mz/dr treat it as a comment.

It also colors

#|# (define (f) 1) |# 1

incorrectly: mzscheme interprets this as a comment
followed by the value 1, but the highlighter treats
the #|# as a syntax error, the define expr as Scheme
code, and |# and 1 as syntax errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
