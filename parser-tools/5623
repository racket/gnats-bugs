>Description:
on a recent email from Philippe Meunier about a parsing exercise, he wrote:

There's a "9 shift/reduce conflicts" message that shows up, though. Do you have any idea where it comes from?  It probably prefers shift over reduce by default, so it probbly gets the expected result, but it might be a good idea to check where this comes from, just in case. Looking at the help desk there doesn't seem to be any way to have the parser tell you what it doesn't like in the grammar.  Maybe it might be a good idea to send a feature request / bug report about that.


>How-To-Repeat:
            (start n-start)
            (end eof)
            (precs [left plus minus]
                   [left times divd])
            (grammar (n-start [(n-line) $1])
                     (n-line [(n-expr n-line) (cons $1 $2)]
                             [() empty])
                     (n-expr [(n-expr plus n-expr) (make-op '+ $1 $3)]
                             [(n-expr minus n-expr) (make-op '- $1 $3)]
                             [(n-expr times n-expr) (make-op '* $1 $3)]
                             [(n-expr divd n-expr) (make-op '/ $1 $3)]
                             [(open-p n-expr close-p) $2]
                             ;; let {myvar; 1+2} 5+myvar = 5 1 2 + +
                             [(let open-b id semi n-expr close-b n-block)
                              (make-lst $3 $5 $7)]
                             [(n-expr semi) $1]
                             [(id) (make-var $1)]
                             [(number) $1])
                     (n-block [(open-b n-line close-b) $2]
                              [(n-expr) $1]))
>Fix:
The debug option to the parser-generator causes it to write
the LALR table to a file, similar to the -v command-line 
option to YACC.  This is mentioned in the docs.  The table indicates which items have conflicts on which grammar symbols.
