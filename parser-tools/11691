>Description:
The lexer in the steps pane creates a warning but runs just fine. Unfortunately, the warning goes to STDOUT every time I run it, which makes it difficult to diff my output with expected results. The docs don't mention a way to suppress the warning. It should be obvious why matching an empty string is acceptable here.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require parser-tools/lex)

(define (lex-newline-whitespace spaces)
    ((lexer
      [" " (lex-newline-whitespace (add1 spaces))]
      ["\t" (lex-newline-whitespace (- 8 (remainder spaces 8)))]
      ["" spaces])
     (current-input-port)))
