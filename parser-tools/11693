>Description:
There are two conventions that might specify which trigger fires when the triggers are ambiguous: cond-like order (the triggers are checked against the input from top to bottom) and longest-match. The test below indicates that the lexer finds the longest match, but it would be nice to be certain that it does indeed do so. I think this behavior should be documented.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require parser-tools/lex)

((lexer
  ["a" 'first]
  ["" 'shortest-and-not-first]
  ["ab" 'longest])
 (current-input-port))

<input: ab>
<output: 'longest>
