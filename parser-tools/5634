>Description:
It would be nice if the parser's suppress option took
an argument indicating how many shift/reduce warning
should be suppressed, and if it always warned about
reduce/reduce conflicts (or if it took a separate
numerical argument to suppress these).  That way a user
would still be informed of new conflicts when modifying
a grammar with already known conflicts (imho, a useful
feature of the yacc %expect option).
