>Description:
The --lhelp flag, when used, produces an internal error.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't have cut-and-paste, but here's the gist:

> x-drscheme-jr -- --lhelp 
gives an appropriate error message, but
> x-drscheme-jr -- --lhelp "Beginning Student"
gives
vector-ref: expects type <vector> as 1st argument, given:
#<struct:setting>, other arguments were: 1
