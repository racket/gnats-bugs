 Note: this was in drscheme-jr.  Don't know if the same problem is in
 drscheme.
 
    Thank you very much for your problem report.
    It has the internal identification `all/1473'.

 I am not able to reproduce this bug. Can you describe your steps, starting
 from a just-opened drscheme? (Also, are you really running on solaris?)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Though the error message doesn't say it, this is a DrScheme Jr, not
 DrScheme bug.  The bug was fixed a while back, and the fixed version
 will be available in our upcoming release, due out in a week or two.
 
 Thank you for your bug report and your interest in the software.
 Please feel free to contact us if you have other comments or
 questions.

 Aha! Thanks. I didn't realize that was drscheme-jr. It is fixed for the
 next release due out in a few days.
