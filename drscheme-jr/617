>Description:
To get here, you must comment out the last expression in
unitsig.ss, which tests dynamic linking.  Then you get to
file.ss, in which the following happens:

(apply #<primitive:open-input-string> '(1 1))  =e=>  open-input-string: expects 1 argument, given 2: 1 1
(apply #<primitive:get-output-string> '())  =e=>  get-output-string: expects 1 argument, given 0
(#<primitive:procedure-arity-includes?> #<primitive:get-output-string> 1)  ==> #t
user break
(apply #<primitive:get-output-string> '(1 1))  =e=> > 

after which DrSJr is awaiting further input.  The "user break"
appears automagically; I did not disturb the run in any way.
This happens consistently.
>How-To-Repeat:
Check out the MzScheme test suite.
In your copy, if the last test in unitsig.ss is for dynamic
linking, comment that out.
Run DrSJr with flags auto-else on, signal-undef off and case-sens off.
Load all.ss.
Sit back and wait.

 The "user break" comes from a test that calls break-thread on another
 thread. It's correct.
 
 The "user break" is probably not killing anything. This part of the
 test suite is tesing parameters, and there are still some MzScheme
 parameters that do not apply within DrScheme (ones related to
 compilation).
 
 One way around this is to evaluate
  (define in-drschem? #t)
 before running the test suite. It skips the parameterization
 tests. These tests are automatically skipped in DrScheme Jr.

 Sorry - my reply to this PR didn't make a bit of sense.  Please ignore
 it. I was looking at the wrong thing.

 Sorry, I should have mentioned: This bug is intermittent.  It doesn't
 appear every time.  I seem to recall that it showed up whenever you
 ran the whole test suite through but not when you ran thread.ss
 individually, but I could be wrong.  Fyi, I was running the test suite 
 on nw.
