Responsible-Changed-When: Tue Mar  3 14:35:06 1998
Responsible-Changed-Why:
Robby says it ain't his, so it's probably mine.  I'll take it off his
hands for now.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: shriram
State-Changed-When: Fri Mar  6 15:29:03 1998
State-Changed-Why:
These bugs have been fixed.  The default value being used for the
expander in M3 was incorrect.

The problem has also been fixed because MzRice no longer exists, so I
don't know what software this error is about. (-:
