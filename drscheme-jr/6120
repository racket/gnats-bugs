>Description:
Since 203 the loading of TeachPacks has been unstable on WinXP. I have experienced this on several machines, and it happens pretty consistent. 

My students add the TeachPack again (it is removed from the list on errror) and tries again. This often work, but it is
very irritating that you need to add the TeachPacks over and over again.

Is it possible that the offending TeachPacks aren't removed 
automatically from the TeachPack list?

 Perhaps I'm the only one with a problem here, but I have just a smidgen=20=
 
 of trouble understanding the problem that you state. Even if the=20
 problem is sporadic, it would help to provide more detailed information=20=
 
 in the How To Repeat section of the bug report.
 
 Here's the problem you're reporting, as I understand it:
 
 1) start DrScheme
 2) Add a teachpack
 3) run a program with <some kind of error>
 4) ! the teachpack is no longer in the list of teachpacks.
 
 Is this the problem you're reporting?  Your last sentence leaves me=20
 somewhat confused again. If this is the problem you're reporting, can=20
 you provide any info at all on what kind of error was reported? Or what=20=
 
 the offending program was?

 Well. Yes and no.
 
 There is two problems. The first is that the TeachPacks doesn't always load.
 (This was also reported someone else using also on XP - and it was suggested
 that he had local problems - so you could consider this part a me-too-bug)
 
 The second is that in the case of a load error, the offending TeachPack is
 removed from the list. If you use several TeachPack, it becomes annoying
 to add them several times. If they weren't removed, then one could simply
 press run again, and hope one is more lucky. I case the first bug is hard to
 find, then this change would remove a lot of the irritation.
 (is it possible to make DrScheme make two tries when loading a TeachPack?)

 In my case it was a little program that uses gui.ss and draw.ss - but since
 it almost always works in the second try - I think the specific TeachPack
 is irrelevant.
