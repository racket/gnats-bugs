>Description:
This is one of those "internal syntax error" errors (although
drscheme jr does not insert that string). The output of zodiac
is syntactically ill-formed mzscheme when being passed to eval.
This means that there is no source location for the error and
you get mzscheme's error text instead of zodiac's.

This happens in both drscheme and drscheme-jr. Note that this is not
a general problem with all keywords, the set! and lambda expressions
are handled correctly.
