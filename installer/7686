>Description:
The 299.400 OS X installer assigns ownership of collects/doc to system.
This is read-only to users and admins. Attempting to install manuals
through help desk results in various permissions-related failures.

I've worked round this by making myself the owner of collects, 
which may not be a good solution, but it works so far.

 There is nothing to do about this.  You must install new manuals as
 root.  Use sodo or some similar too.
 
 (The other alternative would be to make the directory writable by
 anyone, which is not a good idea for multi-user machines.)

 There is no solution -- either use permissions or not.  That's the
 bottom line that I remember from the very long fight I had with the
 OSX installer.  (I'll be happy to have some more OSX advice, but going
 through it again is a torture...)

 Well, the basic OSX problem is that they mix the pop-a-password-box
 issue, the who-owns-the-directory issue, and the where-is-it-installed
 issue.  All meshed up in a way that makes it very difficult to change
 one of these things independently.

 this is not an OS X-specific problem, I don' think.

 Yes it is -- the installer could be made just a little more flexible,
 like allowing users to choose the destination directory.  Also, it
 could have an option that installs things as the user (so for most
 people that works since they have a single user machine), but still
 ask for a password.
 
 Each one of these can have some solution, but with the OSX thing I get
 a few recipes that I can use and nothing else.  (Besides writing a new
 installer application.)

 So, this problem doesn't happen under unix? The idea there is that you
 have to bug your sysadmin to get manuals installed, but that that isn't
 a problem? 
 
 I guess we get less complaints from linux, but it seems like a problem
 in principle.

 Yes -- you either play your own sysadmin and are aware of the
 situation, or someone else plays that part for your so they're aware
 of it, or you just install it in your home dir.

 The OSX problem is that they try to be better than Windows, but not
 all the way to Unix.  In a sense, it would be easy to write some
 custom installer, but then you lose the advantage of Installer
 machinery.

 Did we explore the route where we let the owner for the part of things
 in /Applications be the user that did the installation (as if they had
 just dragged it in there)?
 
 I know we considered putting the docs into the user-specific part of
 the collection hierarchy and that didn't work, for some reason, but I
 don't recall why.
 
 Are there any other options?

 The problem, I think, is that the installer needs to write frameworks
 to /Libraries.
 
 There are a couple of reason to write frameworks to /Libraries:
 
  * Until recently, I didn't know how to make an executable find
    frameworks that are in an application-relative location. I have
    since learned about the "@executable_path" hack for shared-library
    paths.
 
  * Stand-alone executables shouldn't have to refer to the PLT
    installation directory to get the shared libraries. But the whole
    "make executable" system should probably be replaced with "make
    installer", anyway.
 
 So, maybe it's time to put the shared libraries into the PLT
 installation directory. I don't like this approach in principle, but
 it's worth considering.

 Implicit in there is the idea that the files in /Applications have to
 have the same owner as those in /Libraries and I think maybe that's
 what Eli was saying earlier? Is that right?

 Yes, and that was leading to other problems -- one was that it wasn't
 asking for password, and I think that there was also some other
 permission problem.  Ideally, it would allow you to choose the user
 you want to install as, as well as the location.

 Well, that's (I think) one thing ruled out the simple drag and drop
 solution.  Another thing is the need for running an installer, which
 is impossible (IIRC).

 But then the generated installers will need to put the shared
 libraries in a single place which will run into the same problem but
 one level down (and probably more difficult).  Otherwise, you'll get
 the libraries with every executable, which is the same as just dumping
 shared libraries...?
 
 (And BTW, I have no idea how that would look like on Windows.)

 Yes, it forces a "real Installer".

 That sounds, perhaps, useful for the bits that go into /Applications
 currently, but I think you made a nice argument for why the bits that
 go into /Library must continue to go there.
 
 When you wrote "Yes, it forces a `real installer'." you mean that we
 would have to write a new installer?
 
 A post-processing script won't work, I take it?

 No -- I meant a package that works with OSX's "Installer".  The
 alternative is seperate packages to be installed with drag+drop and
 more instructions.

 Perhaps -- but someone needs to see how to make a post processing
 script that actually runs when a package is installed by drag+drop,
 also, interface the system to do things with permissions in a way that
 plays nice with the rest of the system, and a nice addition would be
 to also register the package with the system as usual -- with a
 receipt and all that stuff.  This is what I meant when I said that an
 alternative is to write a custom installer.

 btw, on second thought, I want to question your earlier claim about
 linux. If I did choose to install plt as root, I would have to run
 help-desk as root (or be a clever PLTer but still then use setup-plt)
 which seems like something sysadmins don't like to do.
 
 BTW, don't be confused: I'm not trying to defend OS X; I'm trying to
 frame the problem properly.

 The current installation in os x uses some kind of installer with a
 post-processing step. I meant augmenting that post-processing step.

 Right -- which is why I always preferred installing the .plt files
 directly from a command line.

 Well, the problem of the extra documentation is currently a problem of
 administration.  One solution that I wanted to get to at some point is
 to make th Finish Install thing offer you to download and install more
 stuff, like the complete documentation.  That will solve this problem
 since it will run at the proper time, when installing -- as root or
 whatever.

 By writing the shell magic to change permissions to the user?  It's
 possible to change them, for example -- making it all world writable,
 but that would not be a good idea...  The only thing is if there is a
 way to change it to be group-writeable and have it belong to the group
 that does administration (admin?).  But that needs to be done manually
 by the shell script, I think, and need some OSX user to hack...
