>Description:
(as in summary)

- Users/xxx/Library/PLT Scheme directory search path does not
  appear to included as a default search path as in setup-plt)

- possibly related to 6381 problem report? (where r5rs, inside plt,
  tour, tyss, and teX2p, are now also being expliclty "skipped"
  during the "refresh all manuals" process, as they don't appear
  recogize the new default path is being used to store the docs
  for some reason?)

 This seems like one we should look into before the release, right? NEU
 seems to be down, so I cannot check to see if you've already done
 something...

 I haven't done anything. I haven't yet understood the bug report,
 actually, so by all means proceed if you have an idea of what it's
 about.

 It sounded like he isn't seeing zo compilation in those collections.

 Indeed, this is what he means (from the install transcript):
 
   setup-plt: Setup version is 205
   setup-plt: PLT home directory is /Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt
   setup-plt: Collection paths are 
   setup-plt:   /Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects
   setup-plt: Pre-Installing readline
 
 That happens due to this line in the install script:
 
   (current-library-collection-paths (list (build-path plthome "collects")))
 
 I suspect that it needs to be updated for the new default collection
 paths. I don't know if some function that computes the path location is
 exposed, but I guess that fixing that one spot will take care of
 things.

 I believe that this part is fixed now. Can you double-check with your
 installation?
 
 Thanks,

 yup ok, (although doc updates are still a little out of whack).

 As a minor point:
 
 - wonder if hard-coded "release-date" would be better changed to
   a soft coded "release-version" which could be picked up from
   include/schvers.h or more generic version file, which could
   itself be included by the include/schvers.h file?

 I looked at the discussion of this bug -- going back to that time in
 the life of the install script, I see that Matthew added the addon-dir
 to the list of library paths.  When I did my rewrite of the script all
 that was gone and now back to just the collects in the plt home
 directory.  I think that this sounds like a better choice for this,
 since `install' should just install the plt tree -- and other things
 should be installed later using setup-plt.  If there is any reason to
 include the addon directory, tell me, otherwise I will close this.
