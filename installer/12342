>Description:
Hi There,

I'm supporting a teaching lab in a University. Many instructors like to use PLT Scheme/Racket. And we are using it on Windows for years now.

There is this one feature I would like to have: make Racket installation silently - use a command line (with some switches) and the job is done!

The reason behind this is we are moving to WPKG and we need this. And I believe all of the organization users will be loving this. (To be hornest, we are moving away from the products which does not provide silent installers).

Thanks,

Johnny

Reason>>> Our Windows installers are made using NSIS, which supports a 
"silent mode" for such command-line use.  IIRC, you just 
need to run it with a "/S" flag.  See for example this page:
