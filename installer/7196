>Description:
I had this problem on previous OS X versions (208 and 207) as well:

By default, the PLT installer puts Dr.Scheme in /Applications/PLT Scheme vNNN (where NNN is the version number).  The instructions on the web page are incorrect: 

"Installer will not allow you to choose a destination, it will install the required support frameworks in /Library/Frameworks and the PLT folder in /Applications/PLT Scheme vNNN.
Finally, if you want to have the PLT tree at a different place, then move it to the new location and immediately open it and double click the Finish Install program. This might fail if you don't have the permissions - in this case you will need to use some tool to run this as the administrator (one such tool is "Pseudo"). Otherwise you will need to use command-line tools like sudo."

It fails, but not because I don't have permissions -- I ran it with full permissions.

The only way I could install it in the directory of my choosing was to edit to files in the mpkg:

.installer-parts/PLT Scheme v209.pkg/Contents/Info.plist
.installer-parts/PLT Scheme v209.pkg/Contents/Resources/PLT Scheme v209.info

This required that I first copy the mpkg to an alternate location (since the disk image is read-only), edit these files to reflect the new path for installation, then run the installer as normal.

Even though this may be non-trivial for the average user, at least the documentation should be corrected to reflect this.

>How-To-Repeat:
If you follow the install directions on the PLT webpage for OS X installs, then move the install to an alternate directory (I put mine in /Applications/Developer) then change to the /Applications/Developer directory and run "Finish Install", you will get many errors.  Using my corrected instructions above should work fine.

 The instructions are, in fact, correct -- there might a bug, but the
 described procedure is the correct one.

 Why/how did it fail?

 This will work, but definitely not the right way to change the
 destination.  There is no guarantee that these edits will be
 sufficient in the future, and in addition, it is unreasonable to
 require people to do these modifications to install in a different
 place, as most will not even know how to reach thess files.

 Most definitely not.

 In this whole description, you only say that "you will get many
 errors" but never say what errors you get.  This is the main source of
 the problem so please be more specific.

 OK, here is a detailed log of what happens when I try to install 
 Dr.Scheme to /Applications/Developer
 instead of /Applications:
 
 A. Install PLT Scheme in default location:
 
 1. Download plt-209-bin-ppc-osx-mac.dmg from drscheme.org
 2. Open disk image.
 3. Double click on PLT Scheme v209.mpkg
 4. At welcome screen, click "Continue".
 5. At destination screen, select (my only) volume and "Continue".
 6. Choose "Upgrade" (although I have removed the old version).
 7. Type my password for authentication.
 8. The software successfully installs to /Applications
 
 B. Attempt to move PLT Scheme from /Applications to 
 /Applications/Developer following these instructions which are found on 
 the web site:
 
 "Finally, if you want to have the PLT tree at a different place, then 
 move it to the new location and immediately open it and double click 
 the Finish Install program. This might fail if you don't have the 
 permissions - in this case you will need to use some tool to run this 
 as the administrator (one such tool is "Pseudo"). Otherwise you will 
 need to use command-line tools like sudo."
 
 1. Drag PLT Scheme v209 folder from /Applications to 
 /Applications/Developer
 2.

 Eerything in your email was fine, up until the description of the

 So the installer is fine.

 That's what I suspected -- so there is no bug there, you just didn't
 run it as root...  Don't you have that Pseudo tool?

 My guess is that `open' communicates with the running finder, so every
 time you used it you were running it as yourself instead of root.

 OK, I've sent a message to our Mac users and I'll see if there is a
 way to improve the instructions.
