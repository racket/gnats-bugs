>Description:
I innstalled DrScheme on my computer: win98 RUS. Installatation was completed without any mistakes. I did restart PC and then tried to run DrScheme. The window with progress bar appeared and when the progress bar was almost completed a windows error message appeared.

"Program DRSCHEMEE provoked a mistake of the memory security in modul GDI.EXE on address 0014:0000060f."

I tried to reinstall it but it didn`t help. I tried even to install previous version (204), but nothing changed.
