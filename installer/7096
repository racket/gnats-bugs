This program will extract and install PLT Scheme v208.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is around 54M.

Where do you want to install the "plt" directory tree?
  1 - /usr/plt [default]
  2 - /usr/local/plt
  3 - $HOME/plt (/home/SEIRADINC/callum/plt)
  4 - ./plt (here)
  Or enter a different directory to install in.
> 4
Checking the integrity of the binary archive... ok.
Unpacking into "/home/SEIRADINC/callum/download/scheme/plt"... done.
Running the PLT installer...
./bin/mzscheme: relocation error: ./bin/mzscheme: symbol __libc_stack_end, version GLIBC_2.1 not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference
Error: PLT installer failed.

 Seems that you're using debian or some debian based distribution.
 This has known incompatibility issues with libc, so we have added a
 debian-testing build for that.  For v208, however, you will have to
 compile from sources yourself.
