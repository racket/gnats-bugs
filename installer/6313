>Description:
I know that Matthias has told me that folks initially requested that Dr. Scheme only install for the user doing the install. This creates a problem for the teaching labs here since I have to install the software as the administrator so out of the box the students do not have access to the software.

If possible could you include the option of installing either for a single user or all users?

 There are two immediate issues here:
 1) what should the behavior be for the next release of DrScheme, and
 2) what should you do right now?
 
 Leaving aside #1 for the moment, is this an issue that prevents you 
 from installing DrScheme 204 on lab machines for the beginning of the 
 summer quarter?

suffers from the same problem, tell me.
