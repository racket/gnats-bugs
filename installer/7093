Hi there!

Just found out about the new 299.20 release...
which I highly appreciate because of the new background coloring feature!

Anyway, the installation just stops,
the PLT installer saying:
"Errors when running PLT installer, aborting!"

when looking into the Program folder I can see
MrEd.exe, MzScheme.exe, MzCOM.exe, install.bat, finish_install.exe,

but no trace of DrScheme.exe.

quite weird.

Hope to help you with that.
If you have any further questions please let me know.

Kind regards from Germany,

Markus

 At the end of the installation, a screen pops up and does some
 installation stuff.  That screen probably showed some error messages,
 can you look for them and mail them?

 Hmmm --- did you try to change the installation directory to be
 "PLT -299.20"?  Executing files that have a space in them can be
 problematic.

 I just tried it, and it still worked.  You might have problems if
 you're not running XP/2000/NT though.  But I guess that this is not
 your problem -- it looks like you typed that text, since it should
 say that it executes "...\MrEd.exe".
 
 Assuming I guessed correctly, then -- when files are installed, and
 you click the details button, you see text telling you what files are
 unpacked.  Right after that "Execute: ..." line, it should lauch a
 (MrEd) window with more installation stuff running in it.  That text
 would contain the error message that I'm looking for.

 OK, so this is not the problem.

 You mean that the MrEd window does pop up, flashes some lines and then
 disappears by itself?  Can you try running the setup manually?  To do
 this you need to do the following after the normal installation
 failed:
 
 1. Start a dos box window.
 
 2. cd into the plt directory.
 
 3. There should be a file called `install' there, run MzScheme.exe
    like this:
 
      .\MzScheme.exe -qC install -i
 
 This should run the same thing that runs in the MrEd setup window,
 except that it will be in the dos box.  If it shows any errors, mail
 them to me.

 Is this the actual *full* log?  If so, then something is really
 strange: the version should be "299.20" (dot, not comma), and it
 should say "setup-plt: Collection paths are ...".

 No.  What is it?
