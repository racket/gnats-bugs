>Description:
It would be great if DrScheme was distributed as an MSI file (Microsoft Installer) to enable installation and updating with Windows group policy.

Microsoft has information on this:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/winstall.mspx

http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/planning/management/veritas.asp

And the software to create it can be found here:

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by eli at Tue, 27 Jul 2004 14:05:28 -0400
Reason>>> Colin will provide more details when he finds out
information about creating msi files non-interactively.


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Wed, 01 Sep 2004 09:51:37 -0400
Reason>>> Installer issue.
