>Description:
When I run DrScheme, windows sends a dialog box to me :
"Drscheme a provoqué une erreur dans
LIBMZSCH205_000.DLL
Le programme Drscheme va maintenant être arrêté."
(Sorry, I'm french)
I would like to know if this problem can be fixed.
I've already tried to uninstall/reinstall DrScheme many times, and it seems that I'm not alone with this problem.
Thank you.
Fabien, french student
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install DrScheme 205 (sometimes, the error appear during the install) and run it. I have got the same problem with older releases.
