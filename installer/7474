"plt-299.100-bin-i386-linux.sh" calls "plt/finish-install" which requires "(require (lib "cmdline.ss"))".

The install fails with:
default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/usr/share/mzscheme/collects/mzlib/cmdline.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

because I do not have the plt libraries on disk.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run plt-299.100-bin-i386-linux.sh on a system without PLT already installed.

 Never mind.  I had an empty /usr/share/mzscheme/collects/mzlib/ directory on 
 the system from a previous install.  The rest of the previous install was 
 removed, but this artifact threw off the library resolver thing.
