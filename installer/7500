>Description:
I recently did a nuke of my machine, installed OS X 10.4, 
and began reinstalling software. I installed 299.100 from
the binary installer, and was circling back around to install
209 from the binary package as well. 

I ran the 209 installer, and after selecting a destination, 
all three items are greyed out, the "Action" column is listed
as "Skip" for all three, and if I click "Continue," then
the installer reports that there's nothing to be done. 
(Actually, it says "You cannot continue. There is nothing
to install.")

I can build from source, but this seems odd. Given that
the various versions of PLT Scheme can coexist peacefully,
it would be nice to have both the 299/300 series
and (for the immediate future) a 209 install.

Either way, I just thought I'd drop this note, in the
event that it's reproducable in some way. 

The account attempting the installation is a
non-priv. account, but then, that didn't matter when
I installed 299.100... hm. Kinda confused on this one.

Enjoy. :P

 There's not much to do about it -- the OSX installer is a huge PITA,
 and limited in all kinds of ways that *they* think is the right
 thing.  Normal distributions are built in a way that probably makes
 the installer think that you're trying to install an older version,
 and try to protect you.  You can try to remove 299.100, then install
 209, then try to install 299 -- if you do this, then it will be nice
 if you can tell me what happened.
