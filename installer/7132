State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sat, 22 Jan 2005 02:16:46 -0500
Reason>>> There are known problems that result from the fact that
debian tends to have very different setups.  You should
compile from the source tree for now if there are library
problems with the precompiled binaries.  We hope to have
a better solution for Debian in the near future.
