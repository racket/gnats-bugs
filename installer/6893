Running installer for mz-207-bin-i386-win32.exe produces output posted at:

www.ointment.org/mzscheme.html

This just hangs, as is. The only *.exe created seems to be the main mzcheme.exe, shouldn't there be others?

Thanks.

 Yes, there is a problem there...  Can you tell me what Windows version
 you're using?  Also, there should be a "finish install.bat" file in
 the PLT directory -- can you run it and see if it works or fails?
 (It will run in a dos box, so to keep the output visible it's probably
 best if you run it from a dos box.)

 No, there is no relation to Unix, just that the install.bat is renamed
 as "finish install.bat" but its contents not altered, somthing that I
 didn't notice so far.  Can you please confirm that it works if you
 edit the batch file so that line you were talking about:
 
   if not exist "install.bat" goto NoPathFound
 
 is modified to check for just install:
 
   if not exist "install" goto NoPathFound
 
 ?

 This is really weird.  Seems like PLTDIR is not set despite passing
 through the line right after the one you edited.  Can you try to run a
 batch file that has exactly this:
 
   set FOO=.
   echo foo is now %foo%
 
 if this doesn't print the dot, then this is a windows problem that
 I'll need to hack around.

 Well, there was a stupid typo in my text, it should have been:
 
   set FOO=.
   echo FOO is now %FOO%
 
 can you try that?  In any case, the error is certainly strange.
 
 (For you information, so far what I have is a batch file that looks
 like:
 
   ...
   set PLTDIR=.
   ...
   echo Could not find %PLTDIR%\MzScheme.exe or ...
   ...
 
 and on your system it prints nothing in place of the PLTDIR variable.
 My only hope for a solution is that windows somehow screws up the
 "set" line and does not set the variable to a single dot.  This is
 what I'm trying to debug through you -- I wish there was a way for me
 to try things out myself, it would have been way easier...)

 OK, good.

 Yes, it looks like things are fine.  I guess that the last bug that
 is left is the fact that when you run the batch file, it didn't
 complain that it is out of environment space.  This is a lost case...

 Given the respect I have for windows, this is definitely a rational
 thing, but I *hope* it wasn't necessary in this case.

 Well, not much I can do about it...  I'll leave it as it is.

 Well, you downloaded the MzScheme distribution that does not contain
 the GUI stuff which is what MrEd.exe is.  The reason it is in the
 batch file is that the same file is used to install GUI and non-GUI
 distributions, and if you do get the GUI version, then the installer
 runs a little better with MrEd (in a proper windows, instead of
 popping up a DOS box).
 
 So things are fine now -- I'll close this bug.  Thanks for your
 patience.

 It looks pretty clear to me that this is a problem with the Installer 
 not expecting spaces in pathnames.  Looks like an easy fix.  Eli?
