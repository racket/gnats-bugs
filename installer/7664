 The windows installer has been bogus for a few days now, due to some
 compilation problem (you're getting and old binary with new Scheme
 sources).  I think that I fixed it, and started a build -- I'll tell
 you when its done (and close the bug report).

 The build finished -- can you try it and confirm that things are fine?

 Does this problem still happen?
 
 I sloppily updated one of the built-in MzScheme modules without
 incrementing the MzScheme version number. I'm not sure how to arrive at
 the above situation, but I will update the version number to re-sync.

 The problem is actually a result of my neglect of the windows build --
 so the installer was using old binaries with new scheme sources.
