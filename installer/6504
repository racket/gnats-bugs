installation of newest version plt-205.exe on windows2000 PC, just downloaded at Uni TÃ¼bingen.
I also installed the pltdlls-205.exe jet. 

error message:

setup-plt: Error during General Install for ProfessorJ: libs java lang (C:\PROGRA~1\plt\./collects/setup/..\..\collects\profj\libs\java\lang)
setup-plt:   C:\PROGRA~1\plt\./collects/setup/..\..\collects\profj\libs\java\lang\Math.java:4:33: file-not-found: Required file Object not found in: file-not-found

Result: Only MzSheme runs.
