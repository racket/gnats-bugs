>Description:
When trying to install libs-301-bin-i386-win32 on my WinXP, the installer reports the following error:

Error opening file for writing:

c:\windows\system32\msvcr71.dll

This seems quite logical to me, since usually several tasks access the Visual C runtime environment. Because write access to an open file is not permitted, the installer cant do its job properly. If I choose to ignore and go on with the installation, I am not able to run standalone exe files. I tried at different XP boxes and the 300 version of the libs, getting the same result.

I think, that many people appreciate the ability of creating standalone executables, so I rated this one as seriousely.

 Thanks for the report. The version 350 series avoids this problem: it
 doesn't install into the system folder. Version 350 and up also
 produces executables with the needed support files, so that they are
 truly stand-alone.
