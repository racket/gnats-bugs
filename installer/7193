 I don't know why your PC restarted, but I don't think that there is
 any chance that the PLT installer is responsible.  At what stage did
 it restart?  Do you have winamp installed?  If so, then the same kind
 of installer is used by PLT.

 I assume that the problem is in deed related to Norton Go Back.  There
 is nothing in the PLT installer that should cause any PC to ever
 reboot.  I will close this bug now.
