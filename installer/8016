>Description:
SuSE-Linux 10.0 (2.6.13-15.8-default)

I have a commercial software-package for MrScheme which requires the 103p1-Release. It won't install under 301.

But all binary packages of 103p1 stop with a segfault on SuSE 10.0. All SRC-Packages do not compile.

>How-To-Repeat:
Version plt-103p1-bin-i386-linux.tgz stops with a segfault:

# bin/drscheme
Segmentation fault

The same goes for the RPM-Package. It throws a segfault while creating the .zo-files.

So I tried the source-distribution plt-103p1-src-linux-rh.src.rpm and also the non-rpm-source-package. Both stop at the same place:

 That's not surprising -- v103p1 is ancient -- it is an almost
 5-year-old patch for the 6-year-old v103.  Unfortunately, we don't
 have the resources to maintain old versions.
 
 Things that I can say are:
 
 * There is no hope of using the binary distributions on modern
   machines, enough binary stuff has changed to make it useless on a
   modern machine.  This goes for any kind of binary distribution.
   (Actually, when I think about it -- there is no point in keeping
   binary distributions for more than a few years, only the sources are
   of potential value.)
 
 * You should start from source -- but instead of messing around with
   the source rpm, start with the generic unix sources.
 
 * If you really want to make v103p1 work, you'll pretty much be on
   your own -- a much easier task is to convert the Scheme sources to
   work with v301.  If it's commercial and you don't have the sources,
   then you should ask the authors to do this.  If you do have the
   sources, then you can start the conversion process and use the
   mailing list (plt-scheme.org/maillist) if you run into problems.
 
 I will close this bug now.

 This might be the case, but try limit the stack size to 8MB before
 running DrScheme (via `limit' or `ulimit', I think, depending on your
 shell). If I recall correctly, that was one of the first things to go
 wrong as OSes changed since the v103 release.

 I'm willing to help out, but it's a busy week for me, so it may be slow
 going. The initial round of compile errors doesn't look familiar, so
 I'll have to take a look tomorrow or Tuesday.

 You mean that limiting the stack size on a new linux can improve
 chances of old executables?  (In any case, I really doubt that the
 latest suse has compatibility libc/glibc versions that will work with
 5 year old binaries...)

 Yes. The problem was that Linux variants started reporting a max stack
 size of 4GB (minus one) for "unlimited" stack size. This made
 MzScheme's pointer arithmetic overflow when computing the end of the
 stack. By setting the stack limit to 8MB, you avoid the bug in
 MzScheme.
