 Can you send the text that appears in the window when it gets stuck?
 
 Jamie -- do you have Win98se on the test pc?

 The installer did not change from v207, so you should be able to run
 the 208 installer too.  So I assume the problem was elsewhere and will
 close this bug (unless you try 208 again).

Reason>>> installer

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 13 Aug 2004 18:33:10 -0400
Reason>>> Seems like a non problem since the 207 installer is fine.
Should reopen if it is reproducible.
