>Description:
In mz-369.6-src-unix.tgz, the xml collect file text-snipclass.ss requires "framework" and "mred" which are not and should not be in the mzscheme-only installer.  This prevents building from succeeding.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build from source using mz-369.6-src-unix.tgz.  During "make install" when setup-plt gets to the XML collect, it fails because:

setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for XML (/var/tmp/portage/mzscheme-369.6/image/usr/lib64/plt/collects/xml)
setup-plt:   standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found: "framework" in any of: (#<path:/var/tmp/portage/mzscheme-369.6/homedir/.plt-scheme/369.6/collects> #<path:/var/tmp/portage/mzscheme-369.6/image/usr/lib64/plt/collects>)
>Fix:

Reason>>> fixed for the next build

 Thanks for catching this -- there's code in our bundle script that
 scans dependencies, and it looks like that code has been broken for a
 while.  It's fixed now, and the next build will be fine.
