>Description:
I am trying to automate installation on 40 machines
running fedora core 3.  Previously I did kickstart
installations and automatically installed drscheme
using rpm.  The present self install shell script
requires responding to a dialog.  I tried installing
on one machine, and then copying the plt tree to
other machines.  When I execute drscheme after
copying, I get messages like:
compile: variable not provided (directly or indirectly and at the expected posit ion) from module: |,/usr/local/plt/collects/web-server/internal-server| in: prov
If I do the installer script, this does not happen.

How should I automate installation?

 Do you mean that you get the error when running DrScheme, *after* the
 self-installing script finished (successfully)?

 That's fine, I'll close the bug now.
