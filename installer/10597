>Description:
It didn't pop up. 
A command window says:
Existing binaries were compiled 4.2.2.9.
The version mismatch happend.

I hope 4.2.3.2 doesn't have this issue.

ENV. Windows XP SP3.

Reason>>> Yes, there are some problems with the windows build, due to
changes that are being done on the source.  Hopefully, these
problems would be resolved soon.  In the meanwhile, you can
try the pre-release candidate for version 4.2.3, available
at http://pre.plt-scheme.org/release/installers .
