>Description:
Attempting to install plt-208-bin-i386-linux-debian.sh in /usr/local.

Platform is Libranet GNU/Linux 2.8.1.  The kernel is Deb 2.4.21. The install dialog is:

root@libranet:~# cd /usr/local
root@libranet:/usr/local# ls
bin    include  man  plt-208-bin-i386-linux-debian.sh  share
games  lib      plt  sbin                              src
root@libranet:/usr/local# sh plt-208-bin-i386-linux-debian.sh
This program will extract and install PLT Scheme v208.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is around 55M.

Where do you want to install the "plt" directory tree?
  1 - /usr/plt [default]
  2 - /usr/local/plt
  3 - $HOME/plt (/root/plt)
  4 - ./plt (here)
  Or enter a different directory to install in.
> 2
Checking the integrity of the binary archive... ok.
"/usr/local/plt" exists, delete? y
Deleting old "/usr/local/plt"... done.
Unpacking into "/usr/local/plt"... done.
Running the PLT installer...
./bin/mzscheme: relocation error: ./bin/mzscheme: symbol __libc_stack_end, version GLIBC_2.1 not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference
Error: PLT installer failed.
root@libranet:/usr/local#

file ld-linux.so.2 is /lib/ld-2.3.2.so in the above Libranet 2.8.1 distro.

How can I resolve this problem?

 Debian is a tricky platform, I don't know of any sane way to create an
 executable that will work on all (common) Debians.  Your best bet is
 to get the source and compile it yourself.
