 Which version of Mac OS X, specifically?
 
 I ask because DrScheme currently works only on Mac OS 10.3 and later
 (and we corrected the web page to note this). I wonder if you have
 10.2, or if the problem is something else.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I'm having the same difficulties with 301.9 under OS X 10.4.5.
 
 When the installer script portion of the install begins, I get the message
 "There were errors installing the software". "Please try installing again."
 I've removed previous installations, including frameworks, but the results
 are the same.

Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Wed, 24 May 2006 14:53:32 -0400
Reason>>> The new version (available from pre.plt-scheme.org/installers)
does not have an installer part for Macs -- it's a simple
drag & drop installation.  There might still be a problem
though when you try to run it -- if this is the case, please
submit another bug report.  Thanks.
