>Description:
Just downloaded the "PLT Scheme" option for Mac OS X (Intel) from <http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/>.  Upon copying the folder out of the disk image to my home directory, I tried to run plt-help and got the following error message:

[perdita:~]$ plt-help
0:67: execution error: File some object wasnâ€™t found. (-43)
browser-run: process execute failed: (#<path:/usr/bin/osascript> "-e" "open location \"file:///Users/cobbe/Applications/plt/doc/index.html\"")

And indeed, ~/Applications/plt/doc/index.html doesn't exist.

Running setup-plt didn't help.

Reason>>> Will fix, hopefully within the next few hours.

 Yes, that's the same error that you see on docs.plt-scheme.org.  I'll
 get to it as soon as possible.  (I'll close this PR now, but not
 because I'm ignoring it -- I think that I was told about from about 7
 people in addition to your report...)
