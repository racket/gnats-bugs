 Hello,
 
 I retrieved a .deb package from the unstable branch of Debian containing 
 the 206p1 release. It works!
 
  From my point of view the case may be closed.
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.
 
 Michael

 Well, we're working on a new release now, and I'm adding a Debian
 build.  For some strange reason Debian always had problems even with
 the older GCC2 build.  So I have a quick question for you: I have
 access to either Debian 2.0 or 3.0 machines, is there any preferable
 platform for a Debian build?  (I don't know if either is the "stable"
 one, I just have access to one of the machines that is mentioned on
 http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/info/services/debian_new)
