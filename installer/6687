>Description:
The previous version installed was 205. I deinstalled 205 during the 206 installation
but requested that the user preferences be kept.

During the last part of installing 206 (Setup) MrEd crashed.

There was no DrScheme executable available.

I reinstalled 205 and that worked.

Then I reinstalled 206, this time requesting that 205
***and*** the user preferences were removed.

Installation was OK this time.

Regards
-Barry

 Can you please tell me what exactly happened?  Did MrEd completely
 crash, or did it stop and showed you some error message?  If it did,
 what was the error message?

 (I've tried to repeat these steps but I didn't get your error, so the
 only thing I can do is ask you for more details...)

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Thu, 01 Apr 2004 22:08:52 -0500
Reason: Installer issue

View:
  http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/query/?cmd=view+audit-trail&pr=6687

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Thu, 01 Apr 2004 22:08:52 -0500
Reason: No answer.  In any case, there is not much to do -- the 
installer is completely different so it is better to just 
remove any traces of v205.
