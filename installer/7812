>Description:
When I click one of the uninstalled manual links at the bottom of "Manuals" in the Help Desk, the Installer Progress window pops up, says "Downloading foo..", then "Deleting old version of foo...", then finally: 'delete-file: cannot delete file: "/Applications/PLT Scheme v300/collects/doc/foo/hdindex" (Permission denied; errno=13)'.  When I check the file, I see that it is owned by system/admin and I do not have write permissions, even though I installed DrScheme using the same account I ran it with.

I expect it to install the manual, using this account; that was the behavior in previous versions.

 This is a problem with the way our permissions are set up under mac os
 x. It is a long sad story, but one we hope will have a happy ending in
 v302.
 
 In the meantime, if you change the relevant folder's permissions you
 should be able to get the docs installed. Let me know if you need help
 with that.

Reason>>> The installer for OSX was changed so the resulting
installation is writable by anyone in the admin group.
IIUC this means any user with administration priviliges
on OSX.  (see also PR7912)
