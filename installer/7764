i want to uninstal it from my machine but a weird message pops out, saying that it is corrupted and i have to contact the author of the installer; seems it has damaged my system, i want it to be removed, please help.
it seems to be buggy, because it has changed the configuration of some other windows softwares.
i keep getting error messages saying critical error on the system is detected.
please help, i need to remove it, so that i can detect the real problem on my system.
thanks.

 The installer is a standard one -- it's the same kind of installer
 that is used by winamp and lots of other applications.  I have never
 seen such a message, but together with ethe critical error you have it
 sounds like something else is not right.  Perhaps some antivirus is
 getting in the way?  Perhaps the system has been broken by a virus?
 
 In any case, you can simply remove the PLT directory from your
 program files folder.

Reason>>> The installer is a standard Windows installer, like the one 
used by WinAmp.  If you have problems removing the 
application, contact me via email.
