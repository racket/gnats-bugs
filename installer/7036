Subject: Debian package does not check for dependency of xlib6g (libxsaw6)

>Description:
When installing the package for DrScheme 208, installation aborts because the package does not check its dependency upon libxaw6.
 It simply warns and aborts. The refered library is part of another one:
samadhi:/home/synthesp# apt-cache depends xlib6g
xlib6g
  Depends: xlibs
  Depends: libxaw6
  Conflicts: <chimera>
  Conflicts: <jgroff>
  Conflicts: <metro-motif-bin>
  Conflicts: <metro-motif-demobin>
  Conflicts: <netscape3>
  Conflicts: wily
  Conflicts: <xarchie>
  Conflicts: <xmailtool>

 Therefore it would be ideal for the DrScheme package to check its dependency of xlib6g and automatically download it if found missing.
 There are no warnings and no tips provided on this matter.
 I discovered it merely by chance, having failed to install DrScheme and subsequently installing GCL (which requires the same library too).


>How-To-Repeat:
Simply try to install the DrScheme v. 208 Debian "package" from DrScheme's site without xlib6g installed;

 The Debian package is not maintained by PLT, you should contact the
 packager directly.
