>Description:
Hi there,

I am working on a project that requires some XML-RPC kind of stuff and I found this library(XchemeRPC) that seemed to help me out. The download was made from "http://www.cs-ed.org/blogs/mjadud/" . Accordint to the web page, "XchemeRPC is a library for PLT Scheme (Mz/DrScheme) 200 and above that implements both an XML-RPC client and server. It is copyright Matt Jadud 2002, and released under the LGPL."

After the download Dr.Scheme simply stopped working. I can't open a single file(.scm)! As soon as I try to open Dr.Scheme the following error message shows up:

open-input-file: cannot open input file: "C:\Documents and Settings\David Nunes\Application Data\PLT Scheme\206p1\collects\web-server\internal-server.ss" (The system cannot find the file specified.; errno=2)

[Exited]

Why? What caused the problem?

I have:
1.unstalled and installed it over and over, no success./
2.I have restore my computer to a certain point in the past in order to go back to the same configuration before installing this Xcheme thing. No success.

I dont know what to do. I need some help! I have to work on a project and without even opening Dr.Scheme to edit some code, I think it is impossible unless I get another computer.

Thanks for you attention.

David Nunes.

 Do you have any news about this?  Did you try to contact the author of
 the XchemeRPC package?
