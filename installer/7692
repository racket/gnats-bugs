 Thanks.
 
 Is it possible you forgot to run either "install" or "setup-plt" ?

 Okay. We'll look into it (mostly I'm just re-adding the cc's to the

 Your bug report is very confusing -- I can't figure out whether there
 is a problem when you use the binary installer, or compiling from
 source, and I don't know what is the error that you see.  Can you
 please provide a clear description of the error and a sequence of
 operations that reaches it?
 
 Also, please keep the CC list intact (use "reply to all"), so your
 replies are recorded properly.

 I believe he wrote that he gets the error message when submitting
 
   (+ 1 (* 2 3))
 
 (or similar) to the REPL in DrScheme, in the teaching languages (but
 not in r5rs).

 OK - let me go through the whole lot
 
 1. I wanted to learn scheme, so  I downloaded and installed 
 plt-299.400-bin-i386-linux.sh.  I installed in on suse 9.3 and suse 10
 
 2. DrScheme loads fine and everything works in interactive window
 
 3. I tried the examples from htdp and teach yourself scheme and everything 
 entered in the interactions window failed with the error message 
 
 on clicking run:
 compile: identifier used out of context
 
 when using the stepper:
 in the step window:
 expand: unbound variable in module
 
 This occurs in all the teaching languages, but not  R5RS.
 
 4. I dowloaded plt-209-bin-i386-linux.sh - this segfaults when installed on 
 suse 10
 
 5. 1 Downloaded the 299-400 source tarball and this segfaults on suse 10 
 unless configured with  --share-enabled 
 
 6. When the tarball is compiled with --share-enabled under suse 10, everything 
 works fine.
 
 In other words the problem is that when you install the DrScheme linux binary 
 distribution, it is partially broken under suse 9.3 and suse 10. 
 
   
 Marko

 Did you start from a completely fresh installation?
 
 DrScheme is used by many people, and the above errors could not have
 passed silently.  Do you have anything exceptional in your
 environment?  Any strange things in your .plt-scheme directory?
 
 I don't have access to any suse machines, if you can setup a guest
 account I can ssh to your machine and investigate further.

 Suse 10 is probably too new -- version 209 was compiled a while ago.

 This also sounds strange -- the default is to use shared libraries, I
 don't see why you needed to change it.  Also, it's not clear *what*
 exactly is segfaulting.

 I cannot replicate any of these problems.  The best guess I have is
 that somehow your environment got messed up with files from multiple
 installation attempts.  Again, since you're using linux, then it would
 probably be easy to find the problem if you can set up a guest
 account.

 No, the default is --disable-shared. (We experimented with
 --enable-shared as the default for a while, but it's currently back to
 --dsiable-shared.)
 
 I'm surprised that DrScheme would segfault without shared libraries and
 work with them. Any more information that you can provide about the
 location of the fault (e.g., a stack trace for gdb) would be much
 appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 This was a completely fresh installation of suse 10 and the binary install.  
 It's running on an amd XP2800.  
 
 I just did a suse 10 install into a vmware virtual machine and the binary 
 works fine, so it must be something to do with the hardware here.  I have a 
 matrox parhelia graphics card which is not well supported under linux (do not 
 buy one!) otherwise it's generic hardware - gigbyte mainboard etc.  
 
 the --share-enabled was definely needed to make it work.
 
 I'll see what I can find here later today, with framebuffer graphics and I'll 
 try to find out where the segfault occurs. 
 
 I will leave it up to you if you want to look into it further and I will set 
 up an account if you need one.
 
 kind regards,

 Then things are even more strange -- I don't remember any DrScheme bug
 that are due to hardware differences.

 If possible, then that would be useful -- I can grab a core dump
 directly and see what exactly is crashing (and how).

 We finally found a way for me to use Mark's machine (through VNC...),
 and I managed to get the same problem he did -- sometimes I can use it
 fine, but when I quit I get a segfault, and sometimes it gives a
 segfault immediately (with 299.407 I only got the first case).  I did
 not see a single segfault-less use.  The same thing happens when
 running mred directly.
 
 I got a core dump, and this is what gdb says:

 The libGL is supplied by matrox to run the parhelia series cards.  This is not 
 the suse supplied libGL.

 Does this libGL require pthreads?

 Matrox does not provide full source code however libGL.so does contain the 
 following strings
 pthread_mutexattr_init pthread_mutexattr_settype

 The VNC connection dropped, but it looks like I'm done.  (If Matthew's
 right, you should compile with GL turned off, since MzScheme doesn't
 play nice with threaded code.)
 
 I'll move the PR to Matthew now.

 An alternative is to compile with --enable-pthreads. This has minor
 drawbacks: 
 
  * It makes MzScheme avoid signals for scheduling threads (so thread
    swaps are less regular, but still usually good enough)
 
  * It makes MzScheme assume a stack size of 1 MB (so internal stack
    overflows may be more common, but typical recursion depths shouldn't
    overflow).

 Compiling with --enable-pthreads does not help.

State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:44:10 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
