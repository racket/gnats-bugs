I have MacOS X version 10.2.8 with a 400 MHz PowerPC G4 processor. I downloaded DrScheme for "Macintosh OS X ppc", and when I tried to install it, an error message appeared at the end of the installation, and I cannot launch the program. I tried to reinstall it after deleting all installed files, and the same problem reappeared. How can I do? Thank you for answering.

Reason>>> 10.2 is not supported by newer installers

 The PLT installer will not work on 10.2 -- you need at least 10.3.  As
 an alternative, you can try to get the sources and compile, but I'm
 not sure that this will work...
