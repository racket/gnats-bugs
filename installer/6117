I was trying to install Dr Scheme on my XP platform but it wouldn't install the whole thing, and when it gets to 100% it gets stuck and it opens the command line for mzscheme and it won't work again unledd i close the command line, is there a way to fix that?

 When you see the command window open, you need to wait for some time for
 MzScheme to build .zo files.  It may take a few minutes.  How long did
 you wait?
 
 During installation, you can choose not to build .zo files, although
 that's probably not a good choice.

 OK.  After deleting any existing installation in Program Files\PLT, try
 installing without building .zo files.
 
 Then run MzScheme, which you can start from Programs | PLT Scheme |
 MzScheme.  Inside MzScheme, enter
 
   (require (lib "setup.ss" "setup"))
 
 Does it finish then?
