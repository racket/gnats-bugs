Installation fails. This is on an up-to-date installation of Ubuntu 5.10. Please see following copy+paste from the install:

user@host:~/Desktop$ sudo sh plt-299.400-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu.sh 
Password:
This program will extract and install PLT Scheme v299.400.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is around 77M.

Where do you want to install the "plt" directory tree?
  1 - /usr/plt [default]
  2 - /usr/local/plt
  3 - $HOME/plt (/home/user/plt)
  4 - ./plt (here)
  Or enter a different directory to install in.
> 2
Checking the integrity of the binary archive... ok.
Unpacking into "/usr/local/plt"... done.
Running the PLT installer...
./bin/mzscheme: relocation error: ./bin/mzscheme: symbol __libc_stack_end, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference
Error: PLT installer failed.

 The older Ubuntu that you used is not compatible with 5.10.  For v300
 which will come out soon, we have added an Ubuntu 5.10 build.
