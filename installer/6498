>Description:
Hello,
I installed the PLT for Linux RedHat. But I have Linux Mandrake 9.1. 
I,ve done all the steps by the instruction on the download page but the DrScheme (graphical environment) doesn´t work. However the MzScheme is working well.
When I´m trying to write ´drscheme´ to bash, the answer is this:
¨/usr/local/lib/plt/bin/mred: error while loading shared libraries: libpng.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory¨
Please, could you tell me what I´ve done wrong or what I´ve to do.
Thank you

 You should have `libpng' installed.  Doesn't Madrake has that?  (try
 to run "locate libpng.so")

 You have a different version of the libraries installed on your machine
 than the versions that the installation was compiled with.
 
 I reccommend that you download and try to install the source version.
 It takes longer to build, but it should build without problems.
 
 Let me know if you get stuck.
