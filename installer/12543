 Did it mention anything about which files it considered to be malware?

 Your question: "
 
 Did it mention anything about which files it considered to be malware?"
 
 
 First of all, I found the version#... I copied/pasted this following
 line out of the "README" file--> This is the Racket v5.2 binary
 package for Windows.
 
 To answer your question, yes it did list all the files considered to
 be malware, but I'm not able to recover that list right now.  I will
 look later, but as of right now, I can provide you with a current
 directory-listing so you can use the process of elimination to
 determine which ones it removed, that is, all the ones that are not in
 this listing, but should be, were obviously removed:
 
 collects
 doc
 include
 lib
 mzc.exe
 MzCOM.exe
 mzpp.exe
 mzscheme.exe
 mztext.exe
 pdf-slatex.exe
 planet.exe
 plt-r5rs.exe
 plt-r6rs.exe
 plt-web-server.exe
 Racket.exe
 raco.exe
 README
 scribble.exe
 setup-plt.exe
 slatex.exe
 swindle.exe
 tex2page.exe
 Uninstall.exe
 
 Sorry, but I did not provide listings for the sub-directories.  Again,
 I'll look through the Norton interface to try to find records, and
 I'll then send them to you.
 
 ~Mike

 Following up to bugs.
 
 These appear to all be GUI executables.

 Okay, I was able to find the records in AVG's "virus vault."  I
 noticed that McAfee detected them, but for some reason, AVG moved them
 to "vault."
 
 Here are the contents of AVG's vault:
 "Infection";"Trojan horse DoS.CAU";"c:\Program Files (x86)\Racket\PLT
 Games.exe";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:08:13 AM"
 "Infection";"Trojan horse DoS.CAU";"c:\Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\gracket-text.exe";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:08:39 AM"
 "Infection";"Trojan horse DoS.CAU";"c:\Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\GRacket.exe";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:08:40 AM"
 "Infection";"Trojan horse DoS.CAU";"c:\Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\mred-text.exe";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:08:42 AM"
 "Infection";"Trojan horse DoS.CAU";"c:\Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\Racket Documentation.exe";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:08:44 AM"
 "Infection";"Trojan horse DoS.CAU";"c:\Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\Slideshow.exe";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:08:44 AM"
 "Malware";"Unknown";"C:\PROGRAM FILES
 (X86)\RACKET\DRRACKET.EXE";"N/A";"2/7/2012, 1:06:01 AM"
 
 I doubt this is your fault.  I think it might be more likely that
 these files became infected, from an outside source, after
 download/installation of Racket --- OR the scanner just incorrectly
 detected them as malware.
 
 Anyway, after you resolve this, I would like to see what the problem
 really was caused by.
