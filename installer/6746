Sorry to bother you again.

Thank you for your quick responce.  Im not sure what you mean by im not using the right language.  As im learning Scheme by reading from a Scheme book and the errors I gave are from examples in that Scheme book.

You are right in that I have an old version of scheme.  This is because when I tried to install the version from www.drscheme.org  I get the error "Error opening file for writing C:\WINNT\system32\libmzsch206p1_0.dll" 
Hit abort to abort installation, retry to retry writing the file, or ignore to skip this file". 

I think I am getting this error because I'm trying to install the program on the H drive, we are not allowed access to the C Drive in college.  The version Im using at the moment I copied from a Scheme folder I had on my computer at home but I downloaded it 5 years ago.  So maybe i am missing something although I copied the whole folder.  I don't know is there any way around this ? 

Thank you for your time

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Thu, 01 Apr 2004 22:19:28 -0500
Reason: There is not much to do about this -- installing software 
on Windows when you don't have permissions to write to 
system directories is a hopeless effort.
