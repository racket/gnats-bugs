>Description:
I downloaded the file plt-299.100-bin-ppc-osx-mac.dmg,
opened the disk image to find PLT Scheme v299.100.mpkg, 
ran it, and the progress bar got to about 95% I got
"There were errors installing the software.
Please try installing again."
Which I've done several times, with freshly-downloaded installers,
to no avail.

 I don't suppose you got a log file?
 
 Are you out of disk space, by chance?

 There a bunch of files that are created with all kinds of information
 that OSX never actually uses...  It will take considerable efforts to
 identify the problem -- I'd say that it would take me about an hour if
 I could actually sit at the terminal, but doing this remotely is going
 to be close to impossible.
 
 Can you verify the size and checksum of the file?
     The size should be 15578906 bytes
     Running the `cksum' command on the dmg file should show this:
       3456491756 15578906 plt-299.100-bin-ppc-osx-mac.dmg
     Running the `md5sum' command on the dmg file should show this:
       9f7ef3d64a3c731f978c5e5b545c31bb  plt-299.100-bin-ppc-osx-mac.dmg
 
 Do the pre-built installers work fine?

 So -- I missed the fact that you're trying to do this on 10.2.  It
 seems like the file installation went fine, but its the executables
 which won't run -- and I think that there were some changes that make
 it a problem to use under 10.2.  Your best bet, besides the obvious
 upgrade, is to get the source distribution and re-build it.

 OK, so I'll close the bug.
 
 (If you do want to build it from sources, I can help -- it's pretty
 easy.)
