>Description:
I am unable to install drscheme on my debian system. When I run the shell script I get the following output:

$ sh plt-208-bin-i386-linux-debian.sh 
This program will extract and install PLT Scheme v208.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is around 55M.

Where do you want to install the "plt" directory tree?
  1 - /usr/plt [default]
  2 - /usr/local/plt
  3 - $HOME/plt (/root/plt)
  4 - ./plt (here)
  Or enter a different directory to install in.
> 2
Checking the integrity of the binary archive... ok.
"/usr/local/plt" exists, delete? y
Deleting old "/usr/local/plt"... done.
Unpacking into "/usr/local/plt"... done.
Running the PLT installer...
./bin/mzscheme: relocation error: ./bin/mzscheme: symbol __libc_stack_end, version GLIBC_2.1 not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference
Error: PLT installer failed.

-----------------------------------------------
I have tried all three of the linux doenloads and they all return the same error message. I am running debian testing/unstable. I'd appreciate any help you can give me.


Thanks,
Brian Laferriere

Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 19 Oct 2004 19:43:12 -0400
Reason>>> Added a debian "testing" build.
(For the new builds, with 208 you will need to compile the
tgz yourself...)
