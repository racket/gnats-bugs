I tried:

both version 299.30, updated at Monday, February 07 2005, 04:20 EST
and version 299.30, updated at Monday, February 06 2005, 04:20 EST
;
both full-299.30-bin-i386-win32.exe and plt-299.30-bin-i386-win32.exe

and the install always abouts with the following message:


standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found: "mzlib" in any of: (#<path:C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\PLT Scheme\299.30\collects>)
standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found: "mzlib" in any of: (#<path:C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\PLT Scheme\299.30\collects>)

[Exited]

It seems to me that the standard-module-name-resolver went wrong. It should try the "all-users" directory once and the "plt" directory once.

 Can you specify an exact description of how you got this error? --
 What user were you connected as, what choices did you make in the
 installer, where did you choose to install the PLT directory, etc?

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Mon, 07 Feb 2005 18:21:43 -0500
Reason>>> installer

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 07 Feb 2005 18:21:43 -0500
