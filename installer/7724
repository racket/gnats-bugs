 The problem with Ubuntu is the same as the one with Debian --
 different Ubuntu versions have different libc versions.  You can try
 the default Linux build (it's built on Fedora Core 2, and I think
 that someone mentioned that it works on Ubuntu), otherwise you'll need
 to build from the source.
 
 Is there some Ubuntu lab in Utah?  If so, perhaps I can add one of
 these machines to the build script and have a newer Ubuntu build?
 
 (I'm closing the bug now.)
