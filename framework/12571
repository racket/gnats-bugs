>Description:
An Editor does not correctly soft-wrap the line below the current line if that line contains a hyphen. If a line is extended so as to push text to the line below (i.e. to the line containing the hyphen) the second line will be extended beyond the width of the editor's container, as if the editor has miscalculated the number of characters in the line containing the hypen.
Correct soft-wrapping is easily resumed; if the line containing the hyphen is edited directly (e.g. by adding and removing a hard newline) or if the line is extended so that the hyphen is pushed beyond the limits of the container.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket bug report form.
In the description field, add text amounting to two or more lines.
On the second line add a hyphen.
Return to the first line and add more text so as to cause the line to re-soft-wrap and push text to the second line. The second line will not re-flow correctly, pushing text beyond the limit of the editor's container.
