>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open new tab ("Module custom", #lang scheme)
2. Run (by pressing command-t)
3. After the interactions window clears, but right before the > prompt comes up in the REPL, hit [ key
4. Watch DrScheme give you an internal error.

My [ key does do the automagic ([-insertion. The same error happens when hitting it when an expression is running in the REPL. I think it happens with other keys, but my only systematic testing has been with [.

Once borked, the interactions pane and stop/run stay broken. Closing the tab and reopening the file is necessary to be able to use the interactions pane for that file again.

This is repeatable with new tabs ad nauseum in my current instance of DrScheme. I'm not sure if it'll survive a DrScheme restart; if you can't replicate it, though, my instance will probably still be running for a while.
