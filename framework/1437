add block comment to definitions window
add some function
type alt-i (or indent all) and watch how

 It turns out that the tabber does not indent lines that begin with 
 three semi-colons. I have changed this to lines with 2 semicolons for 
 the next release.

 That is definately in the province of the paren matcher. Sorry, can't help
 there...
