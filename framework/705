>Description:
DrScheme was changed to keep distinct last-directory state for
the File|Open and Language|Set Library menu items. But it
doesn't seem to work; I get some stange behvaior. See
How-To-Repeat, below.
>How-To-Repeat:
1)
   Start DrScheme
   Select "Set Library to"
   Go into the "teach" directory
   Hit "Cancel"
   Select "Set Library To", again
   You're back in the "lib" directory

  There may be no way around this, but it's not nice.

2)
   Start DrScheme
   Select "Set Library to"
   Go into the "teach" directory
   Select a library
   Select "Set Library To" again - fine; you're in the
     "teach" directory
   Select "Open File"
   Hit "cancel"
   Select "Set Library To" again - the directory is no
     longer the "teach" directory; instead, you
     start wherever the "Open File" dialog left off.

  This is clearly wrong. And it's very confusing if you change the
  directory before clickong "Cancel" for "Open File". In that case,
  "Set Library To" will return to whatever directory you had open
  when hitting "Cancel", while "Open File" will go back to it's
  intial directory! (Then, of course, "Set Library to" starts in
  "Open File"'s initial directory.)

Responsible-Changed-Why:

The last part of this cannot be fixed without changes to the mred
system. It's also not clear if we want this change (althought I am in favor 
of it). I believe that all mac apps work this way (cancelling preserves the 
directory state) so we should also do that.
