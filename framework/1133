When quitting DrScheme with an unsaved definitions window,
an autosave file is left behind even when I click the "Close anyway"
button in the unsaved-file warning dialog.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Type in the definitions window
Wait for autosave file to be created
Quit DrScheme
  => "File is not saved" dialog - click "Close anyway"
     "Really quit?" dialog - click "Quit"
Autosave file is still there
