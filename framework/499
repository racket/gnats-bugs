>Description:
Typing in the program between the --- lines results in strange indenting
behavior.  Repeatedly pressing tab or ^m i to indent all moves the []'s
back and forth by two spaces.

---

[]
---

This problem occurs in a larger program also.  In that case, everything
starting with the first non-blank, non-comment line shifts back and
forth by two spaces.

The problem does not occur without the blank line.

[]

Also, when flash paren match is turned on, the expression:

(      1  )

flashes the wrong place. It flashes the character just before the 1, rather 
than flashing the open paren.

Also, when typing this:

  (     1  )]

the second paren is turned into a curley brace and a flash happens before
the first open paren!
