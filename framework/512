>Description:

When selecting the preference for "show keybindings in menu", the
keybindings aren't removed for open frames, only in new frames. It would be 
nice if they were removed in open frames as well

Responsible-Changed-Why:

I am changing this to be Matthew's responsibility becuase it is still quite 
error prone to implement this (although possible) with the support that
mred has right now. 

If I were to implement it, I'd have two choices:

 1) add a preference callback for each menu item -- bad becuase there is no
    "close" method for menu items (to remove the callback and allow for gc)
    and it is a wasteful implementation.

 2) do some clever hacking overriding on-demand and set-shortcut to turn
    off and on the shortcut at the right time. This is error prone.

If, however, the on-demand method were extended so that it was called both
before and after the menu was popped up, I could temporarily turn the
shortcut off and back on again while the menu was popped up.

Note:  the keybindings currently have no effect when this preference is on
becuase on-subwindow-char is overridden and the keybindings are
just dropped. That is why the bindings still appear in the menu, but have
no effect.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

We think that using option 1, but setting the callback on the frame
instead of menu item, should work.

fixed, using the variant of option 1 described above.
