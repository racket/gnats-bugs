>Description:
It would be nice to have reasonable defaults for all named params in
the new (new element-type% [(param ...)] ...) call form; for example
(label "un-named") (width 64) (height 64) (callback (lambda (x y)))
but not sure if there exists an innocuous choice for (parent ...),
that may allow it to be displayed in some default frame or something.

Where the thought process is to allow some basic item to be displayed,
and then sucessively refined, without requireing much if any params
initially defined.

(and BTW, noticed the GUI Builder comming along, nice!)

(Personally, I don't see a point in all-defaultable

 How about so a beginner can simply instantiate a new window by:
 
 (define my-window (new window)) ; or whatever
 
 From where, one could then successively refine things as truly desired.
 
 [maybe not a good idea, but was the basis of the suggestion, and it also
  seemed reasonable for all parameters to be both named, and have defaults]
 
 But concede, it's not likely a big deal, just seemed nicer, -paul-
