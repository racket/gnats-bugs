>Description:
For the second time in two weeks, I got DrScheme into a state 
where the search buffer is open, and I typed in a string that 
clearly appears in the Definitions window yet Dr/Mr/Sequire
refuses to find. Instead, the dear Dr decides to beep. 

Makes me very unhappy. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I sincerely regret not being able to reproduce this bug on 
demand, but I decided to report this state becaue it happened
a second time. Perhaps people can pay attention and see whether
they just happen to know how to get out of the state and their
fingers work around it. 

(I don't know how to get out of this state. If I figure it
out, I will add it to the bug report.)

 Okay, I got out of this stupid state: 
  erase everything
  use tab to go thru all fields and buttons
  type things in again 
 
 BTW, I can close and re-start search in this state and Dr always beeps.

 Could the problem be that you managed to paste a carriage return into
 the search buffer? Then, text would be scrolled up in the search text
 box where you can't see it.
 
 I used to do that often (years ago, back when I used a Mac).
 
 The non-dialog version of the search window has two lines. I think it's
 a really good idea (Robby's), even when the user can't type a return
 directly into the search box. If the caret is on the second line, the
 user knows something fishy has happened.

 I was actually trying to replace something so a search-pure buffer wouldn't
 have helped. 
 
 I doubt it was a newline because I typed this thing from scratch. 
 But I do recall that the entire text-field was black before I started 
 typing (selected?).

Since this isn't reproducible, it is not useful. I have made the search
window two lines tall so that will help if it is the problem Matthew
suggests. the change will be released when I next release drscheme.
