>Description:
As  you can see below, the contract for this function is:
(string? . -> . (listof string?)).  However, its sole arguement listed as key is later revealed to be just one of three argumments.  It takes a keymap a string? and func.  keymap's type can be deduced to be of type keymap%, but nothing is said about the expected arity or return type of func, or more specifically in this case, where one would find valid func's that made sense in the context of a keymap%.

Thanks,

>How-To-Repeat:
keymap:make-meta-prefix-list in Framework Functions

* (keymap:make-meta-prefix-list key) -> (listof string?) 
   key : string?

This prefixes a key with all of the different meta prefixes and returns a list of the prefixed strings.

takes a keymap, a base key specification, and a function name; it prefixes the base key with all ``meta'' combination prefixes, and installs the new combinations into the keymap. For example, (keymap:send-map-function-meta keymap "a" func) maps all of ``m:a'' and ``ESC;a'' to func.

 I think the contract is right, but maybe I'm mis understanding your
 bug report? Here's what I tried:
 
   Welcome to DrScheme, version 369.10-svn19apr2007 [3m].
   Language: Graphical (MrEd, includes MzScheme).
   > (require (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))
   > (keymap:make-meta-prefix-list "a")
   ("m:a" "ESC;a")
   >
 
 Maybe you wanted to use keymap:send-map-function-meta instead? The
 `func' there is a named function that is already bound in the keymap.
 It isn't a Scheme procedure.
