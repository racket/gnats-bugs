>Description:
cache-image-snips appear to be stored very inefficiently when an editor involving one is saved to a file. It appears to be a text representation of an uncompressed bitmap. In one test, a buffer containing a bunch of images was saved by DrScheme in a 400MB file, and it takes DrScheme many minutes to open the file again. Even simple gzip compression reduced the file size to ~50MB.

Requests:
- improve the space usage
- improve the time to load/save
