>Description:
The decision for using find as a dialog or not is done in an
unintuitive way.  Given the intense GUI contamination these days,
a much more intuitive way would be to have a "dock" button on the
dialog and an "undock" one on the other one, and clicking them
should have an immediate effect.
Currently, I don't even see any way to switch back to the dialog:
the "hide" button will hide it but a later search will use it again
instead of the dialog.
