 I have fixed the bug here, but you may want to duplicate the fix on
 your own copy of drscheme. To do so, go to line 11 of sparen.ss in
 PLTHOME/collects/framework. Replace the definition of quote-pairs with
 this:
 
   (define quote-pairs '(("\"" . "\"")))
   
 You may want to rebuild .zo files after that.
 
 Hope that helps.
