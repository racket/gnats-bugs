>Description:
Including a semi-colon on a line, even if it is in a string literal (ie: between double quotes)
prevents correct parenthesis highlighting and matching for characters following the semicolon.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the line:

([ ";"

Then press the ) key. This should get changed to a square bracket and the text between the two square
brackets should be highlighted.

Instead, the ")" character is inserted and no highlighting occurs.

 Thanks, Pete. Well known bug. There are all kinds of problems like that
 with the paren matcher.
 
 I don't suppose you'd be interested in writing a better one?
