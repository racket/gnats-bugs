>Description:
Some of the formatting operators are misapplied.  Here is an example from section 27, "Text", documenting "highlight-range" in "text:basic<%>"; note the code around "start", "end", "bitmap", and "#f" that has not translated into formatting:

The range between \var{start} and \var{end} will be highlighted with the color in color, and \var{bitmap} will be painted over the range of text in black and white. If \var{bitmap} is \rawscm{\#f}, the range will be inverted, using the platform specific xor. This method is not recommended, because the selection is also displayed using xor.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look up the "highlight-range" method of "text:basic<%>" in the Help Desk documentation.

 Whoops! Thanks for noticing. I thought I'd made a pass over the docs
 to get rid of all that, but I guess not. I've just checked in changes
 that get rid of lots and lots of latex-isms, but if you see more
 things, let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
