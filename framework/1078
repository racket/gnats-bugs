behind their backs:

delete-file: cannot delete file: "/afs/informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/home/spe=
rber/soft/lula-mred-100/documentation/manual/#mredauto#4#"

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Type into the definitions window and save
Modify definitions window
Wait for autosave file to be created
Delete the autosave file
=> can't quit DrScheme
