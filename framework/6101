>Description:
I recently had a problem with using editors in frame:editor% that have instantiation arguments. This was a result of make-editor using make-object and not instantiate. I am now getting a very similar problem with using my own canvas.
I am going to make the following change to line 796 of collects/framework/frame.ss
s/(make-object % (get-area-container))/
(instantiate % () (parent (get-area-container)))/
>How-To-Repeat:
(require
 (lib "class.ss")
 (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))

(define mycanvas%
  (class editor-canvas%
    (init (foo #f))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define window%
  (class frame:editor%
    
    ;; get-canvas% (-> (derived-from editor-canvas%))
    ;; The result of this method is used to create the canvas for the editor<%> in this frame.
    (define/override (get-canvas%) mycanvas%)
    
    ;; get-editor% (-> (implements editor<%>))
    ;; The result of this class is used to create the editor<%> in this frame.
    (define/override (get-editor%) pasteboard%)
    
    (super-instantiate ())
    ))

(instantiate window% ())
