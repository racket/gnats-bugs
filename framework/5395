>Description:
Maybe nobody's going to get in tizzy about this, but the
auto-paren-correction feature, which is quite nice, is
sometimes a pain!  In some contexts, a character is quoted
even if it doesn't realize that it is, so it incorrectly
tries to match parentheses.
>How-To-Repeat:
Consider the code

  (regexp-match "([^%]*)%\\(.*%[^\\(

The next thing I want (need) to type is a

  ]

but the paren-corrector won't let me.

 FWIW, the auto-corrector is tied to typing the keystroke ")" or "]" or
 "}", so you can copy and paste or something like that.
 
 As far as fixing the bug goes, it's a known one.... and an old one.
