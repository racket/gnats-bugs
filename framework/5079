>Description:
I have "Enable keybindings in menus" off, yet
Alt-f, Alt-s, etc capture the menu keys.  This makes
Emacs-style editing (where I constantly use Alt-f)
impossible, and the constant appearance of menus
is very annoying.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up drScheme in Windows.
Ensure preference (third from last in General).
Type something, go back, hit Alt-f.
