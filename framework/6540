>Description:
Scott's real-time syntax highlighting is very nice, but it slows down
complex editing tasks (like moving large chunks of text from one file to
another).  Unfortunately, I can't disable the silly thing! Clearing the
relevant check box in the prefs doesn't help: any files I subsequently open
are automatically colored!
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme; open a large file.  If syntax coloring isn't on, turn it
on, and ooh and aah over the pretty colors.  Then turn it off; the file
should be black.  Open a new file; notice the pretty colors again! Check
the prefs box; note that the coloring check box is still cleared.

 I'm guessing that you probably need to install a callback on the pref
 that sets the check box, rather than setting it directly (except
 initially, of course). This is probably not the whole answer to the
 bug, but what Richard suggests indicates you need this.
 
 To test: try the cancel button the in preferences dialog.

 I'll get this problem fixed soon.
 
 When you turn the coloring off do in get a noticeable speedup?
 Could you compare the speed of editing in the system with the coloring  
 on, with the coloring off and also before the colorer was added?  What  
 hardware are you on?

 I do have the callback.  The bug was that the default setting in the 
 colorer was always set to #t without checking the value of the 
 preference.
 
 As you suggested, I tried cancel and am pretty well baffled by its 
 behavior.  When I toggle the preference, the colors turn off and on 
 correctly and when I cancel they turn back to how they started, but the 
 button in the preferences panel is not turned back.  Is there anything 
 special I need to do to manage preference cancels?

 You shouldn't have to do anything special, as long as the state of the 
 checkbox is toggled by a preferences callback. I'm not sure why you are 
 seeing what you are seeing. Perhaps putting a printout in the 
 callback(s) to see what is being called might help?
 
 Also, just do double check, are you removing the link between the 
 preferences system and the paren matcher (probably in the form of the 
 callback) when the frame closes?

 Looks like I copied and pasted the bug over when I stole the color 
 prefs code from check syntax.  The bold/italic/etc. buttons exhibit the 
 exact same incorrect behavior on cancel that I'm seeing here.
 
 Right now I'm only removing the callback when the surrogate becomes 
 disabled, which does not happen when the frame closes.  This is a 
 memory leak, right?

 I've fixed and exp tagged the bug you reported.
 
 Further bugs Robby and I have discussed with respect to Cancel have not  
 been fixed, and I don't plan to fix them soon, since they are in Check  
 Syntax too and so must not be critical if no one has noticed them yet.
