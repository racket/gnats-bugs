>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
Comments introduced with semicolons confuse the indenter.  See below for details.

I can reproduce this problem on 207.2-cvs26jul2004 (Windows XP) but *not* on 207-cvs9jul2004 (Linux), which suggests that it's a recent change that caused this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Insert the following text into an empty definitions window:

(module foo mzscheme
  
  (require (lib "class.ss"))
  
  
  (define c%
    (class object%
      
      ;; md :: X Y Z -> A
      (define (md x y z) ...))))

Put the cursor at the end of the comment line (contract for md) and hit enter.  The cursor then moves to the very beginning of the following line; I'd instead expect it to appear at the point immediately under the first semicolon.

If you change the comment to a multi-line comment (#| ... |#), the indentation behaves as expected.
