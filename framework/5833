>Description:
The README file found in collects/tests/framework/ seems to be at odds
with reality.  Here are the problems I have found:

1.  ``All of these tests reside in PLTHOME/tests/framework/'' appears
    to be incorrect.  PLTHOME/tests/ does not have a framework
    subdirectory and the tests appear to be in
    collects/tests/framework/

2.  The README file refers to a program named "framework-test", but
    it appears that the program name is "framework test".  There is
    also a program named "framework test engine" but that seems to be
    the test slave.

3.  The instructions suggest running "framework test" with an argument
    of 'all' to run all the tests, but doing so just prints out "All
    tests passed."

4.  The instructions suggest running "framework test" with no
    arguments to repeat the previous test, but that appears to run all
    the tests.

5.  The following tests mentioned in the README file do not appear to
    exist:  "edit-canvas.ss" "canvas-frame.ss" "edit-frame.ss"
    "search.ss" "info-frame.ss" "scheme.ss" "autosave.ss" "close.ss"
    "quit.ss" "inheritance.ss"

6.  When running the tests, the `Are you sure you want to exit?'
    message box pops up several times.  It seems that you must click
    something to continue testing, but this is not mentioned.

7.  The following tests appear to fail:

    >> schedule:   group-test.ss // windows-menu
    >> schedule:   text.ss // text:basic-mixin-creation
    >> schedule:   frame.ss // basic%-creation
    >> schedule:   spec-test.ss // contract-flat2
    >> schedule:   exit.ss // exit/prompt/no-twice


>How-To-Repeat:
Read the file collects/tests/framework/README

 Thanks for pointing out these problems. I haven't kept the readme up to
 date.
 
 As far as the failing tests go, that's a problem with the testing
 infrastructure that I haven't tracked down. If you run the tests
 individually (by supplying the name on the commandline) they should all
 pass, except for possibly the handler.ss test (I forget which revisions
 of the tests made it into v202).

 The tests mentioned before fail when run individually.

 I ran them and checked the output before releasing v202. The framework
 doesn't have any bugs in it that the tests discover.

 When running the `text.ss' test, it reports a failure if you select `exit'
 from the `Are you sure you want to exit?' message box. It seems to run
 ok if you select `cancel'

State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Wed Sep 18 00:02:32 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    the test suite wasn't up to date with
    the latest exiting behavior (and the new
    entry in the windows menu). This has been
    fixed. Also, the README should be more
    useful now.
