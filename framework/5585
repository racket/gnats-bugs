>Description:
When I enter a comment that is long enough to go to another 
line the any parens in the second part of the line will 
match parens in code above. This is illustraited by putting 
the cursor on the paren and seeing a gray box appear covering
the previous set of parens.

Note1: I think that there should be a preference to turn word wrap off.

Note2: The newlines in this program may get trashed due 
to the form it's being typed into. It is pretty obvious where the newlines are to go I believe. the function should
be three lines total (define, comment, body)
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (function n)
  ;;this line is too big to fit on one like of my drscheme window and thus ends up word wrapping (being enter onto a new line) and matching the parens that I type into the comment (this one) all match the open paren near function. However the syntax checker properly colors this long line base-color (brown)
  (add1 n))
>Fix:

>Release-Note:
the code was using the "line" instead of the "paragraph"
methods to access the editor. The difference between the
two is autowrapping.
