<space><space>another-bunch-of-characters
<ctrl-d>

open this file in DrScheme, with contour window on.  See that
the two lines are left-aligned.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    The following program seems to not work
    properly:
    
    (define 1-pixel-tab-snip%
      (class tab-snip%
        (printf "1-pixel-tab-snip\n")
        (init-rest args)
    
        (define/override (get-extent dc x y wb hb db sb lb rb)
          (printf "get-extent\n")
          (set/f! wb 0)
          (set/f! hb 0)
          (set/f! db 0)
          (set/f! sb 0)
          (set/f! lb 0)
          (set/f! rb 0))
        
        (define/override (draw dc x y left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret)
          (printf "draw\n")
          (void))
    
        (apply super-make-object args)))
    
    (define t (make-object text%))
    (define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 200 200))
    (define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
    (send f show #t)
    (send t insert (make-object 1-pixel-tab-snip%))
    (send t find-first-snip)
    
    the result of the last expression is #f
    (I expected it to be the tab snip). 
    
    This probably explains why I don't see the 
    printfs for on-extend and draw.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    fixed framework bug (also, tabs didn't work when
    character appeared before the tab. that's fixed
    now, too)
