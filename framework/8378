>Description:
Hi!

I am using a french canadian keyboard (Canada CSA) under Mac OS X.4.8, which means that for making a "more than" or a "less than" symbol, I normally type Alt-. et Alt-, respectively. However, with your keyboard shortcuts, I can't type these symbols. Each time I try, the cursor goes up to the top or down to the bottom of the window. How can I type these symbols with my french keyboard or unactivate the shortcuts?

Thanks for your answers.

 If you have a chance, can you try version 359.100, which is available at
 
   http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/
 
 We have changed the way some keyboard events and keybindings are
 handled, and I wonder whether the changes work better (or worse!) for
 you.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Robby,
 
 The issue here is that "<" and ">" are typed with the Option key, so
 the MrEd-level event is "<" and ">" with Alt on. Meanwhile,
 "framework/keymap.ss" uses "a:" as as prefix for meta- bindings under
 OS X, where "a:" means Option.
 
 I think probably "a:" shouldn't be used as a meta- prefix on Mac OS X.
 Or maybe it should be used only when `(special-option-key)' returns #t.
 
 Matthew

 I think that's going to be a big change: people are used to the emacs
 bindings working with the alt key, in general.
 
 Is an option the right thing here? (default: a: is not a meta-prefix)?

 I don't think anyone can be used to it on the Mac, though. Option
 combinations produce alternate characters, such as "œ∑´®†¥" instead of
 "qwerty" in a U.S. configuration. I'm pretty sure that Option is used
 that way on all Mac keyboard configurations.
 
 [Beware of SirMail. I added `(special-option-key #f)' long ago, so
 Option can be used for Emacs-style combinations. But I think I don't
 actually use the keybindings that makes available.]
 
 > Is an option the right thing here? (default: a: is not a meta-prefix)?
 
 An preference might be useful if it's combined with setting
 `special-option-key'.
