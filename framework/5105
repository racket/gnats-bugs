>Description:
Was this deliberate? It appears (please, let this not be a
MacOS bug) that the contour skips lines that contain only 
a newline.  See below for clear illustration of what I mean
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new buffer.type
aaaaaaa#\newline#\newlineaaaaaaa

... that is, a bunch of a's separated by two newlines.  Now, look
at the contour window.  The two solid bars are not separated at
all.  Now, position the cursor on the empty line (the one that
contains only a newline). Hit #\space. In the contour window, see
how the two bars suddenly have a gap between them.  Delete the
#\space.  The gap now disappears.

State-Changed-Why:
    fixed -- not to worry, it isn't macos-specific.
    
    I don't think that a contract would have caught this one,
    the behavior is reasonable. The bug: invisible snips
    have height 0 instead of height 1. This only shows up
    when an entire line has all inviisble snips. The flaw
    (wrong height invisible snips) would not be a 
    contract violation
