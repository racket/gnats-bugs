There are a couple of spots in this manual that look odd - but I don't know if some stuff has been lost - or if the manual is just incomplete.

 That was a bug on the documentation source. It has been fixed now
 (there was one other, similar bug that I also fixed). Thanks!

 It should be complete, but it is just meant to be a reference manual,
 not a tutorial introduction (which is a problem, I know  ...)
