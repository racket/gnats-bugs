I don't think that there is a contract violation that could have caught
this (at least not easily). This particular bug just shows up as bad

 The column numbers are supposed to match mzscheme's numbers, so they
 intentionally keep counting there. (they don't match mzscheme column
 numbers right now, but that's because mzscheme is planned to change,
 but hasn't yet)

 Oh, right. That problem. I do know about that one (funny that I didn't
