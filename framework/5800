>Description:
When using the frameless Help Desk, if you change
one of the search parameters that is a pop-up menu,
the search works correctly, but then the search "panel"
at the top of the result page resets the popups
back to their defaults.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start Help Desk
Change the search to "keyword entry"
Search for "cons"
Notice that a search from the result page uses 
  "keyword or index entry" instead of
  "keyword entry"

State-Changed-When: Tue Sep 10 12:10:48 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed.  The change to the selection "takes" when you hit
    the Search or Lucky button.  If you make a change, and hit
    Reload, you'll get your original selection.  I could change
    that, but it's probably not worth the Javascript it would take.
