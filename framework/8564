>Description:
If I create a frame:basic% object in a custodian that I then shutdown, subsequent attempts to create new frame:basic% objects (under the original custodian) fail. The error message suggests that the framework is keeping a list of frames around and calling methods that fail on custodian-deleted frames.

The error:
. is-shown? in window%: object (shutdown by a custodian): #<struct:object:...red/private/wxtop.ss:552:4>
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's a program that produces the error:

(require (lib "class.ss")
         (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
         (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))
(define c (make-custodian))
(parameterize ((current-custodian c))
  (parameterize ((current-eventspace (make-eventspace)))
    (send (new frame:basic% (label "frame") (width 500) (height 500))
          show #t)))
(custodian-shutdown-all c)
(new frame:basic% (label "frame2") (width 200) (height 200))

 Is it possible to detect that a frame has been shutdown, other than by
 catching an exception? I'm not seeing how, but maybe I'm missing
 something in the manual?

 (eventspace-shutdown? (send f get-eventspace))
 
 But I thought the answer to the PR was that the framework isn't
 remotely safe for multiple eventspaces. Has that changed?

 Oh, I hadn't thought about it. The framework doesn't hold onto frames
 anywhere else (I think) so this seemed relatively isolated.
 
 Is there something systemic that I have to worry about?

 I imagined that there is other state (that would become "shared state"
 with multiple eventspaces), such as in the preferences system.

 But none of that state is affected by an eventspace, is it? Its
 hash-tables and things.

 Why did you want multiple eventspaces with the framework? It isn't
 really designed to work in a multithreaded setting.

 Oh, I'm feeling stupid -- its multiple custodians that are fine, but
 multiple threads that aren't.
 
 I'd better ask for some context with the original PR.

	shutdown

 Well, I discovered this behavior when I was running my tests in
 schemeunit. The tests started, popping up macro stepper frames
 (frameworkized frames). I told schemeunit to kill the testing session
 (not released to planet yet), which it does by calling
 custodian-shutdown-all. Then I tried to run the macro stepper again from
 the repl to see how one particular case behaved, and it failed to create
 the frame.

 Oh, I see. Yeah, the framework doesn't expect threads running it to
 die and then other threads to run its code.
 
 Maybe you should organize the tests so they have a separate namespace too?
