>Description:
There's a bug in the PDF version of the framework manual, section 3.1, just downloaded from download.plt-scheme.org 10 minutes ago.  Under the "Entire Framework" bullet, the middle two bullet entries display as follows:

=================== BEGIN QUOTE =============================
– (require (lib "framework-sig.ss" "framework"))
This library provides the signature definitions: #1ˆ, and #1ˆ. The frameworkˆ signature cotains
all of the names of the procedures described in this manual, except those that begin with test:
and gui-utils:. The framework-classˆ signature contains all of the classes defined in this manual.
– (require (lib "framework-unit.ss" "framework"))
This library provides one unit/sigs, § in PLT MzLib: Libraries Manual: #1@. It exports the
signature frameworkˆ. It imports the mredˆ signature.
=================== END QUOTE ================================

First, the section reference into the MzLib manual is broken, but more importantly, the names of the signatures and unit/sig appear as #1^, #1^, and #1@.

Everything displays as expected in the help desk (with framework manual downloaded as of 8/5/04).
