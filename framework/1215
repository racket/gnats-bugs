Hi!

I just installed the PLT V100 for Windows NT, and installed the patch as 
well. But I found that I can not keyin the back slash "\" with the keyboard. 
But I can keyin it with V53. I wonder if this is a bug or it  is your 
intention?

Thanks and Regards!

 More specifically, do you have to use the Alt key to type "\"?
 
 If so, you can probably fix the problem by commenting out line 732
 in plt/collects/framework/keymap.ss:
 
   ;       (map-meta "\\" "remove-space")
 
 We're working on a more permanent fix for the next release.

Yes, I am living and working in Finland. Do you have any idea how to fix the 
problem? Or is there another patch coming? Thanks for your kind reply!
