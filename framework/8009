>Description:
Section 3.2 of the Framework documentation gives a brief introduction to mixins.  The section where it mentions what provides mixins is deprecated, and should be changed from:

    (require (lib "macro.ss" "framework"))

to:

    (require (lib "class.ss"))

Reason>>> It looks like the section on mixins got copied from the framework manual to 
the mzlib manual, but never got deleted from the framework manual. It's 
gone now. thanks for pointing it out!
