>Description:
It would be great if the contour window could 
show the actual size of an embedde, say, XML
box so that navivating with the contour places 
the box properly in the definitions window.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    I've fixed part of this problem.
    
    There is a larger problem with the way resizing is handled by
    the contour. I'm not sure how to fix it, so I'll just leave it alone
    for now. If you get stuck as you resize snips, just hide and re-show
    the contour window and things should be back to normal.
