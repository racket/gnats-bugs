 It doesn't seem right to override the user's preference ... but maybe
 I'm missing something?

 This is with font smoothing disabled, right?
 
 Assuming so, maybe the style delta that makes text red and italic
 should also enable smoothing --- Robby?

 Yes (I like the text sharp).

 I was thinking that the user doesn't ask for red and italic errors, but
 I forgot that those features are actually configurable.
 
 In that case, I'm not sure if there's anything we can do, except to
 provide a separate smoothing choice for errors (in addition to italic,
 bold, the color, etc.).

 Judging from  my own experiments, it looks like Andrew disabled font
 smoothing, and turned the font size to 10, in addition to switching to
 Monaco?
 
 I guess the only thing to do is to add that check box.
 
 And maybe forward this bug report to Apple(?).

 Any objects to getting rid of the underline check box? The prefs
 dialog is getting kind of big ...

 And, just to be technical, it is a style-delta that's being
 configured, not a font. I have avoided the full blow configuration
 because it was just more clicking. I could, I guess, replace the space
 taken by the underline check box with a button that opened a more
 general thing that also included smoothing.
 
 Something for another day. For today, the dialog just gets wider.

 You'll kill having underlined keywords...  Wouldn't it be better to
 somehow use a different layout?  (Like choosing the font to modify and
 have a single set of controls work on that alone.)

 The problem might be that the Monaco font simply does not include  
 italicized characters - the system font dialog does not offer italics  
 as a typeface when I pick Monaco. When using a font that does offer  
 italics (such as Courier New) these characters appear just fine  
 (without using Font Smoothing).

 Well, "constructive objection"...

 (Right, I couldn't think of a better term.  All I hade was the Emacs
 term `face', which is similar to a style-delta.)

 I was thinking of doing it the other way: a list-box on the LHS shows
 all the deltas with their chosen colors and settings, you choose one
 and on the RHS you see checkboxes for configuring that one.

 It would probably make sense to generalize the `get-font-from-user'
 dialog to have a style-delta mode. I'll look into that.

 Can you make it amenable to Eli's earlier suggestion? Perhaps have a
 set-delta method that refreshes the controls to the state of a given
 style-delta and some way to make the controls in a panel that's given?

 I imagined that it would be a separate dialog:
 `get-style-delta-from-user'. It would take a base font and an initial
 style delta, and it would return a new style delta.
 
 Does that match what you had in mind?

 I'm asking for more. But I believe it should be only a little bit more.
 
 In particular, take the code that has that dialog and instead write a
 function that accepts a panel, fills the panel in with the controls
 that would go into the dialog. In addition, provide a separate
 function (perhaps returned from the panel-filling-function) that
 accepts a style delta and updates the state of the controls to the new
 delta, and causes clicking on the controls to update the new delta.
 
 I think that, once you've implemented the dialog, making the change to
 the functionality above should be easy. And that interface makes for a
 better GUI setup.
 
 Does that make sense?

Reason>>> Thanks for the bug report!

I've added a choice item that lets you configure the
smoothing for each of the font/color choices in the drscheme
preferences.

Turn smoothing back on for errors to see the quotes.
