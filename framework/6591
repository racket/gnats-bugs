>Description:
When using "Save Definitions As" on an already-named file, the "Save" dialog comes up with the message "BAD DIRECTORY: (filename)" above the directory list. The directory list is empty (save for "..") and the file list is also empty. Clicking the ".." directory does go back to the current working directory.

The dialog should open with the last directory the file was saved in.
