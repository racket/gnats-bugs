>Description:
Using the name "recur" in any let statement in DrScheme interactions or 
execution window causes abnormal indentation.
Example
(let ((recur
          "text"))
  recur)
Instead of 
(let ((recur
       "text"))
  recur)
as expected.
The same happens with let* and letrec. Indentation with (define recur ...)
works as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
type in:
(let ((recur 
and hit enter in either an execution window or interactions window of 
DrScheme

State-Changed-When: Fri Sep 24 15:13:22 1999
State-Changed-Why:

The formatting code does not acutally know about the language; it assumes
that things (like macro.ss) are loaded when it makes indentation
decisions. This will not be fixed soon....

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    This is an indenting bug that the new paren matcher doesn't fix.
State changed from "open" to "suspended" by robby at Tue, 04 Jan 2011 21:13:38 -0500
Reason>>> suspend

State changed from "suspended" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 15 Aug 2012 20:42:12 -0400
Reason>>> unfortunately, not going to happen (at least not due to the prompting in this PR).
