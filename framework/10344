>Description:
If there's an image in the middle of a line that's commented, the comment color stops at the image and the rest of the line is colored as if it were normal code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create line with image in middle. Add semi-colon to beginning. Tilt head in confusion.
>Fix:
The lexer for Scheme wasn't treating specials properly in comments. It does now.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error. It was just the wrong behavior in a parser.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 24 Jul 2009 00:37:31 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

(This will not go out in the (imminent) release)

Thanks for the report!
