>Description:
It would be useful, and consistent with OS X applications (e.g. TextEdit), if the user were able to use the command-D keyboard shortcut to trigger the "Don't Save" button in the "The file <filename> is unsaved" dialog.

One might also allow command-S to trigger the dialog's "Save" button; this is much less useful, and isn't an OS X custom, but it might be nice if one could do everything easily with the keyboard.  (ESC already triggers "cancel".)

This has been reported at least twice before, but I am reporting it again.

 Please fix this. Recent OS X releases moved to cmd+backspace as the standard, but I'd be happy with cmd+d as well.
