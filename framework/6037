 Hi Paul, 
 
   What did you expect the esc-n keybinding to do?

 Maybe you wanted esc-p? That does seem to work for me. Here's what I
 did:
 
   - type 1<return>, 2<return>, etc up to 10<return>
     into the interactions window
   - esc-5-esc-p
 
 and I get the 5th previous input (ie, 6)
 
 esc-n also works in the same way, except that it goes back forwards in
 the history, so if, after the above, I type esc-3-esc-n I get back
 forwards 3 elements in the history and see 9 at the prompt.
 
 Robby

 Thanks, that helped, was confused by the "Keybindings" window, indicating:
 
 ESC;p (goto-position) [within edit frame, but previous in interaction frame]
  and
 ESC;n [doesn't appear in the "Keybindings" list at all]
 
 (maybe the "Keybindings" list should be frame context sensitive?)
 
 P.S. also noticed that:
 
 - ESC;del (backward-kill-work) doesn't work in either, there may be others?
 - and that one of the "undo:'s as being mapped to an unprintable character?
 - and that one of the "undo"'s is capitalized as "Undo"?
 
 Thanks again for your help, -paul-
