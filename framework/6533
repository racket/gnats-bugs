Most modern editors allow scrolling the window behind the find dialog so you can look at more of the surrounding context of what was found. That DrScheme doesn't let you do this is annoying.

Just open up a scheme file for editing, type Alt-F, and then try to scroll the editing window.

 True!
 
 Still, what I do is just learn a few keystrokes to make up. Try using
 <menukey>-g to search again and things like that so you don't have to
 have the find dialog open.
 
 My usual sequence:
 
   menukey-f
   ... the search string ...
   <return>
   <esc>
 
   now, poke around and use menukey-g to find the next occurrence.

 I just tried a quick hack in framework/private/frame.ss -- I made the
 dialog be a frame% and it was working as expected.  Should probably be
 easy to do this (the only missing parts are using a style that doesn't
 have window decorations and it should create just one instance and
 just hide/show it).

 Just use the "dock" button is my opinion.

 The problem with that is that it steals a lot of screen space.  A
 floating window is much better since you can put it on the right side
 of the screen where it usually doesn't disturb.

 Just changing the dialog% to frame% (even with some decoration changes)
 breaks user interface designs. If the window looks like a dialog, it
 should behave like one (like now).
 
 Otherwise, it should look like a separate frame and behave like one. In
 this caes, that would probably entail having the search window search
 in more than one frame (ie, be truely independent of the window where
 it was created).
 
 Note that you can show and hide the docked window as you choose, even
 with shortcut keys.
 
 Frankly, tho, this is below my radar screen. What is there is good
 enough, imo.
