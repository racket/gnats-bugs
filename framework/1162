DrScheme frequently produces the error message 

set-stipple in pen%: bitmap is not 8x8: #<object:bitmap%>

After producing that message, it no longer redraws the definitions or
interactions windows until you restart.

There does not seem to be any particular pattern- sometimes it happens,
sometimes it doesn't.

 Jacob,
 
 Thanks for the bug report.
 
 Do you have a black and white display? If so, the fix to that problem
 is to replace plt/collects/icons/paren.xbm with an 8x8 .xmb bitmap.
 Are you using your own installation of DrScheme, or is it one
 associated with a course?

 No, I wasn't using a black-and-white display. The installation I was using
 was the one on Rice's Owlnet. It happened several times on at least two
 different computers and under two different accounts, but both times we
 were running it under WindowMaker, if that helps.

 There are several on Owlnet. Which course? I suspect that it is the
 bitmap I emailed you about; I can replace that bitmap. To be sure of
 the installation you are using, evaluate this:
 
   (current-library-collection-paths)
 
 in drscheme and tell me the result.
 
 Also, if you can tell me exactly what you did, just before you see the
 error message appear, that would help. The best thing is if you can
 reproduce the error; then just send me those instructions.

 Comp 311 is the course; /home/311/bin/drscheme is the executable I was
 running. 
 
 (current-library-collection-paths)
 
 produces
 
 (list "/home/scheme/plt/100/collects")
 
 What I was doing: I believe it always happened on a cursor movement
 (either clicking or using the arrow key) in the definitions window, and I
 think always after checking syntax. Unfortunately, I can't figure out a
 way to reliably reproduce it.

 I replaced the paren bitmap on owlnet in the installation directory he
 is using. That should fix the only call to set-stipple that I found in
 the code (collects/framework/icon.ss)
