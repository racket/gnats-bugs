Shift-delete is supposed to mean "cut" and Shift-insert is
supposed to mean "paste".  Ctrl-insert is supposed to mean "copy".
Shift-delete and Ctrl-insert work but Shift-insert
does not.  I don't know if this is a DrScheme thing or if it's
something that wxWindows (?) handles...

 Hi Amit: how are you doing out in Stanford? It's good to see you're allowed
 to use Scheme :-). Anything special or just checking it out? -- Matthias

        Shift-delete is supposed to mean "cut" and Shift-insert is
        supposed to mean "paste".  Ctrl-insert is supposed to mean "copy".
        Shift-delete and Ctrl-insert work but Shift-insert
        does not.  I don't know if this is a DrScheme thing or if it's
        something that wxWindows (?) handles...
 
 Whether Windows took its cue from CUA or not, Shift-Insert
 is Windows standard for "paste".  We'll fix it before the
 100 release.
