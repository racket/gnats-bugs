 This is a `get-text-from-user' window.

I will add the basic built-in keybindings, but no schememode keybindings

Responsible-Changed-Why:

Oops! I mis-claimed this. I did, however, add these keybindings to the
search and replace window just now. Sorry!

Responsible-Changed-Why:
MrEd 100/40 and up includes `current-text-keymap-initializer',
a parameter for a procedure called to initialize the keymap
of a text-field% (as used in `get-string-from-user').

To close the PR, the frameework needs to set this parameter
to install appropriate bindings (probably using chain-to-keymap).
Note that DrScheme needs to restore the old parameter value
before running a MrEd program.
