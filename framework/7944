linux-other
>Description:
When the new key combination C-c C-l is used, if the insertion point is very close to the beginning of the buffer, an error occurs, which makes the buffer unusable.  The error is as follows (the number varies by position in the buffer):

position-paragraph in text%: expects argument of type <non-negative exact integer>; given -6

 === context ===
/home/samth/sw/plt/collects/framework/private/scheme.ss:885:10: introduce-let-ans method in /home/samth/sw/plt/collects/framework/private/scheme.ss:368:8
call-with-break-parameterization
/home/samth/sw/plt/collects/mred/private/lock.ss:40:2: as-entry
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a drscheme window.
Insert the text "1"
Move the insertion point to the beginning of the buffer.
Press Ctrl-c Ctrl-l.

An error is produced.  Clicking ok does not allow the buffer to be used.
>Fix:
there was a mis-calculation of positions
>Release-Note:
this was a contract violation.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 08 Mar 2006 19:32:33 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.
