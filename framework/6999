Now hit Cmd-Z... the right paren in undone, but the "abc" does not come back.

 I don't quite get the documentation of the first argument to
 begin-edit-sequence, but it appears that passing #t as that argument is
 the cause of this error (unless there's a bug in mred). From what I'm
 seeing in mred, it appears that this flag would only be useful when the
 editor is completely being reset and you want to clear out the undo
 history, but the method doesn't seem to be for that.
 
 I've moved the PR to Matthew so he can verify that nothing's wrong with
 begin-edit-sequence and, if so, I think that Scott has to not pass #t.

Reason>>> This turned out to be easy to fix. 

The bug eas related to paren correction. `get-close-paren' used `insert'
with no position arguments, so it would replace the selection when
trying out different closers, and closers are tried in a non-undoable
edit sequence.

The solution was to simply add a position argument to the `insert'
call, so that `get-close-paren' didn't delete anything when trying
out closers.
