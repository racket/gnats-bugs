>Description:

It would be nice to have a mechanism for the preferences toolkit to fetch
and save it's information to a file that the developer of the application
specifies. Probably this should be a new field in the info.ss file for an
application. Also, the value will have to be communicated to the
preferences toolkit in some fancy way -- probably through dynamic linking.
