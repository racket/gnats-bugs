>Description:
Calling print-to-dc on an instance of text:basic% raises an error:

send: target is not an object: #f for method: get-view

It works for instances of text%, though.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/gui
(require framework)

(define (go editor%)
  (define t (new editor%))
  (define bmp (make-object bitmap% 400 200))
  (define dc (new bitmap-dc% (bitmap bmp)))
  (send t insert "Hello world")
  (send dc clear)
  (send t print-to-dc dc 1)
  bmp)

(go text%) ;; works
(go text:basic%) ;; error
>Fix:
the on-paint method of the text:basic class wasn't checking the result of get-admin.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. It would have been a type error in typed scheme, most likely.

 You will probably have to add some way that the editor is wired up to
 something that can draw it before this will work for all things that
 can go in an editor, eg:
 
      (let* ([f (new frame% [label ""])]
             [t (new text:basic%)]
             [ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t])]
             [bmp (make-object bitmap% 100 40)]
             [dc (new bitmap-dc% (bitmap bmp))])
        (send t insert "Hello world")
        (send t highlight-range 2 5 "orange")
        (send f reflow-container)
        (send dc clear)
        (send t print-to-dc dc 1))
 
 but I've fixed the bug (to be checked in shortly).
