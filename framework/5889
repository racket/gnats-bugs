>Description:
The indentation of application forms in the DrScheme definitions window isn't entirely consistent.  Contrast the two forms below, which are indented as DrScheme would:

(a (c d)
   (e f))

((a b) (c d)
 (e f))

I'd expect that, in the second example, the (e f) would be lined up with the (c d), as they're the first two arguments in the list.
