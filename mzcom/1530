>Description:
If you

  - load MysterX
  - load MzCOM into MysterX
  - load a 2nd MysterX into MzCOM
  - run the MysterX demo in that 2nd MysterX

the Windows events get blocked in the demo,
so the windows freeze up

I tried putting a secondary Windows message 
loop in MzCOM, which makes the windows responsive,
but the COM and HTML event handlers still don't
get called

This is not a critical bug to hold up 102, since
I'm trying fairly pathological code.

>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")
(define mzcom (cocreate-instance-from-progid "MzCOM.MzObj"))
(com-invoke mzcom "Eval" "(load \"plt/collects/mysterx/mxdemo.ss\")")

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: steck
State-Changed-When: Fri Jul  7 13:49:56 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed, tested under DrScheme and MzScheme.
Solution was to add
 
  1) secondary Windows processing loop for msg 0x400
  2) run (sleep) in evaluation loop

Checked NT task list, this strategy doesn't seem to chew cycles
