>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
put this in tmp.ss:

  (define bad-name
    (datum->syntax-object #'here 'unbound-id (list "filename.ss" #f #f #f #f)))

  (compile `(module m mzscheme ,bad-name))

then, run this at the command line:

  [seesen] ~> mzscheme -qr tmp.ss
  compile: unbound variable in module in: unbound-id

I expected to see filename.ss in the error message.

 MzScheme only uses the filename in the error message if there's at
 least a position, so
 
  (define bad-name
     (datum->syntax-object #'here 'unbound-id (list "filename.ss" #f #f 1 #f)))
 
 shows "filename.ss".
 
 Although `compile' does not drop src loc info, marshalling to .zo is
 defined to drop the info. (See the "Compilation" section in the
 MzScheme manual.)

 But, I don't know the position! I only know the filename. Of course, I
 could re-write things to keep track of the entire source location, but
 for my purposes knowing the filename is enough in this case. Why
 shouldn't MzScheme report it?
 
 FWIW, I only called `compile' because compile reported the error. This
 shows up during drscheme's startup if I have a bug in a certain file.

 Ok, I guess it could. Since the "source" field isn't required to be a
 filename, MzScheme was using the position information as an indication
 that the sourec really was a file. But I don't see how it matters.

 I'm not sure what `it' refers to there? 
 
 But, just in case, I'd like to argue that even when the position
 information is numbers, the source file still wouldn't be a file. For
 example, drscheme uses text% objects for sources and still uses numbers
 for positions.

 It doesn't matter that Mzscheme distinguishes "files" from "non-files".
 I'll make the error include the source even when there's no position.
