>Description:
Running under Visual Basic 6.0 or Visual C++ 6.0 whenever the MzCOM reset method is called it waits for a little while then fails.  VB gives the error: "Run-time error '-2417023170 (800706be)':  Automation error, The remote procedure call failed."  In C++ the call appears to time out and return 0x800706be (Remote procedure call failed).  All the other functions appear to work properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
' This vb code causes the crash
' (make sure that the typelib is referenced)
Dim so As MzObj
Set so = New MzObj
    so.Reset

 I've confirmed the bug when running MzCOM under MysterX.  
 
 It's probably a change to the underlying MzScheme C procedure.  I'll see
 if I can fix it.

State-Changed-Why:
    Apparently, subtle interaction with the GC.
    Reordering some code appears to fix the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
    Seems to be something more serious involving embedded MzScheme.

 This bug is fixed in 200.3 MzScheme, which is available via anonymous 
 CVS at
 
  http://www.plt-scheme.org/anoncvs/
 
 That page has instructions for getting code via CVS and pre-built 
 binaries via http.
 
 You can use your old MzCOM binary, I believe, but you'll need the new 
 libmzschxxxxxxx.dll (and maybe the new libmzgcxxxxxxx.dll).
