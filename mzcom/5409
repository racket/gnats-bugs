>Description:
An add of two large integers, e.g.,

    (+ (expt 2 61) (expt 2 61))

produces a segmentation fault on this system.  No such problem is
seen on several other platforms where the same release has been
successfully installed.

Compilations were done with gcc-2.95.3, with the additional
-mieee option to get IEEE 754-conformant behavior.

 Happily, this bug has been fixed for the next release (along with many
 other alpha bugs).
 
 We'll release a new version soon. Meanwhile, if you're in a hurry, the
 code that is available through CVS should work.
 
 Thanks for the bug report,
 Matthew
