>Description:
If I split the interactions window and scroll the two halves to different points, changing focus from one pane to the other (by clicking in the target pane) will frequently cause the "old" pane to scroll itself so that it displays the same area. This behavior limits the utility of split areas.

 The obvious attempts to reproduce this are failing for me. If you could
 send a sequence of steps (preferably starting from a fresh drscheme) to
 demonstrates the problem, that would be quite helpful.
 
 Thanks,

 1. Open the above file
 2. Scroll to the top and click to place the cursor on line 1
 3. View->Split
 4. Use the bottom pane's scroll bar to scroll to line 50 (or far enough
    that none of the code in the top pane is visible)
 5. Click in the bottom pane. The top pane will scroll so that the line
    clicked on in the bottom pane is now visible in the top pane.

 Thanks, Andrew. I'm still not seeing it, despite following your
 directions exactly. 
 
 Still, now that I see your file, I have a clue. Can you just double
 check and see if you remove all test suite boxes (and all other kinds
 of boxes) if the problem still happens?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 The instructions below do not actually work for me.
 
 If you have free time, can you try this on your windows computer?
 
 I suspect that the real problem is the embedded boxes.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 It still happens with file that contains only text. Do note that I am
 seeing this on Windows (2003) only - I have had no such issue on Linux and
 Solaris.

This Windows-specific problem was caused by a different
ordering of on-event and on-focus callbacks. I would
prefer to make the event order the same on all platforms,
but that seems intractable. For now, I just refined the
editor's handling of events to make this one behave.
