It would be nice if the conventional OS X "Don't Save" keyboard shortcut (Command-D) worked to trigger the "Close Anyway" button in the unsaved file confirmation sheet.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open an editor window
Type something in the definitions window
Command-Q to Quit
"The file 'Untitled' is not saved." message pops up. Command-D here should trigger the "Close Anyway" button and finish quitting the app.

 I second this. I've wanted this for a long time.

 How do I do this one? Override a key-catching event at the frame
 level, I guess? Can I make the button blink somehow? (Should I?)

 Seems like anything I do here will have to be redone once
 button-blinking functionality is added (ie, I imagine the Scheme-level
 interface would be a char passed to the button% initializer or
 similar)?
 
 I think I'll move the PR to you. If that seems wrong, pls. move it back.
