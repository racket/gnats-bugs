>Description:
I'm not sure if it is a bug, but in my opinion it is a strange behaviour:

If I use e.g. a choice%, the width of the choice%-Element is always as big as necessary to show all choices.

But if I use a list-box%, the width is always at a minimum-size, which shows only two or three letters, even if the choices are longer.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try following code and have a look at the list-box and choice in the result-window

#lang racket/gui

(define fr (new frame%
                [label "foo"]
                  [height 100]
                  [width 500]))

(define choice-list (list "A" "AB" "ABC" "Foobarbazblablubb"))

(define lis (new list-box%
                 [label "List-Box"]
                 [parent fr]
                 [choices choice-list]

                 [stretchable-width #f]
                 [stretchable-height #f]))

(define ch (new choice%
                [label "Choice"]
                [parent fr]
                [choices choice-list]
                [stretchable-width #f]
                [stretchable-height #f]))

(send fr show #t)
