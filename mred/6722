>Description:
Under Mac OS X 10.3, PLT DrScheme v206 has the annoying behavior that when I set the Mac keyboard to be Dvorak, the regular keystrokes will be appropriately translated (S becomes O &c.), but this suddenly breaks when I use the Ctrl key. I am assuming that somehow the keys with bucky bits are read differently, at a low enough level that the Macintosh keyboard driver is not involved. This would also be annoying for people using other non-US keyboards (azerty, qwertz, &c.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the Mac keyboard driver to Dvorak, and open PLT DrScheme. Type on your keyboard and notice how the keys will be interpreted using the Dvorak keymap. (Alternatively, try French, which is almost like qwerty, but not quite.) Now try to use Ctrl keys, like Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E &c. They will be interpreted according to the Qwerty keymap no matter what.
