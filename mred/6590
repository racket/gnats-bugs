 Do you still have a problem with this?  (IIRC, there is a way to say
 if you want anti-aliasing on or off.)

 I was referring not to antialiasing of the Definitions and Interactions
 windows, but other widgets - mostly primarily the menu bar. The
 font and antialiasing settings for the Defintions and Interactions windows
 seem to have no influence over those other objects.

Reason>>> The v299 code is sufficiently different that this should
be re-reported if it is still a problem.
