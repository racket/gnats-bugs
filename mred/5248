>Description:
(make-object bitmap% xdim ydim) does not generate an
exception, or even fail to return a bitmap% object, when
there is not enough memory left for the bitmap.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; allocate memory until there is not enough left, then:
> (define x (make-object bitmap% 10000 10000))
> x
#<struct:bitmap%>
> (define y (make-object bitmap-dc% x))
. set-bitmap in memory-dc%: bad bitmap: #<struct:bitmap%>

State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 15 18:44:55 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    This is due to an old design design of mimicking an
    underlying C++ library wholesale. In the bitmap% case,
    there's an `ok?' method that returns #f to indicate a bad bitmap.
    
    We're gradually correcting the C-ish interface. And this
    particular item is now near the top of the list.
    
    Thanks,
    Matthew
