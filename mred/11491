>Description:
There's some strange interaction that I see with popup
menus.  The most obvious thing is that every one in a while
I had the menu disappear while I was holding the mouse.  I
can't repeat it consistently, and it tends to happen a
almost always when I popup the right-click menu right after
drr is up.  I *think* that it might be related to a GC,
since the GC icon flashes when it happens.  But it doesn't
happen on every GC, and if I do nothing but pop up these
menus something gets stable and it doesn't happen.

Guessing that something is wrong with GCing or threads or
both, I ran the code below, then right-clicked around the
screen -- and this is even worse -- no pop appears when
it's running (pre-gr2 shows it after a while), and a quick
sequence of right-clicks often results in a bunch of menus
on the screen, waiting to be released one by one.

(All of this done with the simple menu that you get when
clicking on some empty spot.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(thread
 (lambda ()
   (for ([i (in-range 10)])
     (collect-garbage))))
