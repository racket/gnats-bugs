>Description:
	Old expressions can be edited in the MrEd console. Also,
copy-down when the user hits RETURN after an expression is *very*
slow on a large expression because there's no begin-/end-edit-sequence 
around the copy-down.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Start mred.
	Eval "10".
	Move the caret back between the "1" and "0" and type "a".
	You see the "a".
>Fix:
