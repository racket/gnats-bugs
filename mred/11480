>Description:
I cannot get keybindings to work for function keys F16, F17, F18 nor F19.

I have tried defining them in my DrRacket keybindings file and via the MacOS System Preferences dialog (Keyboard --> Keyboard Shortcuts --> Application Shortcuts --> DrRacket.app).  I have tried both these methods separately and together.  I have tried them with and without the Enable keybindings in menus checkbox (DrRacket Preferences dialog --> Editing --> General).

I have tried the function keys with various modifiers (shift, control, alt, and shift-control) as well but they do not work

I _have_ been able to get F13, F14 & F15 working though, via both the above methods.

I have also tried using the functions that work on F13/14/15 on F16/17/18/19 but without success.

I have also noticed that when those keys are defined via the MacOS System Preference keybindings, then when I press one of them, the name of the menu that the key is bound to flashes on the key-press: e.g. if F16 is bound to "Find" in the "Edit" menu, then "Edit" flashes in the menu-bar when I press F16.  Also if I click on one of the menus (but don't select anything) then press one of those keys, then a menu item is selected (but I haven't been able to detect any pattern in the choice).

I have been able to get keybindings on those function keys working with other applications, on my (new) keyboard with numeric keypad.

I am using MacOS X v10.6.5 (10H574) on an intel iMac, and DrRacket v5.0.2.
>How-To-Repeat:
In keybindings file try any/all of:

(kb "f16" "unhide search and toggle focus")
(kb "c:f16" "search forward")
(kb "s:c:f16" "search backward")
(kb "a:f16" "hide-search")
;;;
(kb "c:f17" "replace & search forward")
(kb "s:c:f17" "replace & search backward")
;;;
(kb "f18" "save-file")
(kb "s:f18" "save-file-as")
;;;
(kb "f19" "undo")
(kb "s:f19" "redo")

where kb is defined as:

(define (kb binder function)
  (keybinding
   binder
   (Î» (editor event)
     (send
      (send editor get-keymap)
      call-function
      function
      editor event #t))))

 I think I have found the cause and have a fix:
 
 The Racket file:
 
 	/Applications/Racket_v5.1.1/collects/mred/private/wx/cocoa/keycode.rkt
 
 has a function, map-key-code that has a hash table of key-code to key-symbol mappings, but doesn't include any entries for f16..f19, i.e.:
 
          .
          .
          .
          (113 . f15)
          (#x35 . escape)
          .
          .
          .
 
 
 My solution is to add the missing values, like so:
 
          (113 . f15)
          (106 . f16)
          (64 . f17)
          (79 . f18)
          (80 . f19)
          (#x35 . escape)
 
 then recompile:
 
 	cd /Applications/Racket_v5.1.1/collects/mred/private/wx/cocoa
 	raco make keycode.rkt
 
 and re-launch DrRacket.
 
 It works for me.
 
 
 I obtained the missing key-codes from:
 
 	shortcutrecorder
 	A user interface control to record key combinations. For Mac OS X, uses Cocoa.
 	http://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder/source/browse/trunk/Source/SRKeyCodeTransformer.m?r=46
 
                 .
                 .
                 .
                 @"F15", SRInt(113),
                 @"F16", SRInt(106),
                 @"F17", SRInt(64),
                 @"F18", SRInt(79),
                 @"F19", SRInt(80),
                 .
                 .
                 .
