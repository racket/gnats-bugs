Hi, 

For teaching functionnal programming we use DrScheme 101 (and would like
to stick to this version for the moment, if possible, for bytecode compatibility
reasons). We distribute the Three Disk version of DrScheme 101 to our students
but there is a small configuration problem due to the use we all make
of AZERTY keyboards. So we have to modify a bit the keymap.ss file in
order to make DrScheme fully working. Is it possible to modify this file
in the autoextractable archive? Otherwise, what tool can we use to extract
and recreate this archive?

Thanks in advance for your answer, 

Thank you again for making all this available.

 Paul, are you planning to respond to this one? If so, can you ask what
 the modification to keymap.ss was?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 We use the Wise Installation System to build the installer.
 Unfortunately, it's a rather expensive commercial product, available
 from http://www.wise.com/.  I don't know of a way to modify the existing
 archive, because it's in compressed form.
 
 What you could do is
 
  - install from the existing archive
  - use a 4th floppy to run a batch (.BAT) file that copies a modified
 keymap.ss file
 
 By the way, can you provide us with your modifications to keymap.ss?
 Perhaps we can distribute that in the future.

  Yes, that is a first solution.
 
  Otherwise, would it be possible to install DrScheme on a windows
 station, modify the keymap.ss, build the .zo and then make another
 installation by saving the right files with another installation
 system? (but we would need the listing of all files to be saved and
 installed)... but maybe:
 
 - it is difficult? Are there many files outside of the PLT directory?
 for instance in the system folder?
 - it is forbidden by the DrScheme licence?

  The "modification" is better called "a dirty patch", since it fixes
 only one problem (and maybe rises some others that we have not seen
 during this past year) that we encountered with azerty keyboards when
 trying to type some: \ character (as in #\a) in the DrScheme
 window. 
 
 The dirty patch (I am not the author of this one :-)  is to comment the
 line 768 of keymap.ss: 
 
 (map-meta "\\" "remove-space")
 
 
 Thank you for your help,
 
 
 Thomas

 All the files are in the PLT directory, except the libmred*.dll,
 libmzsch*.dll, and libmzgc*.dll files (the *'s represent version
 numbers), which are in the System32 (NT/2000/XP) or System (9x/Me)
 directories.  The Wise installer also adds some registry entries, so
 that .ss and .scm files are associated with DrScheme.  The installer
 also creates the Start menu shortcuts.
 
 You could certainly build a new distribution with your changes.
 
 I think the following provision of the LGPL applies to your changes:
 
   # b)  You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
 which you probably a good idea, anyway.
