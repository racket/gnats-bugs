>Description:
Software version is 299.400, but I also tried 299.200.
Distro is Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 ("Sarge").

As the subject says, I can't run drscheme, mred or help-desk on
this system.  All of these programs crash with an error message
like:

   X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
     Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
     Resource id in failed request:  0xc00139
     Serial number of failed request:  810
     Current serial number in output stream:  821

"Resource id" and "serial number" are different for different programs,
but "opcode" is always the same.

But: I can run MrEd scripts with "mred -z -qr ...".  Also DrScheme
displays its first four dialogs ("starting progress", "welcome",
"check for update" and "language selection"); it's just after I click
on "finish" in the "language selection" that it crashes.

The problem happens with the Debian binaries from plt-scheme.org as
well as with self-compiled binaries.  XFree version is 4.3.0 and I'm
not doing anything fancy with the server :-).

The programs from the 209 series run on the same computer without a
glitch.

Please let me know if you need more info to track down this bug.

Thanks.

 This was indeed one of the first things I tried.  It didn't
 solved the problem for me though.

 Same here.

 I installed drscheme on my current Gentoo Linux system and had
 this problem on starting DrScheme (version 301).
 
 A trace suggested the problem might be associated with one of my
 user's X configuration files, so I tried blanking out parts and
 isolated the problem to a line in my "~/.Xdefaults" which said:
 
   *beNiceToColormap:    True
 
 I commented this out and I'm now able to run DrScheme and
 help-desk without problems.  I'm not sure why this works, but
 I'll try to figure that out.  Hope this helps.
 
 Alan

 This helps a lot. I see that the menu widget is using this resource ---
 and probably nothing else --- which explains why DrScheme crashes when
 it does.
 
 I'll fix it.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
