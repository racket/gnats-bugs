>Description:
The docs claim that editor-canvas has an on-scroll method, but the code seems to differ. (I'm pretty sure this is a docs bug, but not positive.)

  > (class editor-canvas%
      (inherit get-editor)
      (define/override (on-scroll) (void))
      (super-new))
  class*: superclass does not provide an expected method
  for override: on-scroll for class: ...eshow/tool.ss:350:8>:72:2

Note also that the docs claim that canvas<%> has an on-scroll, but:

  > (memq 'on-scroll (interface->method-names canvas<%>))
