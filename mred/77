Freebsd, new-world, 49s1, default prefs.

>Description:
	
Selecting Cancel from Preferences shakes the row of buttons.
This happens even if the drscheme window and the preferences
window have no overlap.  This doesn't happen with OK. 

And while we're on the subject of preferences, it takes a long
time for the preferences window to appear and there is no watch
cursor.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
Start drscheme.
Select Edit -> Preferences.
Select Cancel.
The row of buttons shakes.

State-Changed-Why:

The button row shakes, becuase the container classes think it needs to be
updated. The container classes think it needs to be updated becuase you
(potentially) changed what the library is, becuase cancel is implemented by
checking pointing all preferences and then restoreing them. So, when you
restore the preferences the library changes (probably to the same thing)
and since the preferences abstractino doesn't include equality, it shakes.

I will turn on a watch cursor.

State-Changed-Why: watch cursor worse than anticipated

Well, it turns out that watch cursor is already on, but when running on nw
and displaying somewhere else the watch cursor doesn't show up
immediately. When running on europa (displaying either on aten, or nw) the
watch cursor shows up fine. This suggests that there is some problem with
the thread that turns the watch cursor on not getting enough time under
bsd. This uses the mred:delay-action procedure to create the thread to turn
on the watch cursor.

State-Changed-Why:

This is one of many places where MzScheme's threads are not scheduled
very well. Low-level operations that take a relatively long time (for
example, resizing a graphical object) should count for more against
the current thread's "fuel", but it doesn't right now. Want more
examples? Load a bitmap, save an editor file, or scroll an editor
buffer.

This is on the version 50 todo list for MrEd. Probably the solution
involves looking at an actual clock after calling certain primitive
procedures.
