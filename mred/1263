>Description:
Subject says all:
XFree86 on most European keyboards uses dead keys
to generate accents.  This doesn't work:  MrEd
waits for the next key, but sees an unaccented
character.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type a dead key (say, tilde on a German keyboard),
followed by another character (say space).  You'll
get the unaccented character (say space).

Unable to make any sense of the X documentation, I eventually
started searching the web for a clearer explanation. All I
found was lots of other people complaining about how bad the
docs were. :)

Finally, I just downloaded the Emacs source code and copied its
strategy.
