>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
;; problem 1:
;; evaluate following code.
;; select the inner text, click "replace" and get an error that get-extent should not receive #f for a dc.

;; problem 2:
;; evaluate the following code.
;; make the window bigger and set the focus to the inner text% and stop giving mred input.
;; output will continue, without stopping.

;; problem 3:
;; remove the for-each expression. Then, the boxes are filled (sometimes) with negative numbers,
;; and super-get-extent complains
