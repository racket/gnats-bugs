I followed the install instructions, and when I'm ready to run Dr. Scheme, it wont.

I am running Mandrake 6.0 Linux, using the 2.2.9 Kernel.  Mandrake is 99%
compatible with Red Hat.

However, it will not run.

I try to click on the icon in X-Windows, and nothing happens.
I try to ./DrScheme, and it outputs one line "Segmentation Fault".

 This problem is addressed on the DrScheme download page
 for Linux:
 
   WARNING: The Linux binary was compiled with a stock RedHat 5.2 
   distribution. With other varieties of Linux (Debian, or other 
   versions of Red Hat, for example), you may have difficulties 
   due to library incompatibilities. If you experience crashes, 
   especially when opening Help Desk, try downloading and compiling 
   source code instead. Source code is available through the DrScheme 
   download page. 
 
 Go to http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/ and 
 download the "Unix/X sources" version of DrScheme.  Then
 recompile MzScheme and MrEd.  This should fix your problem.
