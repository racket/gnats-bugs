I sent this to Matthew earlier but then thought he might not be
involved in maintaining DrScheme any longer so I came here.

I have a Debian GNU/Linux potato system and tried compiling MrEd
(mzscheme compiled fine) with GCC 2.95 which was released a few days
ago. The compilation fails with these 3 error (there may be more but
I think it gave up after 3). There may be some switch I can use to subvert this behavior but I haven't found it yet.

Utilities/Path.cc: In function `char * wxExpandPath(char *, const char *)':
Utilities/Path.cc:120: ANSI C++ forbids declaration `braces' with no type
make[3]: *** [Utilities/objects/sys/Path.o] Error 1

Windows/Frame.cc: In method `void wxFrame::SetStatusText(char *, int = 0)':
Windows/Frame.cc:379: passing `const char *' as argument 1 of `wxMessage::SetLabel(char *)' discards qualifiers
make[3]: *** [Windows/objects/sys/Frame.o] Error 1

Windows/RadioBox.cc: In method `int wxRadioBox::Create(wxPanel *, void (*)(wxObject &, wxCommandEvent &), char *, int = -1, int = -1, int = -1, int = -1, int = 0, wxBitmap ** = 0, int = 0, long int = 0, char * = "radioBox")':
Windows/RadioBox.cc:262: assignment to `void *' from `const char *' discards qualifiers
Windows/RadioBox.cc: In method `wxRadioBox::~wxRadioBox()':
Windows/RadioBox.cc:322: warning: `void *' is not a pointer-to-object type

 I don't have GCC 2.95 installed anywhere, yet, but I fixed those three
 problems for the final version 100 bundle. Maybe we'll be lucky and
 that's all. :)
