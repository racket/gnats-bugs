>Description:
On Macs, there are 3rd-party apps like Zooom/2 and Mondomouse that let you move and resize windows without having to touch the title bar or small hot bottom-right corner of a window.

I just started using Zooom/2, and noticed it works with most Mac apps just fine.  However with DrScheme, I can only move a window with Zooom/2; I can't resize it.

I hear the Zooom/2 developer is very responsive, so my best guess is he might know right off the bat what the problem is.  I'll try contacting him, but in the meantime I thought I'd let you know.

 As far as I'm concerned, this bug can be closed.  I recently updated  
 to version 4.2.1.8-svn11sep2009 [3m] and the problem has gone away.

 Sorry to bother you.  I spoke too soon.  The bug reappeared.   
 Sometimes the window doesn't resize, especially if the window recently  
 became large.  When resizing works, the outer frame resizes but the  
 inner frames do not adapt to the size of the outer frame the way they  
 do when the lower-right-corner resize-square is dragged.  For example,  
 the info area below the Interactions Pane can become very large (and  
 somewhat useless).
 
 Since this only affects people who use apps like Zooom/2 that use the  
 resize API, this probably remains a low priority bug, a curiosity.
