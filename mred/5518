>Description:
after executing some graphics commands, MrEd.exe will periodically take 100% of my CPU for 15-20 seconds at a time.  Other applications seem to play well around it, but all of my Dr.Scheme windows are frozen for the duration.  I thought I saw that this was fixed in alpha9 or 10, but I still see the problem in 19.
>How-To-Repeat:
the program I'm running loads some bitmaps (using bitmap%) from files and draws them to a frame% with an associated canvas% object.  I can provide the source if you would like.

 Is DrScheme collecting garbage during the freeze (with the recycle icon
 showing)? Or does it happen just after a garbage collection?

 I'll take you up on that.
 
 Thanks,

State-Changed-Why:
    color% objects were finalized internally, and they
    don't need it. The result was disasterous for
    David's program, which allocated color% objects in
    a loop.
    
    Fixed for v203.
