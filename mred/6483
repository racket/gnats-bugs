>Description:
Printing a file in DrScheme with images doesn't
work under Windows XP Pro printing to a HP Laster
Jet 4050 (presumably networked).

Apparently, the text shows up, but the images are missing.

Reported by: Li MA <marlee@midway.uchicago.edu>

More from Li Ma:

I tried on my Brother printer at home, and it worked! It's so strange. I
printed two copies on the HP-4050TN printer. Neither of them has the
images. Anyways, just want to let you know that at home, I am using
Windows XP Home Edition, and my printer is a Brother HL1440.

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 00:58:01 -0500
Reason: mred.  -- Also see PR6466, which sounds awfully similar

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:09 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
