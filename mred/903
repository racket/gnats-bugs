>Description:
When a bitmap% object is created with a filename initializer, it attempts
to open and read an image from the file. When the file exists, but does
not contain an image that mred can parse, the file is not closed.

[Matthew -- this is the problem with help desk that we discussed]
>How-To-Repeat:
This will only reproduce on the mac, since delete-file is a platform-specific operation. On the mac, files cannot be delted when they are still
open. There is no such restriction on other platforms.

;; on my machine, this file contained a jpg from my web page.
(define new-file "Cupertino:Desktop Folder:tmp.jpg")
(define b (make-object bitmap% new-file))
(delete-file new-file)

delete-file: cannot delete file: "Cupertino:Desktop Folder:tmp.jpg"

 Worse: even if it sucessfully reads a `PICT' file, it leaves the file
 open.
 
 I commited and exp-tagged a (probable) fix. Can you try it? The new
 file is plt:src:wxmac:src:mac:wx_gdi.cc.

 I tried the new source code and it does not seem to fix the problem.

 I had fixed some code that was #ifdef'ed out. (The image-loading code
 we inhereted from wxWindows is a mess.)
 
 I think I've now fixed the code that is actually called (the same code
 copied into a different file!). The newly updated files are in
 plt/src:wxmac:utils:image:src.
