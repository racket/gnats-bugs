>Description:
When typing in the filename field of the open/save dialog box, if a user presses tab, DrScheme behaves oddly. It simultaneously tab-completes the filename field, but also advances the focused field in the dialog box.

Please pick one. (Preferably tab completion, since I can only people people would use it more often than they'd want to focus the "filter" field. :-} )

 The tab key always advances the focus, it does not trigger completion.
 However, if there is a single completion, it gets filled in after a
 short delay -- and you're probably confusing this with hitting tab.

 (That would be a mistake -- it would make it a dialog that requires
 using the mouse to navigate.)

 (Actually, it looks like completion happens to the longest prefix of all
 files that have your input as a prefix, like tab in a shell. So, in a
 directory with "aa1" and "aa2", "a" will complete to "aa".)

 True. Tab (over delay) does have a use though, as the current
 delay-completion leaves the added text selected. Perhaps control-tab for
 "force immediate completion, and set insertion point to end of field"
 would be useful? (Or bind that behavior to tab and use control-tab to
 advance focus for that field.)

 Yes, I forgot about that.

 This is an important feature.  Without that, if you have a file called
 "foo.scm" and you type slow enough, you can end up with
 "foo.scmo.scm".  In addition, it makes it easy to undo the completion
 by deleting it (and after that it will not autocomplete the same
 prefix back).

 S-right forces immediate completion -- and if you just release the
 shift, you get the point at the end.

 Yes; for delay-completion, it's vital.

 (Nice touch.)

 Oh, cool.
