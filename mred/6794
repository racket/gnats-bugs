>Description:
PLT Installer crashes whith the following error while trying to install Dr. Scheme:
"The instruction at ox100c420e" referenced memeory at ox00000014". The memory could not be read."

It installs everything but Dr.Scheme and the help desk.  Runnign finishInstall.exe results in the same error.

I have tried this on two different machines both running windows 2000, and a machine running windows 2000 server with the same result.  I am logged in as administrator and have all rights on all three machines.

>How-To-Repeat:
1. download v206p1 from the dr. scheme site
2. run the installer, and default the location

 This problem is known, although we didn't manage to find what is the
 source so there is no solution.  One thing that was reported to work
 is to bring your network connection down on some way (either stop the
 network services or disconnect the machine).
