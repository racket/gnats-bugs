>Description:

the focus for some frontmost frames does not appear until some event goes
to the frame. That is, when a frame is created and the focus should be in a 
editor canvas in the frame, the caret does not appear until the frame is
hidden and shown again, or until the frame's title bar is clicked on.

>How-To-Repeat:

Unfortuately, I could not reproduce this simply. However, load the
framework, and evaluate:

  (let* ((% (class-asi
              frame:text-info%
              (override
                (get-editor%
                  (lambda ()
                    (text:info-mixin (editor:info-mixin text:searching%)))))))
         (f (make-object % "test text")))
    (send f show #t))

to see the problem.

If it is possible that this is a bug in the framework, please let me know
how it could be and I will work on it myself. AFAIK, it cannot be a bug in
the framework.

Fixed. (We think.) The problem appears to have been a race in the
Widget set between setting the focus and setting the visible flag.
The visible flag is no longer checked.
