Freebsd, nw, 49s1, default prefs.

>Description:
	
Execute fails to create a new output port for each execution.

With prefs set to "keep execution history", this means that all of
the output for several executes goes to the same box.
With prefs set to "don't keep execution history", this means that
I see the output for the first run, but not later runs.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
Start drscheme.
Set prefs to "don't keep execution history."
Enter (printf "Hello, world~n")
Execute, then execute again.
I only get the output for the first run.
