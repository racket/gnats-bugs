>Description:
Vertical drag moves on canvas scrollbars are not properly
reported to the on-scroll method.

See below for details on reproducing the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define dummy-canvas% 
  (class canvas%
    (define/override on-scroll
      (lambda (s-e)
        (display (send s-e get-direction)) (display " ")
        (display (send s-e get-event-type)) (display " ")
        (display (send s-e get-position)) (newline)))
    (super-instantiate () (style '(hscroll vscroll)))
    (send this init-manual-scrollbars 1000 1000 100 100 0 0)))

(define f (make-object frame% "Testing" #f 256 256))
(define c (make-object dummy-canvas% f))
(send f show #t)

;; Test out all different types of scrolling events; the vertical
;; dragging moves are incorrectly reported.
