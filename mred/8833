>Description:
ESC w didn't clear text selection
Cmd-C (Copy) didn't either
>How-To-Repeat:
I was trying to be a good boy and use templates in my design, e.g.:

;(cond [(circInfo? x) (... (circInfo-radius x) ... (circInfo-color x) ...)]
;      [(rectInfo? x) (... (rectInfo-width x) ... (rectInfo-height x) ... (rectInfo-color x))])

I put the cursor on the first semicolon, ESC SPC to set mark, C-n twice to select those lines.  Then I typed ESC w to copy the lines.  In Emacs, the blue highlight would then have gone away, but sometimes (it was intermittent), the highlight stayed on, so that any cursor movement merely extended the selection further.  I wanted to copy those lines and yank them somewhere else, delete the semicolons and make use of the template.

 Apparently yet another place we don't mimic Emacs exactly (or a place
 where we used to, but Emacs changed in the meantime).
 
 Anyways, in DrScheme, you'd have to hit esc-space again to turn off
 that mode (note the words that appear at the bottom of the drs window
 to tell you you're in the selection-extending mode, not ordinary
 editing mode).
 
 Alternatively, you can just type
 
   shift-down
   shift-down
 
 to get the same selection without having to mess with esc-space and
 modality in the editor.
