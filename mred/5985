>Description:
I'm trying to help my son learn scheme.  His teacher is not helping him so I have to.  I have the help window open, and he is working on problem 9.5.5.  We try and execute the guess-with-gui-list function with the guess.ss teach pack loaded.  Sometimes when I click execute, drscheme just disappears with no error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
open up code for chapter 9.  load 'guess.ss' teach pack.  add (guess-with-gui-list 5 check-guess-for-list).  click execute and program just goes away.

 Sorry for the delayed response.
 
 There is a pervasive bug in MrEd (the graphical toolkit used to build
 DrScheme) v202 and earlier which caused crashes under Windows in certain
 situations.
 
 I'm running the soon-to-be-released v203, and tried the scenario you
 described.  No crash under Windows 2000.
 
 I expect v203 to be released within the next few days.
