>Description:
Select a bunch of text in a definitions pane and click "insert comment box" from the "Special" menu".  The selected text is replaced by an empty comment box.  This action cannot be undone.  Since this action replaces the selection, it should be undoable.

The other items in the Special... menu act similarly.

 The problem is actually that the "undo" of the comment box is not
 connected to he "undo" of the enclosing editor. If you move the
 keyboard focus outside the nested box, then undo restores the deleted
 text.
 
 It would be better, I think, to chain all the undos together within a
 display.
