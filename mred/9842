 this is something Matthew and I discussed recently. It is really
 annoying on an underpowered machine. :)

 Yes -- I've seen on on a student's laptop, that was running slow to
 save on power consumption.  On my machine it is barely visible, and
 through vnc (which is how I do 99% of my work) it isn't visible at all
 (probably because the network is slower than the drawing to the point
 that it never passes along that extra frame).

 It isn't visible on my at all either. I think it takes a REALLY slow
 machine or X to see it.

 The machine that had the flicker was not slow enough to be labeled
 "REALLY" slow.  In fact, one thing that was still running pretty fast
 was the video -- the guy used one of these 3d desktop things without a
 problem.

 You said in your previous message that it was running slow for power
 consumption, I thought?

 It was running at 800mhz, still fast enough to be able to use drscheme
 conveniently.
