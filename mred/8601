>Description:
The program below should have a mostly grey window, instead it has a mostly white window. Clicking the button replaces the pasteboard with a text and then the window becomes mostly grey.

(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 400] [height 400]))
(define pb (new pasteboard%))
(define c (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor pb]))
(send c set-canvas-background (make-object color% 100 100 100))
(define b (new button% [label "button"][parent f] [callback (Î» x (send c set-editor (new text%)))]))
(send f show #t)
