>Description:
On Windows Vista Ultimate x64, the Open dialog defaults to the PLT directory under Program Files instead of using SHGetFolderPath (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms647764.aspx) with a fallback of SHGetSpecialFolderPath (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms647816.aspx).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start Dr. Scheme from its shortcut.
2. Click File > Open.

The user's My Documents should be displayed instead of Dr. Scheme's installation directory.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 03:17:18 -0400
Reason>>> either mred, or maybe drscheme (or both)



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:25 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
