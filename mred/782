>Description:
according to the docs, set-scrollbars accepts 8 arguments.
But according to the implementation, it needs 9. Also, it says
"procedure set-scrollbars" instead of "method of class c%
set-scrollbars"

Presumably the test suite doesn't check for erroneous
error messages :)
>How-To-Repeat:
procedure set-scrollbars: expects 9 arguments, given 8: 1 16.0 547.0 269 50 20 0 269
