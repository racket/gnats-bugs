>Description:
The file dialog for DrScheme's "Set Library To..." menu item
gives a file filter as the prompt at the top left of the
dialog.

Probably, it's calling get-file with a parent argument
first instead of last.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Select "Set Library To..."
 [Do not choose "Open..." first! See next PR]
