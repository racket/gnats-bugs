>Description:
DrScheme crashes after a system call. The command is being executed succesfully as I can see when using plt-r6rs in the console (mspaint started and #t was written to the console after quitting mspaint). I never had this problem with 4.1.4. 
>How-To-Repeat:
#!r6rs

(import (rnrs)
        (only (scheme system) system))

(define cmd "\"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\mspaint.exe\" C:\\Users\\stb\\Documents\\CarneadesTemp\\carneades-1.png")

(write (system cmd))
