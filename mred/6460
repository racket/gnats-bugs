>Description:
The following error message appears when trying to run DrScheme on
Rice's Owlnet via ssh from Rice's CSNet.

ld.so.1: /home/scheme/plt/205/bin/mred-real: fatal: relocation error: file /home/scheme/plt/205/bin/mred-real: symbol XkbSetDetectableAutoRepeat: referenced symbol not found
>How-To-Repeat:
Log in to CSNet machine.
ssh to Owlnet Solaris 2.6 server, e.g., long-eared.cs.rice.edu.
drscheme


Note that this works correctly if you ssh to an Owlnet Solaris 2.8 server,
e.g., forest.owlnet.rice.edu.

Reason>>> mred bug, there was no reply, so maybe it is fine to close 
it.  Moving to Matthew in case it rings some bells.

 Sorry about the slow reply.  I haven't needed to use DrScheme in over
 a year now.
 
 Indeed.  It was compiled for Solaris 2.8, but I was running on
 Solaris 2.6.
