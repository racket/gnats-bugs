>Description:
On linux,

* tabbed dialogs are mostly impossible to navigate without the mouse: I sometimes
  can get C-pageup/pagedown to work when the focus is on some gui element, but
  after a tab is switched it doesn't work again until the focus moves explicitly
  (eg, with tab) to some gui widget.

* (It looks like on the "manage" dialog of the handin client the focus never reaches
  the tabs -- I'd expect that to always be possible.)

* C-tab doesn't work at all, it's always treated as just a tab.

* Multiple tabs => navigation disaster.
