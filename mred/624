 Printing from my DrS 51 at home is fine as far as size is concerned. 
 It comes out too large, but that can easily be fixed with the print
 dialogue. 
 
 But I have a different problem: the margins seem to be fixed to 60 or 
 so columns, so it inserts a line break at odd places and things don't 
 look good. I will bring it in tomorrow. -- Matthias

 This is actually in the FAQ; it's a long-time problem that I haven't
 been able to fix.
 
 Does you prtiner dialog have a "Properties" button that lets you
 change the font size?

 It's fixed to a particular margin on your paper, rather than a number
 of columns. If your printer dialog has a "Properties" button, you
 might be able to make the font slightly smaller, fitting more on a
 page. (See the DrScheme FAQ.)
 
 The margin is not actually hardwired. You can adjust it via
 wx:get-media-print-margin and wx:set-media-print-margin.  (This should
 be changed to a parameter in a later MrEd.) The printer driver may add
 an additional margin, which is hopefully configureable via a
 "Properties" dialog.

 Did that and reported that! It doesn't work.

 I didn't find a margin property in my HP printer dialogue, which was my
 first instinct ...
