>Description:
Open a web browser window, and drag an image across over to DrScheme's scroll widget on the right hand side.  DrScheme should immediately crash with an internal segmentation fault:

dyoo@mithril:~/local/plt$ bin/drscheme 
Seg fault (internal error) at 0x4
Aborted


Here is a back-trace from gdb:

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:36 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
