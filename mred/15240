>Description:
Using -singleInstance is completely broken now.  Running DrR for the
first time with the flag works fine, but then trying to open new files
fails with a detailed error message and a core dump, pasted below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Gdk: The program 'drracket' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 130 error_code 3 request_code 20 (core protocol) minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment
   variable to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

Reason>>> Fixed by d28ab7105887 in the racket/gui repo.

The problem was that libunique doesn't work with GTK+3. The
solution is to use the unique-instance support provided by
GTK+3 (which means that Racket no longer relies on libunique
for `-singleInstance` when GTK+3 is available).
