Running Setup-PLT seems to have no effect;
it runs for about two seconds and quits. After this
there is no DrScheme application available.

Have I missed something?

(BTW, I've successfully installed the Linux version (from source),
the Mac binary distribution -- using my wife's old iBook has
me flummoxed!

Many thanks,

 This is a known bug.  Please try the following workaround, and please 
 let us know whether it works.
 
 1) In the PLT window, locate and double-click on the MrEd application.
 2) After it starts up, quit.
 3) Now double-click on Setup PLT.
 
 Again, please let us know whether it works for you.

 Thanks John -- but `no dice'.
 
 Trying to run MrEd results in a:
 
 The application MrEd could not be opened
 because
 "CarbonLib--GetPortBitMapForCopyBits"
 could not be found.
 
 error.
 
 Hmmmm...I'm just guessing here, but could some `#ifdef's be 
 a little off? ;-)
 
 Many thanks,

 Hmm, this is the first time I've heard about this one.  Do you have 
 CarbonLib installed? As distributed, DrScheme 202 depends on CarbonLib.

 No, thank _you_... we should check to see what version of CarbonLib is 
 installed, obviously.

 John:
 
 Thanks again. 
 Apparently, it *really* wanted CarbonLib 1.1.1 -- or, at least, 
 1.0 was not good enough. Fortunately I had one around....
 
 Many, many thanks!!!

 John:
 
 Well, perhaps not quite so fast ;-(
 
 DrScheme has been generated, gets most of the way through its
 initialization screen...and silently dies :(
 
 I'm now wondering if it's some kind of version mismatch (a newer
 extension against an older system -- dunno, my Mac system-level
 knowledge is sketchy)...
 
 Any suggestions?
 
 Thanks again,

 I'm fresh out.  When you say "silently dies," do you mean that no error 
 window at all pops up?  In other words, from the standpoint of the OS, 
 it's terminating successfully?
