>Description:
In the method set-search-direction of searchable-canvas%,
there is a comparison (=) of the formal x to 1.  

In the same file, in a private member dir-radio, there is a call to that method which passes either 'forward or 'backward.  Hence the
comparison causes a run-time error.  I'm not sure that
that call is responsible for the error I saw.

(Note: Also in dir-radio, I see a call to get-command-int,
which I believe is a 53 hangover.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a frame:searchable%, and pick Edit | Find.
