>Description:
Note, I'm talking about the Windows version 102.  

Ctrl-C, V, X, etc.
often don't work -- pressing them has no apparent effect.  I've
had it happen with all three of those keys.  It seems to be
something environmental.  If it doesn't work the first time,
pressing repeatedly won't help, but sometimes while it won't 
work in one window it will work in another, leading to the most
annoying instantiation of this problem:  Copy from one window,
paste into another, and you end up pasting something from a 
previous copy, since the copy didn't work but the paste did.
Not exactly earth-shattering, but I thought you should know.
>How-To-Repeat:
Can't help much there.  Edit a project with several windows open
(I've often got five editing windows going simultaneously).

 Thanks for the bug report. We have fixed this in version 103, due to be
