 What does esc do in dialogs? can-close/on-close/show #f?

State-Changed-Why:

fixed, not yet released, added to the test suite. Note that I only test
cancelling the dialog; DrScheme is not responsible for esc acutally meaning 
cancel. I assume that is covered by Matthew's test suite and testing.

State-Changed-Why:

I move this to Matthew since I can only verify half of the problem has been 
fixed. Making sure that esc actually runs on-close/can-close/show #f is out 
of my baliwick (how is that spelled, anyways?).

State-Changed-When: Tue Mar  9 16:17:54 1999
State-Changed-Why:
ESC definitely calls on-close/can-close/show #f.
