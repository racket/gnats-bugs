>Description:
In previous versions of DrScheme, the modal dialogue box prompting the user when closing a file with unsaved changes could be navigated with the tab key to focus the "Don't Save" button, which could then be pressed with the space bar. This style of interaction seems to no longer function, at least on Mac OS X, requiring mouse interaction to click the "Don't Save" button. I for one would appreciate a return of the prior functionality that allowed for keyboard-only control.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new tab, edit the definitions window, close the window, attempt to navigate the confirmation dialogue with the keyboard.

 (I assume that you have the global Mac preference enabled.)
 
 It still works, but there's some bug that I haven't been able to pin
 down so far (and I'm not sure that it isn't an OS/Carbon bug). The bug
 causes keyboard actions to not "wake up" the DrScheme process
 sometimes. When that happens, if you press the key you want and then
 move the mouse, then the key does what it should.
 
 I would really like to fix this bug, but I haven't made any progress on
 it for months, so I can't predict when it will be fixed. My only real
 plan is to try re-implementing all of MrEd (on Cocoa), in which case
 this problem would be fixed along the way.
