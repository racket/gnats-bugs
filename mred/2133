>Description:
the clickbacks have some button-like behavior, where
they highlight the clickback region when the button is
down and over the clickback region and when the
button is released they only invoke the clickback
if the mouse was over the clickback region.

The only problem is that the test of "is the mouse
over the clickback region" appears to be "is the
mouse over any clickback region".
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 300 300))
(define t (make-object text%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send t insert "abc\n   \ndef\n")
(send t set-clickback 0 3 (lambda x (display "first\n")))
(send t set-clickback 8 11 (lambda x (display "second\n")))
(send f show #t)

;; evaluate above code.
;; click (don't release) on abc
;; move the mouse cursor over top of the
;;   blank line and see the highlight go away
;; move the mouse cursor over top of the
;;   def line and see the highlight (on abc)
;;   re-appear
