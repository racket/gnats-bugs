>Description:
On Windows, the most significant bit in each byte is the first
from the left, and so on.

On Linux, the least significant bit in each byte is the first 
from the left, and so on.

It seems to me that the implied translation string->bitmap% 
really ought to be portable.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define bits "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+")
(define bm (make-object bitmap% bits 8 8))
; ... create some relevant device context dc, then ...
(send dc draw-bitmap bm 0 0 'solid)
; ... and notice the resulting pattern is platform dependent
