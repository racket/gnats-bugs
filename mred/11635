>Description:
Using the arrow keys to navigate in the definitions window is rather frustrating, as each key stroke results in the cursor moving twice rather than once.

E.g., pressing the up arrow results in the cursor moving up two lines.  (Same for left, down, and right.)

The same behavior can also be observed in the interactions window, and for that matter right here in the bug-report form.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type a few lines in the definitions window.

2. Use the arrow keys (up/down/left/right)to navigate, observe the described behavior.

 I don't see this behavior, and I wonder whether it has something to do
 with input methods. Are you using something other than the "U.S."
 keyboard input mode?
 
 In any case, I just (last night) changed some details of keyboard
 handling under Mac OS. Does the latest version behave any differently
 for you?
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew

 Nope, just the standard U.S. keyboard settings as far as I can tell.

 Just downloaded the current nightly -- no change, same behavior  
 observed.
 
 Also, a few more notes in case it's helpful:
 
 * I observe this behavior in 5.09.66 (both the most recent nightly and  
 the prior nightly).  I do _not_ observe this behavior in 5.02.
 
 * ctrl-p and ctrl-n behave properly, i.e. moving up and down a single  
 line at a time.
 
 Please let me know if there's more info I can provide that would be  
 helpful.
 
 Best regards,
 Ben

 Can you run
 
  racket -l tests/gracket/showkey
 
 from a command line, press the up-arrow key, quit with Cmd-Q, and send
 me the output that goes to the terminal?
 
 If you don't move the mouse, the output should look something like
 this:
 
  1 KEY: up
    rel-code: down
    other-codes: (#f "\uF700" = ASCII 63232 #f #f)
    mods:
  2 KEY: release
    rel-code: up
    other-codes: (#f "\uF700" = ASCII 63232 #f #f)
    mods:
 
 But I expect to see more events if the arrow-key event is getting
 duplicated at a fairly low level of event handling.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 And indeed, I do get something different -- two up's, no release.
 
 % bin/racket -l tests/gracket/showkey
 1 KEY: up
    rel-code: down
    other-codes: (#f "\uF700" = ASCII 63232 #f #f)
    mods:
 2 KEY: up
    rel-code: down
    other-codes: (#f "\uF700" = ASCII 63232 #f #f)
    mods:
 
 Thanks for your continued efforts!

 In "plt/collects/mred/private/wx/cocoa/window.rkt", at line 280,
 there's
 
        (when down?
          ;; Calling `interpretKeyEvents:' allows key combinations to be
          ....)
 
 What happens if you replace the `down?' with `#f' (so that
 `interpretKeyEvents:' is not used)? Does that change the key events
 reported in the "showkey" test or the way the arrow keys work in
 DrRacket?
