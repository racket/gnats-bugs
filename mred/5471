windows-2000
>Description:
In Help Desk, scrolling a document rapidly (so as to cause
lag between display and cursor) causes the cursor to lose
track of its shape.  It turns into an I-beam, and it takes
a mouse click to restore its true shape.  Worse, mousing
over the little box in the scroll-bar makes the scrolling
continue (only in the direction in which it was going
earlier).
>How-To-Repeat:
Select a large document like the net collection doc.
Go to someplace near the beginning.
Put the cursor in the lower half of the scroll bar.
Now, hold the mouse down for a few seconds.
The screen starts to scroll rapidly.
Along the way, the cursor turns into an I-bar.
After that, moving the cursor out of the scroll bar
has no effect.  When you move it back over the indicator
in the scroll bar, the window scrolls a bit more.
You have to click outside the region for it to return
to normal.
