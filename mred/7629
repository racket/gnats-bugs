>Description:
I encountered several problems when compiling the plt-299.200 source code under linux (gcc 3.0.4).

Some I could fix (perhaps they are worthwhile mentioning for others), but the last error when running "make install" related to servlet-primitives.ss in web-server was impossible to resolve.

Please let me know how to get rid of the last error concerning
compiling servlet-primitives.ss which results in a complaint
that identifiers are already imported.

Thanx very much!
Best, Mike
>How-To-Repeat:
running make (resolved):
------------------------

1) CODESET in ./mzscheme/src/string.c:2146 has to be "CODESET",
   otherwise I obtain a compile error.

2) #include "widgets.h" and #include "wx.h"
   in various *.cc files in the directories

   ./wxxt/src/Windows/ ./wxxt/src/Application
   ./wxxt/src/Misc ./wxxt/src/Utilities

   have to have an absolute path in order not to mix up with
   the system-wide widgets.h and wx.h installed on my Linux box.


running make install (UNRESOLVED):
----------------------------------

1) The following error occurs

setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for Web Server (/work/src/plt/collects/web-server)
setup-plt:   default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/work/src/plt/collects/web-server/channel.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
install: Errors in compilation process! (1)
make[1]: *** [inplace-finish] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/work/src/plt/src'
make: *** [install] Error 2

I can't find the file channel.ss anywhere. After commenting out
the `require channel.ss' in servlet-primitives:13 a new error
shows up:

setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for Web Server (/work/src/plt/collects/web-server)
setup-plt:   servlet-primitives.ss:13:2: module: identifier already imported (from a different source) at: servlet-instance in: (require "configuration.ss" "web-server-unit.ss" "min-servlet.ss" "servlet-tables.ss" "internal-s...

 Thanks for the report! This part puzzles me, though:

 The g++ command line should have an -I flag to specify the location of
 "wx.h". Isn't that -I directory searched first?

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:43:43 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
