>Description:
When I double-click the DrScheme.app icon, the dock expands briefly as if to make space for the newly open application, but then shrinks down again, and the application never opens, or draws itself on the screen. The following message displays in the Console:

12/15/08 11:53:14 PM com.apple.launchd[90] ([0x0-0x5d25d2].org.plt-scheme.DrScheme[21841]) posix_spawnp("/Users/bhyman/@/tmp/PLT Scheme v4.1.3/DrScheme.app/Contents/MacOS/DrScheme", ...): Cannot allocate memory 

Variants of this message occur with different PIDs and different memory addresses, but otherwise the same. Occasionally, right afterwards, the following message appears:

12/15/08 11:51:49 PM com.apple.launchd[90] ([0x0-0x5cb5cb].org.plt-scheme.DrScheme[21829]) Exited with exit code: 1 

When attempting to launch from the shell the DrScheme executable that's located within DrScheme.app, I get a similar message:
-bash: ./DrScheme: Cannot allocate memory

I've tried downloading another copy; the new copy of the program will then open once, but after being quit, will not open again (and displays the same behavior). The other .app files in the directory open just fine. PLT Scheme v4.1, which is what I'd been using, worked and still works fine.

Let me know what else I need to provide about my working environment, as necessary. I've yet to try downloading the source and compiling from there. Once I download Developer Tools, I will attempt it and let you know how it goes, if desired.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Download PLT Scheme v4.1.3
2) Double click the DrScheme.app icon.

 Thanks for the report!

 The path here suggests that you're installing in "/tmp". Is that right,
 or is it actually somewhere else?
 
 Thanks,

 Nevermind the "/tmp" question. I think I'm on the track of the actual
 problem, now.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:22 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
