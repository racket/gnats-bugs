>Description:
Wether you like them or not, many applications use floating tool palettes and many OSes offer special windows for them. As a typical example, instead of the modal font chooser dialog provided by MrEd's toolbox, a floating font and style palette like the Cocoa API on OS X provides might be more desirable. 

Floating palettes should use small controls and text if possible, float atop other application windows and operate on the front window's controls.

 This one will take more time, but we'll get there.
