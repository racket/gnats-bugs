>Description:

The choice% item has a good default for the `label' atribute, namely
#f. Can we use it? (I think that there are other controls that have good
defaults that aren't being used either).

 In the by-position form, the `label' argument comes first, so it can't
 have a default without gving everything a default.
 
 Offhand, I don't like the idea of giving every initialization argument
 a default, but I'll have to think about it more.

 the other alternative is to make `instantiate' more complex so that 
 it can use defaults specified earlier, even tho make-object wouldn't 
 be able to.
