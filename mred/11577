>Description:
Running the program below and resizing the resultant window does not print anything out, but I think it should.

(In the larger context when I came across this, I'm actually extending panel% if that matters.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define p%
  (class horizontal-panel% 
    (define/override (on-size w h)
      (printf "on-size\n")
      (super on-size w h))
    (super-new)))
(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 100] [height 100]))
(define p (new p% [parent f]))
(send f show #t)

 I thought I needed this for fixing the resizable panels, but I don't
 actually. If gr1 didn't do that, then I don't care if gr2 does.
