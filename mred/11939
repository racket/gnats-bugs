>Description:
Hi,

This is a purely cosmetic bug.

In the DrRacket 5.1.1 version for Ubuntu, when deleting characters
using the backspace or delete keys is laggy by which I mean
that there's a noticeable delay in deleting the character. This makes the it look like the character is still present.

This behaviour does not occur with the text% widget. 

BTW i'm running on Ubuntu 9 if that helps.

Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrRacket delete a bunch of characters holding down the delete or backspace keys.

shown, this is fixed in v5.2
