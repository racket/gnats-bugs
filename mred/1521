After exiting Dr. Scheme, Windows crashes (it pops up

Things runs fine until I exit Dr. Scheme.
It doesn't happen with just mzscheme.
And it seems to be getting more frequent.

 We will be releasing a new version of DrScheme in a couple of weeks.
 There's a good chance problem you're seeing has been fixed, but I can't
 say for sure, since I've never encountered these symptoms.
 
 Would you be interested in testing a pre-release version of 102 to
 check whether the problem is fixed?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
