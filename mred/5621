>Description:
One of the workshop participants was unable to use Matthias'
servlet teachpack, and in fact send-url seemed totally broken.
The problem turned out to be that the teacher (though he had
OS X 10.1.5 installed) had an older version of osascript installed
which did not support the -e flag.  I speculate that the more
recent versions of osascript come with the apple developer tools.

We came up with a quick fix by writing a file into the 'temp-dir,
but if osascript will read from stdin by supplying a "-" on the
command line, this would be a nicer fix.  It's going to be hard
to test this fix; that is, I don't know anyone who uses OS X
without the developer tools installed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try send-url on a machine w/o developer tools.

 As it turns out I don't have the developer tools installed;
 and would be pleased to try to help; just tell me how.

 This seems strange -- was the guy using mred or mzscheme (underneath)?
 I thought that mred would just send apple events directly, and only in
 mzscheme would we use osascript?

 Very much so.  One less thing to worry about.
