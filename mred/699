	mred -x, Xt
>Description:
	The Xt implementation of wx:canvas-dc% does not keep a pointer
to the canvas in the DC object. But a canvas DC cannot live without
its canvas. Thus, if the canvas is GCed, the DC is invalidated.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Run tb-hier.ss, first commenting out:
           (global-defined-value 'junk-canvas-object c)
>Fix:
	Make a canvas CD reference its canvas
