Responsible-Changed-When: Sat Feb  7 07:53:20 1998
Responsible-Changed-Why:

For 51/11, I changed wx:the-{pen,brush,font}-list to weakly hold the
objects in the list (rather than keeping them indefinitely). But I
didn't get the weak links right.

I've fixed the bug and released a new sparc-solaris binary. I'll make
a FreeBSD binary when I can log on. (Due to the work on the mail
spool, nw won't let me log on.) A repaired Windows binary will be
ready before 8:30AM CST 2/7.
