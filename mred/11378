>Description:
It appears that the combo-field% class in the new "GRacket2" code does not call the on-popup method when the popup button is pressed.  The code below demonstrates this by overriding both set-value and on-popup to print output.  Opening the combo's popup menu and selecting an option will produce the output from set-value but never from on-popup.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define f (new frame% [label "FRAME"]))

(define my-combo-field%
  (class combo-field%
    (super-new)
    (define/override (set-value v)
      (eprintf "VALUE: ~a\n" v)
      (super set-value v))
    (define/override (on-popup e)
      (eprintf "POPUP!\n")
      (super on-popup e))))

(define c (new my-combo-field%
               [parent f]
               [label "CHOICES"]
               [choices '("ALPHA" "BETA" "GAMMA")]))

 Are you using the `on-popup' method to replace the existing behavior or
 just to set the menu content?
 
 To work with the underlying combo widget, I think I'll have to change
 `on-popup' so that it merely lets you set the menu content.

 Setting the menu content.  I clear and repopulate the menu, then call
 the prior on-popup method.
