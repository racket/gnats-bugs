>Description:
SVN-built v4.1 on Ubuntu 8.04 64-bit fails to create a new directory in the file-save dialog box, producing an error message:

procedure .../private/list.ss:249:17: expects 1 argument, given 2: "sample folder name" #f

If 4.1 is installed via shell script, the error message is displayed with a stack trace as well:

Version 372 as installed via the Ubuntu repositories does not have this bug -- I was able to create directories by this method.
>How-To-Repeat:

Reason>>> path-dialog

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sun, 05 Oct 2008 00:46:54 -0400
Reason>>> fixed in svn, just in time for 4.1.1
(funny that this bug was there for a while now, and you
found it only a few hours after it was found by Sam...)
