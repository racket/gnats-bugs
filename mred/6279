>Description:
I classed these as "change requests," although they might be
considered "bugs." 

1) My second monitor runs at 1600x1200, or something obscene.
I attempted to make DrScheme very tall, so I could see more code
at once. It seems to be limited to a size of 1024x768. 

2) I've added the Help Desk to my Dock. When I click the app 
to launch, that's cool. When I minimize the Help Desk, it goes
to the RH side of the Dock (by the Trash). That's cool. When
I click the "launch" icon again, the Help Desk does not leave
the dock and come to the front. This isn't exactly a bug, as not
all applications bring themselves to the foreground when asked
to "launch" and they are already running, but it's a nice behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
Um. See the description, I guess. 

1) Run DrScheme on OSX on a monitor with greater than 1024x768
resolution. Try and make DrScheme fill the screen. The little 
green "maximize" button doesn't exceed this limit, either.

2) Run the Help Desk. Minimize it. Attempt to launch it again 
(from the Dock). The Help Desk won't come to the front.
