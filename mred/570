>Description:

There does not seem to be a way to count the number of items in a menu. 

I really want to delete all of the items from a menu. I see
delete-by-position, but I don't see how to find out the number of menus. I
suppose that delete-by-position could return either #t or #f, which would
also solve my problem.

 Presumably, you're always working with mred:menu% objects. Why not add
 the method there?

 I would have to re-implement delete and delete-by-position. If you added
 boolean return values to those methods, I could do it fairly easily,
 without much duplicated effort.

 I don't understand. mred:menu% already has to patch delete to remove
 callbacks from it's list. (It doesn't patch delete-by-position, so
 there's currently a bug.)
 
 Still, if you think it's worthwhile for me to change delete and
 delete-by-position four times, then I'll do it. In that case, I might
 as well add a number method; it's no less work.

 Ah. I see. The callbacks variable contains the same information that I
 would want from some internal wx: list of menu items.

 A number method should not be four additions, the only thing that
 should be four additions is exposing some state, to allow a single impl. 
 
 I am happy to do the single implementation, but I am less happy to maintain
 a separate copy of the same state that wx: maintains. In general, I believe
 that this "single point of control" is the wiser path, even if that means
 there will have to be four changes to the code to allow these single
 implementations.
 
 But, in this case (for this application), it turns out I can save the menu
 ids, so I can just delete them like that and we don't need to make any
 changes to anything.

 Although I'm trying very hard to understand, I just don't see how four
 exposures of the number state is different from four implementatios of
 Number(). Perhaps you assume that there is some instance variable
 common to all implementations that contains the number; this is not
 the case. Even if it were the case, I would have to change four header
 files to expose the instance variable, which I certainly count as four
 implementations of Number().

 I was imagining that there were four different lists of menu-items. Then,
 someone would have to unify the names three times (painful) to allow one
 simple implementation (essentially "length").

State-Changed-Why:
wx:menu% and wx:menu-bar now have `number' methods; the
delete methods return #t on sucess, #f on failure.
For the latter, mred:menu% probably needs to be updated
to preserve this behavior.
