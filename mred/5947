Hi -

I am with the MathCS department at Macalester College.  Our professor, Richard Molnar, uses Dr. Scheme extensively with Mac OS 9.2 and OS X.  He has many problems, most related to printing, and would like the following list passed on to you.

Dr. Scheme (version 201) on Max OS 9.2.2, 512 Mb memory:

    -- files longer than a certain size (not always
       the same) when printed from Dr. Scheme, cause
        it to crash.
    -- sometimes, when Dr. Scheme is restarted, trying to
        print invokes the "Print" dialog, but when it
        closes, the print job just disappears.
        Sometimes, I have to reboot the system, not just
        Dr. Scheme, to get it to work.
    -- Sometimes these anomalies cause other problems: it
        frequently is the case that the [Save Other] option
         under the [Print] menu sdoes not show the options
        for you to select (the sub-window of the 4 options
        simply does not appear.

    -- Trying to print to pdf (using Adobe Acrobat PDF
       Writer) fails--the adobe windows come up, it
       appears to "work"  but then the process skips and
       no file is generated.  Sometinmes this seems to 
cause
       later "ordinary print" jobs to disappear.

Dr. Scheme (V 201) on the powerbook, under OS X (V 10.1.3, 
192 Mb. Memory)

    -- print jobs are incredibly slow, when they work
        --sometimes 5-10 min per page
    -- some print jobs give some error condition, even
       though Dr. Scheme has NO problem opening, saving, or
       executing the file
    -- If I preview, then save to pdf, then print the pdf,
       sometimes only the first page actually gets printed;
      even if the  print center says a larger nunmber of
      pages were sent to the printer.
    -- If I save to pdf, and it works, then move the pdf
        file to another computer (e.g., the other mac under
        OS 9), the pdf file looksdifferent--things which
        show up on the OS X machine do not appear in the pdf
        file on the other machine. (maybe it should 
becalled
          nspdf -- "not so portable document format"

All versions of Dr. Scheme, 100's through 200's:

    -- It will only print up to 3 pages of interactions,
       no matter how many pages are there.  I think this
       is also a problem with PC's, because my students,
      who use PC's in the lab, or their own computers, have
      this problem also.

    -- When I take the powerbook in to class to display
      using the projector, (or for that matter, when I use
      the dual monitors connected to my office machne!)
      I like to have the two screens display different
       things--
      showing some things to the students on the "second"
      screen, projected from the projector, and having
      other things visible only on my screen (partly to
      keep the projection "clean" and not overloaded with
      irellevant info, and partly for peagogical reasons.
      Dr. Scheme windoew open in the "secod" screen are not
      drawn properly--things disappear, like the window
      scrolling bars, some of the "button" (e.g. for
      [Execute] etc.), blocks of the windows "whited" out
      etc.


I use lots of applications, on both Macs, including the 
microsoft products (word ,excel, Int Exp, Ppt), Framemaker,
Mathematica, mulberry, Moscow ml, Netscape, etc. and NO 
other appliction has these problems,
   EXCEPT:  Netscape seems to crash if I try to
            print to pdf.

Printing is important; and printing to pdf is also 
important, since:
    I use it to "preview",
    I use it to post documents for students so they can
     read them (even if they don't have my applictions
     on their machines),
    I use it to prepare "slides", and
    I use it to "mark up" and highlight documents for
     students.
