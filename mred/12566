>Description:
After I stop a universe/big-bang animation using the Stop button in Dr. Racket I still am not able to close the associated windows, i.e., the one with state and the one with the actual animation.

This is on a Mac: the three circles in the left corner of the title bar of both windows are sometimes colored, sometimes, blank, and never responsive to clicks. All of this does not affect the windows that are part of Dr. Racket itself at all. The usual keystrokes are also ineffective.

This might be the same as bug 10450 but it happens to me every time as far as I am aware, i.e., I've never noticed it not happening since I started messing with animations using big-bang which has been about a week. I call it serious because it's a constant inconvenience but it's not critical because it's merely inconvenient.

 Does the window go away when you re-run your programs? (It does for me.)

 Yes.
 
 Hitting the Run button causes both big-bang related windows to disappear.

 Good, so the inconvenience is contained. (There is a different -- and truly maddening bug -- but that on rare occasion keeps up the window after you re-run the program.)

 Stupid question. When I did a code review of 2htdp/universe with Matthew, we re-organized the eventspace organization so that big-bang is launched in its own eventspace and I took out all other mentions of eventspace from the private/world implementation.
 
 Here is what you could imagine it reduces to: 
 
 #lang racket/gui
 
 (define evtsp (make-eventspace))
 (define evtth (eventspace-handler-thread evtsp))
 (parameterize ((current-eventspace evtsp))
   (with-handlers ((exn:break? (lambda (x) (displayln 'break!) (break-thread evtth))))
   ;; Here I call run from universe but this is all we need: 
   ;; -------
   (define frame (new frame% [label "hello world, how is this?"] [width 300] [height 400]))
   (send frame show #t)
     (let L ()
       ;; imagine universe stuff happening here 
       (L))))
 
 Mulhern's bug has been with us since. I assume break-thread for evtth also breaks the handling of the three little Mac buttons. 
 
 Do I have to create the frame (in private/world) in a nested eventspace and IF I KILL THE handler from the outer eventspace that won't affect the inner one? I have tested this so I think it works, it just confuses me. I had assumed that nested eventspaces would get stuck when the outer handler thread is killed.

 I'm surprised by the behavior of this program. I would have expected
 that breaking an eventspace handler thread would simply break that one
 callback (or perhaps the next one if there is no callback running),
 not make the handler thread stop handling events. I think that this
 must be a bug, because if there was actually an eventcallback running,
 I'm pretty sure it would just break that one callback.
 
 (I don't think there is a notion of nesting in eventspaces.)
