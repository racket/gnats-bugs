mac-ppc-macos
>Description:
After downloading and unpacking the plt folder, I am repeatedly unable to install DrScheme: after clicking on the Setup PLT icon, the "help" menu name briefly appears, then the install stops and reverts back to the desktop.  Originally it gave an error message saying "carbonlib extension not found".  I since installed carbonlib (v1.3, 1.4. 1.6) but the above problem remains.  Help!  Thanks. 
>How-To-Repeat:
- plt.ppc-mac.sit downloaded from the web & unstuffed.
- plt folder opened on desktop
- Setup PLT icon double-clicked
- "Setup PLT" and "Help" briefly appear on top menu bar before install stops.
