>Description:
When bringing up the Help Desk bug report form, the Severity
and Class choice lists take up the whole form.  Resizing the 
form shrinks them to normal size.  Probably this is specific 
to X.

Also, the entry area for "Environment" is a little displaced to
the right.  Again, I'm guessing this is an X problem.




>How-To-Repeat:
Under Solaris, fire up Help Desk, click on Submit bug report.

 This doesn't happen on the mac, and may even be specific to your X
 server.

        This doesn't happen on the mac, and may even be specific to your X
         server.
 
 The problem also occurs with XFree86 in Red Hat Linux 6.0 when running
 Help Desk remotely from Solaris.
