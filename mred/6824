Just as MrEd is being copied 
to the install directory the installer does a
"could not read memory at location ...."
and the DrScheme executable is not installed
(win2k sp3)

>How-To-Repeat:
run the installer (after the 1st GPF I uninstalled
the previous PLT & restarted the machine, thinking
some program might still be locked in that
directory.)

On a just-rebooted system the same thing happened.

Same problem with 206

 This is a known bug that was not caught yet.  The best that we can say
 at this point is that you should try to disable your network somehow,
 either shut down the network services or simply pull the cable out.  I
 will mark this bug as a duplicate, but still, please tell me if this
 worked for you.
