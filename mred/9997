 This probably broke when I changed cache-image-snip% to be a subclass  
 of image-snip%. I bet there's a pair of is-a? tests that need to be  
 reversed, but it will be an hour or two before I can check.

 Sorry -- I'm all over the place today. FWIW, it looks like lots of
 things broke in the test suite.
 
 I'll try to look into it now.

 It's fixed.
 
 I forgot to look for the test suite before. I ran the DrScheme language
 tests, instead since they had images, and then I forgot to look for
 more specific tests.

 Thanks. I had made the same change in my tree and was trying to sort
 out that failing test. :)
