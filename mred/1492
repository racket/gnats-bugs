 In plt:collects:launcher:, you should have a GoMz with the MzScheme
 icon (plus arrow), and a GoMr with the MrEd icon (plus arrow).
 
 Is that the case?
 
 Thanks,

 Judging from the new "Starters.mcp" project, the problem was 
 introduced when John combined a bunch of projects together.
 
 I can just linux for now.

 John, I asked Robby about the GoMz and GoMr apps in
 plt:collect:launchers:

 Robby, how do those apps get there? Do you build them or download them?
 (I'm fairly certain they're not in CVS.)

 All fixed now.  The Starters.mcp project needs slightly different 
 settings (different creator ids, different project header files) for 
 the two targets.
 
 New version of cw.sit.hqx committed & exp-tagged.
