>Description:
I can't find any GUI class that allows a different parent after the object has been instantiated.

I assume that this is a limitation in wxWindows. If that is the case, IMHO, this is something that should be changed in the switch to a Scheme-based GUI library.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try this program:

#lang scheme/gui

; Make a frame by instantiating the frame% class
(define frame1
  (new frame%
       [label "Example 1"]))

; Make a button in the frame
(define the-button
  (new button% 
       [parent frame1]
       [label "Click Me"]
       ; Callback procedure for a button click:
       (callback (lambda (button event)
                   ((class-field-mutator button% parent) frame2)
                   (send frame2 show #t)))))

; Show the frame by calling its show method
(send frame1 show #t)

(define frame2
  (new frame%
       [label "Example 2"]))

 BTW, This is essential for making FrTime work well for GUIs rather
 than just animations.

 ah I thought change-children would do this for you but alas, it has a =20=
 
 contract that I didn't recall before:

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 27 Nov 2011 19:42:17 -0500
Reason>>> `subwindow<%>' how has `reparent'
