>Description:
I still use release 103p1 since later releases are not backward compatible
with the 103p1 unit system.  The rpm distribution generates a segmentation
fault on installation (rpm -i  plt-103p1-1.i386.rpm).  The tarball distribution
generates segfault as soon as you try to execute the drscheme binary.
Other users running Linux Redhat 7.3 have confirmed the same behavior.


>How-To-Repeat:
See above.  The installation (for the RPM distribution) or initial execution (for the tarball
distribution) of release 103p1 on Redhat Linux 7.3 generates the segmentation fault.

 Hi Corky,
 
   I suspect that this is a problem with newer versions of the libraries
 on your system than drscheme was linked against.
 
 Your best bet is to recompile from the sources. It's not a difficult
 procedure and is all explained in plt/src/README (and other READMEs,
 but that's the place to start).

 The usual problem is that the stack limit reported to Mzscheme by newer
 versions of Linux is one byte less than 4GB. That confuses MzScheme's
 computation of the stack bounds, since the arithmetic overflows. (In
 v200, we avoid the problem by limiting the stack size to 8MB).
 
 If you limit stacksize before installing or starting DrScheme, the seg
 fault will likely go away. I can provide a source path if you prefer to
 recompile from source.
