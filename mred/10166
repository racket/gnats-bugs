>Description:
Using default settings with DrScheme 4.1.4 on Windows Vista and a conventional LCD monitor, highlighted  glyphs are rendered incorrectly. Depending on the colour of the text, only glyphs' outermost pixels or their whole surfaces may be affected. 
This remains the case whatever my rendering settings in Windows and in DrScheme, except when, in the latter, all antialiasing is turned off. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme, type any code (especially comments) and select it.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 16 Jan 2011 22:23:27 -0500
Reason>>> the next version (with a rewritten GUI library)
renders selected text the right way for Windows
