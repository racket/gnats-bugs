>Environment:
MS Windows 95
>Description:
Sometime get-top-level-focus-window returns #f when there is a window
on top. This breaks the drscheme test suite.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "frame" #f))
(define dialog (make-object dialog% "dialog" frame))
(send frame show #t)
(thread (lambda () (sleep 2) (printf "~s~n" (get-top-level-focus-window))))
(send dialog show #t)

;; the printout should not be #f, but it is.
