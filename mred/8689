>Description:
Open drscheme with say 10 or 20 files so that 
there are more tabs than the width of the 
monitor allows. 

I know I can navigate to the "off screen" 
tabs with control/shift arrows (and 'reopen') 
but I think the tab status line should give some
drop-down menu navigation facility, along the 
lines of Firefox or Safari. 

[I did this on a 27" in monitor. And it was
a pain to navigate.]

 Matthew: is that something that should be built into the control at
 the mred level, or something drs should do?
 
 (Also along these lines, the browsers all have little "close" buttons
 in the tabs that might be nice to add to mred's tabs)

 I second that.

either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been

problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares

 I think the close-button part of this is still open, but the other
 part is now fixed.
