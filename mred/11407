>Description:
Starting sometime yesterday, I noticed that I can't resize windows.  GRacket refuses to get maximized when I try to, and if I resize the window (any window), it immediately crashes with a "Racket virtual machine has run out of memory; aborting" error.  (And gdb on the core dump doesn't look like it says anything useful.)

I *think* that it used to work, and now it doesn't (I resize windows often).

 Possibly related, I tried this:
 
   -> ,r racket/gui
   -> (define f (new frame% [label "Foo"] [min-width 100] [min-height 100]))i
   -> (send f show #t)
 
 I get the frame to show up.  Now, grabbing a corner or an edge and
 trying to make it smaller does nothing, but trying to make it bigger
 makes it be 1 pixel in the respective dimension.  For example, I
 drag the lower edge *down*, and the window becomes 100x1.  When I now
 exit racket, it spits out this possibly useful error while exiting:
 
   on-size in window<%>: expected argument of type <exact integer in [0, 10000]>; given 65535

   The program '<unknown>' received an X Window System error.
   This probably reflects a bug in the program.
   The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
     (Details: serial 334 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
     (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
      that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
      To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
      option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
      backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

 (This is on an x86_64 build.)
