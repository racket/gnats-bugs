 Contract violation with no way to reproduce it and, in this case,
 totally useless (especially because there is no source loc for the
 violation).
 
 Of course, the idea that I had to solve this kind of thing requires you
 to be able to re-run the program and demonstrate the problem.

 FWIW, there seem to be only two calls to pen%'s `set-color' in all of
 plt/collects. (I fixed the spelling in the error message.)

 Well, it's good to know that there is a bug, but I wouldn't know where
 to begin to find this one. It could really be anywhere.

 None in plt/collects/mred/mred.ss? Well, I guess that narrows down the
 source location :)
 
 I'll have to look for something obvious, but IIRC there are some
 non-trivial invariants at play to make sure that this error doesn't
 happen. 
 
 I wonder, Matthias: did you ever see any other internal error messages
 before this on the in the same DrScheme?

 Ah. I see a possible bug! It would require one instance of the
 framework to run in two different eventspaces and be simultaneously
 highlighting regions in those two frames, but maybe that's it somehow
 (that shouldn't be possible just because only the focus'd window should
 ever draw such highglights, but hey) I've fixed that bug -- now the
 framework create a new pen for each frame instance. I bet that there
 are more such bugs -- the framework isn't thread safe.
 
 How do you test for that?!?

 No, it showed up in DrScheme, and Dr became unusuable afterwards.

 So this bug wasn't it, unless some tool is creating new eventspaces
 (but even if it were, this seems unlikely).

 No. 
 
 I think I did a lot of work with pens with this instance (but it could be
 that I closed that DrScheme). I didn't use the pen list.

 This shouldn't matter for this bug, but I wonder, since DrScheme shares
 '(lib "mred.ss" "mred") with the running program, how do I know that
 the pen lists aren't shared? Or, are they? And, do the pen lists always
 return locked pens?

 Shared and always locked.
