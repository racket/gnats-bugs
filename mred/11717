>Description:
Middle-clicking in the definitions pane of DrRacket crashes it with the error shown below.  This happens every time for me.

My X selections and clipboard look like plain text.

This is using pre 5.1.0.2 that I downloaded and built from racket-clean-tree.tgz on 2011-02-08.

/usr/local/racket-pre-20110208/bin/drracket
GtkSelectionDataT-data: expected argument of type <struct:GtkSelectionDataT>; given #<cpointer:GtkSelectionData>
