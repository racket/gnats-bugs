SunOS slingblade 5.5.1 Generic_103640-05 sun4c sparc SUNW,Sun_4_75

After downloading and installing the MrEd binary distribution
for Solaris, both MrEd and MzScheme don't run, but rather
give a segmentation fault.

I've also tried the MOTIF version for Solaris and have the
same problem.

>How-To-Repeat:
slingblade:~/scheme> tar zxpf ~/archive/mred.sparc-solaris.tar.gz 

slingblade:~/scheme/plt> ./install
setting PLTHOME to /home/jason/scheme/plt in scripts:
 updating bin/archsys
 updating bin/mred
 updating bin/mzc
 updating bin/mzos
 updating bin/mzscheme
 updating bin/setup-plt
DrScheme starts up much faster with ".zo" files, but creating ".zo"
files now takes a few minutes and requires about 5MB of additional
disk space. Create ".zo" files later by running plt/bin/setup-plt.
-n  Create ".zo" files now (y/n)? [y] 
y
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
PLT installation done

slingblade:~/scheme/plt> .bin/sparc-solaris/mzscheme

The problem is almost certainly a GC bug that is already fixed in
100alpha1. (Uses mmap with MMAP_FIXED, instead of letting the OS pick
where to allocate the block.)
