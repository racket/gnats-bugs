On a danish keyboard you have to press "AltGr+<" to produce a blackslash.
In the DrScheme-editor an attempt to produce a blackslash now results in a lambda.
How do I write a backslash?

 Just in case it wasn't clear, the lambda key is supposed to be bound to
 <menu-key>-backslash, not just backslash. The backslash key does not
 require any modifiers on my keyboard.

 Can you run
 
  mred -qr ..../collects/tests/mred/showkey.ss
 
 and tell me what it reports when you press AltGr+< ?

 It shows a normal \.
 
 (A \ also showed up in the bug report form. It is
 only in DrScheme I see the problem. Both in the
 definition and interaction window.)

 But I'm interested in all the reported information, including modifiers
 and the key-up event.

 I were in a hurry this morning, so I missed the -qr part.
 Curiosly I had to open MrEd and use "Load File" before
 I got to see the following when I pressed AltGr+< :

 So ... when you push it, it is a backslash, but when you let go it is
 either a less-than or a greater-than? That's weird ...

 JFYI, I haven't made any progress because my Windows machine died, but
 I haven't forgotten.
 
 (Actually, my MacBook died, but that's my only vehicle for Windows
 development while on sabbatical.)

 [My MacBook is still dead, but last week I gave in and requested an
  account in the Windows lab.]
 
 There are two parts to the story:
 
  * In v301, Ctl-\ works for a Danish keyboard because there's an awful
    hack that remaps ASCII 28 to Ctl-\. Meanwhile, Ctl-\ is mapped by
    default to ASCII 28 on a Danish keyboard (I think), because there's
    no sensible control-character mapping for Ctl-< or Ctl->.
 
    In v352, MrEd works harder to avoid translation of control characters,
    so it reports Ctl-< more property as Ctl-<.
 
  * Also, in v301, Ctl-\ in as a menu shortcut matches only when the Alt
    key is not also pressed. In other words, the editor keymap entry is
    ":c:\\". In v352, it's "c:\\". The reason for this is that a user
    may need to press some other modifier --- say, AltGr --- to get a
    backslash.
 
 I think that v352 is doing the right thing at the MrEd level. Ctl-<
 properly shows up as Ctl-<, and AltGr-< properly shows up as Alt-Ctl-\
 (just like Alt-Ctl-< shows up as Alt-Ctl-\).
 
 It's probably for this reason that the Windows guidelines explicitly
 say that \ should not be used for menu shortcuts --- along with other
 things I find via AltGr in Danish mode, such as @ and ₤.
 
 Probably we should obey the Windows guidelines and not try to map \ as
 a menu shortcut in DrScheme.

 It is a shame to lose this particular shortcut :(
 
 Does Windows' guidelines carry over to the mac? If not, is it easy to
 explain what's different? What about the modified backslash (now that
 mred supports an additional modifier in keyboard shortcuts).

 After looking at more keyboard layouts, it's possible that AltGr (i.e.,
 Alt+Ctl) is always used to access extra keys, never Alt by itself. So
 maybe adding "~m:" under Windows (i.e., !Alt) is the right starting
 point.
 
 Then, Jens Axel won't be able to use the Ctl-\ shortcut, but he will be
 able to type \. And maybe he could re-map the menu item to Ctl-< (?).
 
 I'll have to investigate more later, because I'd like to look more at
 Microsoft's documentation, but the keyboard part doesn't work under
 either Safari or Firefox (naturally).
 
 Whatever we pick for Windows probably applies to Unix. The Mac is
 different, since Cmd is never used to type different letters. (That's
 the job of Opt, so menu key bindings should be "m:" and not ":m:".)

 After learning more about keyboard layouts, I'm convinced that the
 right thing is for a menu shortcut to require an exact match for the
 Alt/Meta part of the key specification (under Windows and X). I've
 committed that change.
 
 So, Jens Axel will not be able to use the Ctl-\ shortcut.
 
 We could instead treat AltGr sortof like Shift. That is, MrEd could
 figure out what character would be generated if AltGr is pressed or
 not, and then report that (in addition to the character that would be
 generated if Shift were pressed or not). I'd rather not do that,
 though.
 
 FWIW, here are all the characters that Microsoft says not to use for
 shortcuts:
 
   @ ? ? $ { } [ ] \ ~ | ^ ' < >

 I'm not sure what is the right thing to do here. It seems like we
 should either disallow all of those keys or let the programmer specify
 backups of some kind that would be used on keyboards like Jens Axel's?
 Or maybe some 3rd option?

 I didn't know that AltGr = Alt+Ctrl, but now the DrScheme behaviour
 makes sense to me.

 Now ctrl+< inserts an <, so that would be fine (and convenient too,
 since the < key is in the vicinity of ctrl.
 
 
 How about other international keyboards - do they have the same
 problem?
