  2) open the monitors control panel and move the second monitor
  3) execute the program in drscheme again

the entire machine froze.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:35:26 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
