>Description:
Dr. Scheme has never gone beyond starting briefly (I see the Dr. Scheme title in the window heading) before the Mac returns to the Finder.  It started out requiring 200k which I thought was rather small anyway.  However
boosting it to 20000k didn't get it to work.  Help Desk and Games don't work.  When clicking on MrEd I get that MrEd can't be opened because "WindowsLib" can't be found.  I'm using Mac OS8.1 on a machine with a G3 233 replacement processor on my 7500 motherboard.  I have 112mb memory in this machine.

Thanks for your help.

Joe
