>Description:
The current development version of DrRacket draws some picts wrong when they are displayed in the interactions window. The problem does not occur when the picts are shown in slideshows, nor when the picts are drawn to PNGs as part of rendering a Scribble document. The problem does not occur in DrRacket 5.2.1.

 Probably something wrong with record-dc%. This draws the same wrong
 way that DrRacket draws.
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (require slideshow/pict)
 (define p (standard-fish 50 50))
 
 (define rdc (new record-dc%))
 (draw-pict p rdc 0 0)
 (define draw-p (recorded-datum->procedure (send rdc get-recorded-datum)))
 
 (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 400] [height 400]))
 (define c (new canvas%
                [parent f]
                [paint-callback
                 (Î» (c dc)
                   (draw-p dc))]))
 (send f show #t)
