	mred -x, drscheme -x, WIndows NT, FreeBSD
>Description:
	In MrEd (and DrScheme for non-Scheme files), buffers that have
been edited and not saved get autosaved. This is good. It's also good
that when the user closes the buffer (hitting "ok" for the warning),
the autosave file is deleted. HOWEVER, one the next autosave cycle,
the buffer is re-autosaved. (This may rely on relatively frequent
autosaves with not too much gc in between.)
>How-To-Repeat:
	Open a file in MrEd. Edit and do not save. Close the buffer.
Wait for autosave-delay seconds and do nothing else. See the autosave
file appear again.
>Fix:
