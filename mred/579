 Cmd-C doesn't work?

 Sorry. cmd-c does work, usually. The first time I tried it, mred
 exited. The next few times, it worked.
 
 The error message I got was:
 
   procedure application: expected procedure, got #<procedure:...> ...
 
 or something similar. Do you know what can cause that error message? I
 deleted the .zo files and it went away. 
 
 I am getting some funny stuff on the mac and have been for the last few
 hours. I am going to move to another machine where the bugs will at least
 be reproducible.
 
 The other notable is this:
 
  illegal identifier: (lambda (#<bad-value>) ... #<bad-value> ...)
 
 I forget what the ...'s are. So, I think something is wrong, but I can't
 reproduce anything. It's been pretty frustrating.
