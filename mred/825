>Description:
A #f value for the scroll-ok? parameter of the edit%/insert method
only works one level deep.  When used on a nested edit%, the view
scrolls anyway.

This is really annoying for the application I'm developing.  Is there
a short-term workaround?

 I can't reproduce the bug myself, so I'll need the code. Or maybe you
 can adjust the program below to more accurately reflect your
 situation.
 
 Thanks,

 (define f (make-object mred:frame% null "Insert" -1 -1 100 100))
 (define p (make-object mred:vertical-panel% f))
 (define c (make-object mred:media-canvas% p))
 (define e (make-object mred:media-edit%))
 (send c set-media e)
 
 (let loop ([i 100])
   (unless (zero? i)
     (send e insert (format "~a~n" i))
     (loop (sub1 i))))
 
 (define m (make-object mred:media-snip%))
 (send e insert m)
 
 (send f show #t)
 
 (define me (send m get-media))
 
 (define (go)
   (send me insert "hi" 0 -1 #f))
 
 ; After the frame has appeared, evaluate (go) and
 ; check whether the scroll changes

Here's Mike's code:

(let* ((frame (make-object mred:frame% null "Test" -1 -1 300 50))
       (panel (make-object mred:vertical-panel% frame))
       (edit (make-object mred:media-edit%))
       (canvas (make-object mred:media-canvas% panel)))
  (send canvas set-media edit)
  (send edit insert "Foo") (send edit insert #\newline)
  (send edit insert "Bar") (send edit insert #\newline)
  (send edit insert "Baz") (send edit insert #\newline)
  (send frame show #t)
  
  (let* ((nested-edit (make-object mred:media-edit%))
	 (nested-snip (make-object mred:media-snip% nested-edit #t)))

    (send nested-edit insert "Bla")
    (send edit insert nested-snip (send edit last-position) (send edit last-position) #f)
    (send nested-edit insert "Balabaz" 0 (send edit last-position) #f)))

The problem was that the scroll-ok? flag wasn't propagated correctly
to the inplicit delete. Fixed for the next release.
