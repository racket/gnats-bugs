 I've actually been using DrScheme sucessfully in RH 7.1 for a while,
 even compiling with the horribly broken gcc 2.96 that RH 7.1 provides.
 
 A few questions:
 
  * What is the default stack limit? (In csh, `limit' will report the
    value.)
 
  * Are you using gcc 2.96, or a different compiler?
 
  * Can you get a stack trace? Something like this:
 
      % gdb plt/.bin/i386-linux/mzscheme
      (gdb) run
       .. seg fault ...
      (gdb) where
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
