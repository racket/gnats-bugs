        when I open drscheme close it and the open it again,
        the fonts change to simple.
        If I then dare to close it and open it again (1 or 2 times), 
        the computer hangs, and the only way to recover is to boot up 
        the computer.
        
 Does this behavior occur reliably, even after you reboot?
 I find that sometimes Win95 gets into a funny state where
 programs appear to misbehave, but rebooting fixes the problem.

 Indeed, windows95 misbehave after a few loads of drscheme.
 After I reboot the computer win95 behave normally,
 but if I then load drscheme few times again, the problem
 I reported repeat itself.
 for now, I uninstalled drschme v.101 and installed drscheme v.100
 insted. until now, allthough I didn't use it for a long time,
 It seems to be stable.
 
 p.s- 
 I run drscheme on pentium-133 with 32 MB of ram.

 Had you uninstalled v.100 before installing v.101?
 
 I just tried loading and unloading DrScheme 101 on an NT4
 box, with no problems.

 No, because before I installed version 101, I used in version 51.
 I uninstalled version 51 before I installed version 101.
 I talked to a friend of mine and he told me that he encounterd the same
 problem (he using win95 with 16 mb of ram on cyrix 100 mhz).
 It is worth to mention that my win95 support hebraw (hebraw enabled - that
 means that all the menus and the messages are in english, but I can read
 files both in english and hebraw).
 
 - eyal.

 Eyal,
 
 	We've tried v101 on a Win95 computer, with no problems
 like the one you report.  It's possible that the problem is related 
 to the Hebrew version of Win95.
