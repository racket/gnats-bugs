It is still possible to break the interaction with file|quit, the close box
and un-saved files in drscheme.

this is not a simple problem. The state space here is fairly large. This
seems like a perfect problem for some verification technique. Or, in our
case, a good test suite. (of course, some thought will have to go into
making it automatic. Probably shell-scripts are required)

>How-To-Repeat:

1) startup drscheme
2) type "a" in the defn's window.
3) choose file|quit
4) click "quit" (or "okay" or whatever)
5) click "save"
6) click "cancel"

drscheme exits anyway.

another one:

1) startup drscheme
3) click the close box
5) click cancel

drscheme now has no open windows and has not quit

another one:

1) startup drscheme
2) type "a" in the defn's window.
3) click the close box
4) click close anyway
5) click cancel

there maybe more ways. There are lots of other things in this vein to try

 I apparently had the wrong version of the code on my machine. There has
 been no change to the history file or any posted mention that fixed had
 been released to the public.
 
 Regardless, the new behaviour under the first set of actions is still wrong
 since I had a modified file, I quit, and I wasn't asked to save the
 file. Here is a revised sequnce of actions:
 
 1) type "a" in the definitions window
 2) choose "file|quit"
 
 The user never sees a prompt asking to save the file.
 
 Another sequence:
 
 1) disable the "verify exit" preference
 2) type "a" in the definitons window
 3) choose "file|quit"
 
 The user is not asked to save his work.
 
 Another one:
 
 1) open a new frame
 2) type "a" in the definitions window
 3) click the close box
 4) choose "save"
 5) choose "cancel" in the save dialog
 
 The window closes anyway.
 
 Another (related) one:
 
 1) type "a" in the definitions window
 2) open a new frame
 3) type "a" in that definitions window
 4) choose "file|quit"
 
 I was only prompted to save one of the files. (I don't know which one,
 presumably the second one)
