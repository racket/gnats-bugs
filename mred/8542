>Description:
I'm drawing text onto an editor using the editor's on-paint method. The text I draw to the dc appears in the correct place, but sometimes it also appears on the line where the caret is. When the caret moves, the text sometimes remains, so I can have several copies of the drawn text visible in the editor at the same time.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is a program that reproduces the problem on my system. When you run the program, it will pop up a frame containing an editor. On my computer, the editor has two "?" characters; it should only have one. Pressing the up arrow key to move the caret creates more copies of the spurious "?".


  (require (lib "class.ss")
           (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
  
  (define crazy-text%
    (class text%
      (define/override (on-paint before? dc L T R B dx dy C?)
        (super on-paint before? dc L T R B dx dy C?)
        (unless before?
          (send dc draw-text "?" 100 19)))
      (super-new)))
  
  (define f (new frame% (label "testing") (width 300) (height 300)))
  (define t (new crazy-text%))
  (define ec (new editor-canvas% (parent f) (editor t)))
  (send f show #t)
  (send t insert "\n\n\n\n")

Reason>>> Not a bug: I didn't realize I needed to adjust the drawing
coordinates. Apologies.
