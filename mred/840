>Description:

When using the user-min-width method of a canvas%, it raises this error:

   min-width: value out-of-range 200 to 10000: 36

There are two problems with that to my eye:

1) user-min-width should not have any such restriction
2) the error message label is wrong

; ---

Also, when trying to reproduce/simplify this message, I got repeated
crashes from MrEd. I think that the crashes may have had something to do
with pasting. The first time, I pasted from an xterm, using the
middle-button and MrEd crashed my entire machine (in fact, when it rebooted 
the first time, I got a kernel panic as it tried to chdsk the disk. Scary!
Luckily things seem to be working now). The second time, I used cut and
paste from the menus in mred and only mred itself crashed.

>How-To-Repeat:

I cannot simply this easily, since mred has been crashing. Here is the
errortrace.ss trace:

min-width: value out-of-range 200 to 10000: 36
  ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote min-client-width)) gc-width) in /home/robby/plt/collects/framework/frame.ss
  (#%let-values (((send*317) gc-canvas)) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote min-client-width)) gc-width) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote min-client-height)) gc-height) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote stretchable-width)) #f) ((#%ivar/proc send*317 (#%quote stretchable-height)) #f)) in /home/robby/plt/collects/framework/frame.ss
  (apply super-init args) in /home/robby/plt/collects/framework/frame.ss

I invoked mred with:

[Fri 04 Dec] ~> mred -L framework.ss framework -e "(error-print-width 500)" -e '(send (make-object frame:text-info% "test") show #t)'

So, why don't we see the (send ... show #t) or the (make-object ...)
expressions in the errortrace.ss trace?
