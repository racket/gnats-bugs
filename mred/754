>Description:
Just a typo, but prevented launch of DrScheme.

Was *not* caught by Setup. It seems that one must regenerate the .zo files.

I will add that I can't successfully launch DrScheme on my Performa 6115. I  (sometimes) get through the load progress bar and then everything freezes. I have been able to launch MrEd, but there were some sporatic problems there.

If I figure anything else about this, I'll let you know.

 frame.ss must have been corrupted somewhere along the way. Certainly,
 it isn't corrupted in the Windows distributions, but I haven't myself
 unpacked the MacOS bundle.
 
 Did you get the .sit archive, or the .tar.gz archive?  If you got the
 .tar.gz archive, what did you use to unpack it?

 This sounds like a memory problem, i.e., DrScheme is very memory
 hungry and requires about 32 MB of RAM to run. How much memory does
 your machine have? (If you have at least 32 MB, then we'll need to
 look for other causes.)
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

When Clements used StuffIt Expander to unpack the .tar.gz file, he got
this behavior.

We don't distribute .tar.gz files for the mac, anymore.
