>Description:
Summary mostly says it all. I've had delays reach up to five seconds per action before restarting.

The bug seems to affect most CTRL/ALT actions, including word navigation, s-expression navigation, history navigation (interactions window), run, cut, copy, paste, and undo. Restarting cures it.

Apparently unaffected: edit/text controls on the Bug Report Form and other dialogs; highlighting and other SHIFT+key actions; shortcut menu combos for Save, Open, New Tab, Kill, Break, and others.
>How-To-Repeat:
To see the problem best:
1. Open DrRacket.
2. Type a line of random characters that includes spaces.
3. Place the caret at the start of the line.
4. Hold down SHIFT+CTRL, and use the left/right arrow keys to highlight and unhighlight the line repeatedly.

Each SHIFT+CTRL+arrow use starts fast, and then quickly becomes very slow, on the order of seconds. Try other CTRL+key or ALT+key actions listed in the description - they'll all be very slow.

Hold down a CTRL+arrow key only if you want to wait a minute or more for the GUI to respond. Might be a good quick test *after* the bug is fixed. :)

 Ctrl and Alt key combination trigger menu `on-demand' actions (in case
 the combination will be bound to a menu item), and DrRacket seems to
 make many menu changes in `on-demand' that caused Gtk widget
 allocations. Memory management was broken for menu and menu-item
 widgets.
 
 That's now fixed, so see if it's better. It still seems sluggish to me,
 but maybe that's baseline sluggishness instead of something that gets
 worse with use.
 
 Meanwhile, we should look more into speeding up DrRacket's menu
 `on-demand' work, either at the `racket/gui' or DrRacket levels.

 I found a couple of things.
 
 The big one was that `on-demand' was called three times for every key
 event, instead of just once. That was related to a GRacket2 change that
 introduced a couple of layers of internal panels in a frame. Fixing
 that problem cuts the overhead by a factor of 3.
 
 The second one was that DrRacket rebuilds some menus on demand
 unnecessarily. I reduced that effect through a DrRacket chang. Still,
 the menu of recently-opened files (which is a framework feature) is
 rebuilt on every key event that might be a menu shortcut, which seems
 wasteful because that list can be long and rarely changes.
 
 Overall, ctrl-arrow events in DrRacket now seem much more responsive.

 OH, I'm wrong. I can avoid the allocation without sync stuff.
 Nevermind. (But Matthew sent a private messages suggesting that
 avoiding allocation probably wont' matter anyways, confirming my
 suspicions.)

 This should be better now.
 
 It still does some allocation there, but I didn't see how to
 completely avoid allocation since I still have to call get-items
 (well, I could cache more things but that requires syncronization so I
 didn't try to go that far) so it could still be yet better probably.
 If it matters.

 Seems like the problem is gone. Thanks!
