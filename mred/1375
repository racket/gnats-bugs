 Do you mean that in ghostview it looks right but on the printer it 
 doesn't? If so, I will look into it, but I am not too hopeful....

Responsible-Changed-Why:

I have narrowed this down to a problem with mred, as I understand it. The
code below does not print properly, as described above, but I think
that it should. Note that this does work under windows (i believe -- 
I am window-less at the moment, but I developed it under windows
some long time ago)

(define (get-date-string) "today")
(define tmp-date-string "")

(define t%
  (class text% ()
    (rename [super-on-paint on-paint])
    (override
      [on-paint
       (lambda (before dc left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret)
         (when (and before
                    (or (is-a? dc post-script-dc%)
                        (is-a? dc printer-dc%)))
           (set! tmp-date-string (get-date-string))
           (let-values ([(w h d s) (send dc get-text-extent tmp-date-string)])
             (send (current-ps-setup) set-editor-margin 0 (inexact->exact (ceiling h)))))
         (super-on-paint before dc left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret)
         (when (and (not before)
                    (or (is-a? dc post-script-dc%)
                        (is-a? dc printer-dc%)))
           (send dc draw-text (get-date-string) 0 0)
           (void)))])
    (sequence 
      (super-init))))

(define t (make-object t%))
(let loop ([n 100])
  (unless (zero? n)
    (send t insert "a")
    (send t insert #\newline)
    (loop (- n 1))))
(send t print)

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed in 102/13 by adding margins to all PS output (configurable via
ps-setup%).
