	The description of the style flag is not very clear.
1) how do I say "no flags"
2) what are the various (potentially there) bitmaps used for?

It seems that under motif with the default style arguments, a bitmap is
used and the on-paint method is only called when the canvas resizes, and
under Xt there maybe a bitmap that is used only as a temporary drawing
area.
