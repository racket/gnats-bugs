>Description:
dragging text file over test window (without even dropping) causes crash.
>How-To-Repeat:
open scheme

make a test case that will fail

have the test case results window seperate from drscheme

drag a text file from one place on the desktop to another, have the path of dragging cross that results window.

while still in the air, without having dropped the text file, scheme will crash.

The error it prints in the terminal is:
SIGSEGV fault on 0x4
Aborted
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 19 Oct 2009 10:04:03 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN for the next version.

Thanks for the report!
