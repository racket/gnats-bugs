>Environment:
MacPPC / Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
>Description:
The DrScheme icon, when clicked on a G4 w/ Mac OS 10.3.9, bounces once to show it's loading, then stops.  When bin/drscheme is run from the command line, it gives this error:

dyld: /Users/kmcgrady/Desktop/PLT Scheme v4.0.1/bin/../DrScheme.app/Contents/MacOS/DrScheme Undefined symbols:
PLT_MrEd undefined reference to ___stderrp expected to be defined in /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
Trace/BPT trap
>How-To-Repeat:
Download the 4.0.1 release of DrScheme, doubleclick on DrScheme and/or run bin/drscheme from the command line.  (In our case, the PLT Scheme directory was under ~/Desktop, but the error message appears to have nothing to do with that.)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by cce at Wed, 06 Aug 2008 02:02:20 -0400
Reason>>> Problem with released binary


Responsible changed from "eli" to "mflatt" by eli at Wed, 06 Aug 2008 09:25:22 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew -- I don't know what to do about this, or if
it's worth fixing at all.  Perhaps the best way to deal
with it is to change the web page to reflect the state
(10.4 as a minimum, with a note that you'll need to build
from source on 10.3).



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:35 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
