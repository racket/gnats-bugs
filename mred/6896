>Description:
When building plt-scheme with graphical components on SunOs 5.8 with Sun's workshop CC compiler. wxs_dc.cxx fails to build. This is because a preprocessor symbol USE_GL is not set (I do not have OpenGL installed).

This is due to the Sun C++ compiler being pedantic; because it expects a function returning a (void*) to return something (a void* would be nice). This is AFAICT not a compiler bug.

I don't know if this is something to be reported to PLT or wxWidgets.org. (And I couldn't find a bug reporting page there for some reason).
>How-To-Repeat:
The compiler error is:

"./wxs_dc.cxx", line 2508: Error: "WithContext(wxGL*, void*, void*, int)" is expected to return a value.


The offending function is:

static void *WithContext(wxGL *gl, void *thunk, void *alt_waitable, int eb)
{
#ifdef USE_GL
  return wxWithGLContext(gl, thunk, alt_waitable, eb);
#endif
}


I have (patchily) fiexd it with:

static void *WithContext(wxGL *gl, void *thunk, void *alt_waitable, int eb)
{
#ifdef USE_GL
  return wxWithGLContext(gl, thunk, alt_waitable, eb);
#else
  return NULL;
#endif
}

Although I expect this will bite me in the bum at a later date.
