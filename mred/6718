unknown-platform
>Description:
Note: platform is Windows Server 2003, which is not available in the web for
drop-down.
                                                                                                      
When attempting to print a ProfessorJ file which contains a comment box that is too long to fit on a single page, Dr. Scheme prints only the first page.
Splitting the comment box into several smaller boxes allows it to print
correctly.                                                             

Printer is a network-attached HP LaserJet 4+, using built-in Windows 2003   
drivers.
