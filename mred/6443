Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 04:57:42 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Sat, 03 Apr 2004 23:52:19 -0500
Reason>>> mred (or mzscheme) bug

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:03 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
