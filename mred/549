>Description:
When executing either DrScheme or Mred.exe, my comp will crash, forcing 
me to CRTL-ALT-DEL to cancel the apps.  The other two DOS only apps work 
fine, and previous versions of DrScheme worked fine.  After deleting
the plt directory by accident, I reinstalled DrScheme; however, it
has yet to actually execute successfully.  I have a 200 Mhz pMMX so it 
shouldn't take any longer than 4 secs to run the program. Please 
let me know if there is something I can do to fix this crashing problem.

Thanks,
Ben

State-Changed-Why:

Does it crash in such a way that Dr. Watson starts up? If so, can you
give us the information it has about the crash? (I'm mainly interested
in the stack trace, if there is one.)

Or does it just hang indefinitely? If it just hangs, can you tell me
more about what the screen looks like when it hangs?
