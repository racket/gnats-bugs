>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
(define port 4524)
(define listener (tcp-listen port 1))

(define sema (make-semaphore 0))

(thread
 (lambda ()
   (let-values ([(in out) (tcp-accept listener)])
     (printf "read: ~s~n" (read-line in))
     (close-output-port in)
     (close-input-port out))))

(let-values ([(in out) (tcp-connect "localhost" port)])
  (fprintf out "11~n")
  (close-output-port out)
  (close-input-port in))

;; get this error:
;; tcp-read: error reading (Unknown Error (-1); errno=-1)
;; but it seems like it should just read properly.
;; in any case, the error should be more descriptive!
