>Description:
In the file dialog when a key is pressed (like letter 'a'), all files which do not start with the letter 'a' are removed from the file list. However, if you press backspace to delete the 'a', the files should reappear to synch with the current prefix in the textbox. However, this is not happening.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open file, press a letter, and then backspace... you won't see the window updated when backspace is pressed!

(For some reason I didn't notice this so far.)
The reason that it wouldn't restore the path list is that
after you get some auto-completed text and backspace it
away, you don't want the text to pop up again -- so after
a backspace it would disable everything.  I've now made it
disable only the auto-completion part (so no text shows up
again after you remove it), but the (re-)filtering is done
as usual.
