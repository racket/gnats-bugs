>Description:
19 of 22 installations of DrScheme v 203 in my Mac lab do not allow File/Save or Save As to work.  We're consistently using Mac OS 9.2.2 on a variety of models (iMac, eMac, and G4 hardware of varying speeds). The 3 working machines are 1 each of 3 different models, so hardware shouldn't be the issue.  I've unsuccessfully tried to fix by un-install & re-install on 1 iMac and 1 eMac.  All other software functions appear to work properly, but when we try to save anything, there is only a brief screen "blink" ... no pop-up window allowing user to name file or specify save location.  Cursor returns to previous location (software does not hang) without creating a file (of any name) saved anywhere.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Is there a known fix or preventative?

>How-To-Repeat:
With any valid code in the Definitions window, click "Save" button, or select File/Save, or select File/SaveAs... or select File/SaveDefinitions.
