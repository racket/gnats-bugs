	The /home directory for our local-area network currently contains
1623 subdirectories.  If a user, in the process of opening a file,
attempts to use the ``Select file'' (in the frame entitled ``Get file'')
to change to /home, DrScheme crashes, writing the following message to
standard error:

Error: XfwfSetScrollbar called with incorrect arguments

>How-To-Repeat:
	Select Open from File menu, use Select file to change to a
directory with zillions of subdirectories.

 Thanks for the problem report. I once knew about this bug (overflow in
 the list widget), but I'd lost track of it. I'll fix it before the next
 release.
