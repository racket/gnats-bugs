>Release:        50s1
>Environment:
MS Windows 95
>Description:
Using the Emacs style Move-Back key, C-b, does nothing. This problem can
be seen under both windows 95 and windows nt 4.0 - sorry don't have any
other platforms to test under.

Please note that I have turned off the _Enable keybindings in menu_ so
that should be making no difference.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type anything you like, and then try and back up over it using C-b.
Alternatively try positioning the cursor anywhere and using the C-b key
to move backwards.

Note, you have to disable menu keybinding to get any of the emacs style
keys to work.

This works on our windows machines. Do you have a non-standard setup?

 You are right; that's a problem with the "keybindings in menus" option.
 
 Thanks for the report!
