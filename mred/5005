>Description:
When the small-sd below change the font size to 1,
typing in the lhs editor doesn't show anything.
when the small-sd below changes the font size to 2,
typing in the lhs editor makes the rhs editor mimic
the lhs one.

(in the first case, resizing the window makes things
update properly, but just typing does not)
>How-To-Repeat:
(define small-sd (make-object style-delta% 'change-size 1))
(define delegate-text%
  (class text%
    (init-field delegate)
    (inherit split-snip find-snip get-snip-position)
    (define/override (after-insert start len)
      (send delegate begin-edit-sequence)
      (split-snip start)
      (split-snip (+ start len))
      (let loop ([snip (find-snip (+ start len) 'before)])
        (when snip
          (unless ((get-snip-position snip) . < . start)
            (send delegate insert (send snip copy) start start)
            (loop (send snip previous)))))
      (send delegate change-style small-sd  start (+ start len))
      (send delegate end-edit-sequence))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define t (make-object text%))
(define d (instantiate delegate-text% ()
            (delegate t)))
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400 600))
(define hp (make-object horizontal-panel% f))
(define ecd (make-object editor-canvas% hp d))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% hp t))
(send ec min-width 100)
(send ec stretchable-width #f)
(send f show #t)

Reason>>> Text in font size 1 seems to have width 0 under OS X, but
updating is consistent.
