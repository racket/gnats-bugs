>How-To-Repeat:
(define d (make-object 
              (class dialog% ()
                (override
                  [can-close?
                   (lambda ()
                     (printf "can-close? ~n"))]
                  [on-close
                   (lambda ()
                     (printf "on-close~n"))])
                (sequence (super-init "dialog")))))
(send d show #t)

;; choose file|close and don't see any printouts.
;; typing esc works properly, tho.
