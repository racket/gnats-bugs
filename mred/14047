 Do you have "libunique"?
 
 (An item on my todo list is to make `racket/gui` complain when
 `-singleInstance` is used but "libunique" is not installed.)

 Bah, I missed that flip -- yes, I didn't have it, and installing it
 makes it work again.

 OK, I'll leave this PR open then as a reminder.
 
 Also, there's the issue of switching to have it on by default, since I
 get the feeling that most applications these days do that.  It's
 obviously questionable to do the switch for people who don't expect it
 as a default (like me...) but I think that a very nice way to deal
 with it now is to make the .desktop file name it, so people who use
 menus or whatever other GUI get the behavior they expect.

Reason>>> Fixed error reporting and added `-singleInstance` to ".desktop" file
