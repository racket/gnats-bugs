Architecture: i586

>Description:

The center method of a frame does not center the frame. This _does_ work
for dialogs.

Possibly this is an interaction with fvwm. I hvae these two lines in my
.fvwm95rc file:

Style "*" RandomPlacement
Style "*" SmartPlacement

Quit now and run DrScheme to get a better window.
The current input port always returns eof.

State-Changed-Why:

Your window manager seems to override all explicit positioning of
unshown frames, whether through `center' or `move'. After a frame is
displayed, it can be moved, but if the frame is hidden and re-shown,
the window manager picks a new position for it.

It makes sense to me that fvwm would have a mode where it ignores the
desried position of frames, but not of dialogs (the WM can see the
difference).
