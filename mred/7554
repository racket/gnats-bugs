>Description:
If I create a file and then embed some images in it, I cannot subsiquently re-open the file and edit it. When I do, I get this error message:
"insert-file in text%: error loading the file"
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Create a file.
2) Embed a bitmap image in it.
3) Save the file.
4) Quit Dr. Scheme.
5) Re-open the file.
6) Edit the textual content of the file.
7) Save the file again.
8) Quit Dr. Scheme.
9) Try to re-open Dr. Scheme.
10) Notice the error message.

 Under Windows, just inserting a comment box, saving the file, and
 trying to load it is enough for me.
 
 The Windows-specific bug was obvious, and it is now fixed in SVN. The
 bug was introduced between 299.100 and 299.200. I don't understand why
 it took so long to uncover; I would expect this bug would prevent all
 DrScheme-format (i.e., non-text) files from working under Windows, but
 apparently it doesn't matter sometimes.
 
 [Some of you reported Windows DrScheme file problems that looked to me
 like a CRLF-conversion problem. I was right about that, but the bad
 CRLF conversion originated in MrEd.]
 
 The repair is a change to a single line of collects/mred/private/editor:
 
    [text? (not (memq actual-format '(text text-force-cr)))])
 
 Obviously, the `not' shouldn't be there.
 
 This is a pretty serious bug for 299.200. We should at least release a
 patch. Should we release 299.300?

 I have seen a similar problem with Mac tabs while I was in Germany.
 
 I tried to open an existing, working file with boxes as a tab in 
 drscheme when I had 3 or 4 other tabs open. It failed and showed 
 gobbledimumble. So I opened a second drscheme and ran it from there.
 
 I can't reconstruct it with small files yet.

 I believe Matthew found one bug here, but it was windows-specific, iirc.
