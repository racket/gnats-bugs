>Description:
I ran two programs, both on cupertino and on sun. This is the first:

  (define (f n) (cond [(zero? n) (void)] (else (f (- n 1)))))
  (time (f (expt 10 6)))

on mac:

  cpu time: 2100 real time: 2100 gc time: 0

on sun:

  cup time: 1510 real time: 1511 gc time: 0

The second program is listed below. On mac:

  cpu time: 14217 real time: 14217 gc time: 1066

on sun:

  cpu time: 3530 real time: 4054 gc time: 210

What explains this descrepency?
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (func)
  
  (define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400 400))
  (define t (make-object text%))
  (define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
  
  (define b (make-object button% "search" f
              (lambda x
                (thread
                 (lambda ()
                   (let ([str "defghijkl"])
                     (let loop ([count 10])
                       (unless (zero? count)
                         (let loop ([start 0])
                           (let ([f (send t find-string str 'forward start 'eof #t #f)])
                             (when f
                               (loop (+ start (string-length str))))))
                         (loop (- count 1)))))
                   (printf "done~n"))))))
  
  
  (let loop ([i 10000])
    (cond
      [(zero? i) (void)]
      [else
       (send t insert
             (format "abcdefghijklmnopqst~n") 
             (send t last-position)
             (send t last-position))
       (loop (- i 1))]))
  
  
  (send f show #t))
