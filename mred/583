>Description:

When a frame is created with a button, the button doesn't appear until the
frame is resized. This doesn't happen with all frames, but it happens
everytime with the code below.

>How-To-Repeat:

(define (f x) (unless (zero? x) (f (- x 1))))
(define (cb) 
  (printf "starting~n")
  (f 100000)
  (printf "ending~n"))
(define frame (make-object wx:frame% null "test" 100 100 100 100))
(define panel (make-object wx:panel% frame))
(define button (make-object wx:button% panel (lambda x (cb)) "button"))
(send frame show #t)

The actual callback is not useful here.

State-Changed-Why:

Fixed and released to exp. The problem was that the panel didn't
automatically size itself to fill the frame, so the button was hidden
in a 0-sized panel. The frame automtaically resized the panel when it
was resized.
