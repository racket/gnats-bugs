>Description:
If a text in an editor canvas has the focus, disabling the 
editor-canvas it appears in does not prevent the user from typing
in that window.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define my-frame (make-object frame% "frame-title" #f 300 300))
(define my-editor-canvas (make-object editor-canvas% my-frame))
(define my-text (make-object text%))

(send my-editor-canvas set-editor my-text)
(send my-frame show #t)

(sleep/yield 4)
(printf "disabling now...~n")
(send my-editor-canvas enable #f)

; start typing in the window while it's still enabled.
; keep typing after the window is disabled
