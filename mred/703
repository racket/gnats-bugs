>Description:
mred -w ... produces this out here:
default-load-handler: cannot open file for input: "xxx/spidey.ss" (2)
where xxx is the current directory.
Apparently, the load-relative in system.ss does not do the
Right Thing.









BTW: The AIX Motif distribution does not really look like it uses Motif ...

 I think the following change in system/system.ss will
 allow spidey.ss to load:
 
 <               ((load (build-path (collection-path "system") "spidey.ss"))
 <                output-spidey-file
 <                app-collection
 <                info))

 >                                            info))

Fixed as above. Actually, used require-library instead of build-path.
