>Description:
I started up DrScheme in a directory where I don't have write
privileges.  After several minutes DrScheme reported that it was
unable to save a file.
Problem 1: The window just said "Error" in its title, not "DrScheme
Error", so I couldn't be 100% sure it was DrScheme's error message.
Problem 2: I had no idea what it was talking about anyway.
_After_ clicking on Ok, it then popped up a very useful box explaining
that it couldn't save the autosave file, and was thus turning off
autosaving.
Problem 2': These two boxes appeared in the wrong order.

Presumably the former box comes from some lower-level system (MrEd
layer?) and the latter from DrScheme's layer.  However, this is still
a bad user interface.
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be easily repeatable.

 Shriram: One from wx, one from mred. 
 
 Matthew: Is there anyway to elimintate the error message box? Perhaps the
 best thing is a predicate that would test if load file is going to open
 that box? I don't see anything in the documentation that mentions that
 little dialog.

Responsible-Changed-When: Tue Oct 21 12:01:18 1997
Responsible-Changed-Why:
I got rid of the error box. Since load-file and save-file return
a status, an error box can be displayed by the client as necessary.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 22 10:00:30 1997
State-Changed-Why:
After further thought, eliminating the error box doesn't seem like the
right approach. Instead, I added a new boolean argument to
`load-file', `save-file', and `insert-file' (now all generalized to
buffers) that indicates whether error dialogs should be shown. The
default is #t, which shows the dialogs. This change has been released.
