 Quoting robby@cs.rice.edu:

 JFYI, It's actually canvases with a negative client size that get it
 wrong. For example, the following code works:
 
 (define size 100)
 (define frame (make-object frame% "frame" #f 20 20)) ; <<<<
 (define canvas
   (make-object (class canvas% ()
 		 (inherit get-dc)
 		 (override
 		  [on-paint
 		   (lambda ()
 		     (send (get-dc) draw-ellipse 0 0 size size))])
 		 (sequence
 		   (super-init frame '(border))))))
 (send frame reflow-container) ; <<<<<
 (send canvas min-client-width size)
 (send canvas min-client-height size)
 (send frame show #t)
 
 The same problem caused all the set-line-count problems. I should have
 added a `get-border-size' method long ago to fix these problems.
