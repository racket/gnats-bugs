>Description:
DrScheme will not run under linux if Xinerama is enabled on the display. Xinerama is used to bind two screens into one for a multi-monitor desktop.
I've tried this under Redhat 9 and Slackware 9.1

The initialization dialog appears, but DrScheme crashes on the third icon (i'm guessing this is when the main window is drawn)

When DrScheme crashes, it returns
"X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  152 (RENDER)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  4 (RenderCreatePicture)
  Serial number of failed request:  4171
  Current serial number in output stream:  4190"

For anyone else with this problem, there is a workaround: use VNC server and client to VNC into your own machine. The VNC server is only a single screen, and therefore does not use Xinerama.

The environment field of this report will be somewhat incorrect, as i am using VNC right now to submit a bug report.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run DrScheme under XFree86 version 4.3.0 (and probably others) with Xinerama enabled (with Option "Xinerama" in the server layout section)

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
