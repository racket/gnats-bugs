 Certain primitives in MrEd are marked as "virtual only". This became
 compiled the wrong way years ago, and the result is that a super call
 to a overridden "virtual only" ends up in a loop.
 
 For now, you can avoid the problem by not calling `super-resized'; it
 doesn't do anything. In fact, none of the broken methods do anything
 (because that's what "virtual only" means).
