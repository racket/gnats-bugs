>Environment:
MS Windows 98
>Description:
Keyboard navigation of the system menus in MDI children leads to
a crash if neither the child nor parent contains a non-empty menu bar.

The crash occurs within the Windows OS, which suggests that
a menuless MDI arrangement is simply not permitted. (Normally,
an MDI application *should* have a "Windows" menu, but the documentation
doesn't seem to say that the menu is required to avoid crashes.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create MDI parent
Create MDI child
Alt-Space to access system menu
Right right arrow twice

State-Changed-Why:
Interestingly, the crash doesn't occur in Windows 2000.
So, not that it's much help, maybe it really is best
understood as a Windows bug.

Reason>>> Update (01/2005): Still a problem in Windows 95
with version 299.27. This looks hopeless for Windows
95/98/Me and irrelevant to most Windows users,
so I'll suspend the PR.
