Compiling the source on Suse Linux 10.2 64-bit edition obtains the following error:

./.libs/libmred.so:  undefined reference to 'XftNameUnparse'

This is keeping me from running Dr. Scheme on this platform.

 That's a problem with the Xft installation. See also
 
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2006-December/020326.html
 
 If upgrading/patching Xft isn't an option, you can work around the
 problem by configuring with --disable-xft. (The font in DrScheme will
 be worse, of course.)
