>Description:
I was trying to print my "Interactions" box and clicked on the Print definitions option by mistake.  I was then given an error message.  The program then proceeded to quit, along with erasing my code.  That's not too exciting to a new Computer Science student already frustrated with an language they have never used before and can't figure out how to use as there seems to be no instruction manual!!!!!
