>Description:
Dear Lambdaheads,

In COMP 210 here at Rice we've had several students who have attempted 
to submit DrScheme files for their homework assignments, only to find 
that neither they (nor we) can re-open the file.  It is nominally in 
DrScheme's binary "multimedia" format, but unfortunately the Dr is unable 
to recover data from the file: [v299.400]

> insert-file in text%: error loading the file

It is possible that inquisitive students have inserted unusual non-text
data into their files, which will prompt a silent change to the 
binary file format; however, in practice this seems to be a feature that
causes trouble for our students.

Example: http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dsandler/tmp/corrupted.scm.gz

[Is there some tool we can use to attempt to recover data from these files?
the binary format is opaque to us.]
>How-To-Repeat:
We're not sure what the exact procedure is.  Clearly, the 
student does something to convince DrScheme that the multimedia
format should be used; since the "Notify when file format changes"
feature is off by default, the student is unaware that this is 
happening.  For some students this binary file continues to work 
correctly; however, for several students, neither the student nor
the grader is able to open or in any way recover this file using 
DrScheme.

 Are you sure that the students used 299.400?  It was released very
 recently due to a bug in 299.200 that has caused such errors.

 Emacs could do it, if you open the file with `find-file-literally',
 and use C-q to enter control characters.  Perhaps some simple utility
 like `dos2unix' would also work.

 Dan, it's admirable that you guys switched to v299.400 but as the 
 announcement says, it's not for teachers and students of HtDP (yet).
 
 We are using it at NU, too, but I have warned my students that they are 
 using technology from the cutting edge and that they are going to cut 
 themselves.
 
 I recommend rolling back to 209, as much as I hate to see you guys not 
 use the fun stuff, of world animations etc.
 
 Thanks for submitting the warning and bug report. We're about to 
 experience the same stuff up here.

 I suspect that some of our students are using the bleeding-edge  
 version on their personal computers instead of v209.  This is our  
 fault; we didn't explicitly tell our students to stay away from the  
 alphas.
 
 I updated to v299.400 in an attempt to read the file.

 I thought this might be the case, but was unable to munge the  
 linefeeds into a file that DrScheme would ingest.

 I also tried various incantations of "tr"; the Dr was not happy with  
 any of these.  What technique did you use to fix the file?
 
 Thanks for your prompt and helpful replies.

 Well, what I use is Emacs -- open and replace every `C-m C-j' with
 `C-j'.  To enter these things into replace I use C-q.  I do this after
 opening the file with `find-file-literally' since without it Emacs
 won't show the ^Ms.
 
 (I will close this bug now)
