 The bug is that console.ss messes up the parameterization branch
 handler:
 
 	    (with-parameterization user-parameterization
 	      (lambda ()
 		(port-read-handler this-in (lambda (x) (transparent-read)))
 		(parameterization-branch-handler 
 		 (lambda () (make-parameterization user-parameterization)))))))))
 
 I'll leave the PR unclaimed.

I removed the offending expression in console.ss (didn't release it) and
tried the same expression again. It still gives the wrong answer:

     #<primitive:default-exit-handler>

I have changed the responsibility to you, since I don't see any other hooks 
that could change this behavior. However, just to be sure, I created a new
system containing only this code:

     (define p (make-parameterization))
     (display (parameterization-branch-handler))
     (newline)
     (display
      (with-parameterization p
	(lambda ()
	  (let ([my-eh
		 (lambda (x)
		   (display "hi")
		   (newline))])
	    (exit-handler my-eh)
	    (wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace))
	    (with-parameterization (wx:eventspace-parameterization
				    (wx:current-eventspace))
	      (lambda ()
		(exit-handler)))))))
     (newline)

     (define mred:initialize (lambda x (exit)))

and then ran it:

     [Thu 11 Dec] ~/plt> mred -robby -s tmp
     #<primitive:eventspace-parameterization-branch-handler>
     #<primitive:default-exit-handler>
     [11:47am] ~/plt> 

and you still see the error. 9I actually originally got the wrong response
in mzos, where console.ss isn't even run.

 For some reason, wx:make-eventspace gets a new parameterization from
 the branch handler and then installs (in that parameterization) a new
 branch handler that creates parameterizations from the eventspace's
 parameterization.
 
 I suspect that this behavior should have been deleted when we changed
 the default branch handler. Unless further thought suggests otherwise,
 I'll delete this behavior for the next release.
