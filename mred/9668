>Description:
The "Checkers" board game pieces do not move or otherwise react when clicked or dragged with a mouse.  The board draws the initial state correctly, and reacts properly to moused state changes in the "Textured" box.  Mousing in the gl-board% proper, however, is apparently ignored.

This might be probably a Windows-only bug, as a query on IRC got a "works for me on linux" reponse.  Windows XP SP3.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run PLT Games.exe, then select "Checkers" from the third column.

OR

#lang
(require games/checkers/checkers)
(invoke-unit game@)

Try to drag a game piece.

 This is almost certainly a shortcoming in the opengl support on the 
 video of the Dell D630 that originally manifested the problem.  Similar 
 systems with different video hardware do not reproduce the problem.
 
 If I can find a way to detect the shortcoming in software, I'll submit a 
 patch.  Until then, might as well close this bug.
