>Description:
After downloading and unpacking the 201 PLT scheme distrbution under MacOS,
I click on the Setup PLT icon.  It launches and MrEd flashes in the application menu.  After about a second it exits, apparently without doing anything.

MacOS 9.0
128MB memory.
No other applications running.

Acutally, this has happened in both of my Mac's.

Thank you for such a nice scheme implementation.

 I can confirm what 3 bug reports have pointed out: running Setup PLT 
 on Mac OS Classic is broken.  In particular, I observe the following 
 sequence of events, when booted into OS 9:
 
 1) unpack distribution
 2) double-click on Setup PLT
 ... Setup PLT immediately halts, and no other applications are running.
 3) double-click on MrEd
 ... Takes about 30 seconds, but MrEd starts up.
 4) Quit MrEd
 5) double-click on Setup PLT
 ... This time, MrEd starts up, and runs GLACIALLY.  TECTONICALLY, 
 even.  After five minutes, it's on the third collection.
 
 I can repeat this sequence ad nauseam (and believe me, I became quite 
 nauseated) by trashing the plt folder, emptying the trash, and 
 starting again at step 1.
 
 I'm afraid this may be grounds for yanking the 201/2 distributions 
 from the web site.
 
 Ideas?

 Aha. That's puzzling, but it gives me something to work with. I guess
 I could never duplicate this problem because I always create the
 initial Setup PLT by running MrEd.
 
 Meanwhile, if the run-MrEd-once trick works consistently, maybe we can
 simply update the installation instructions?

 Yes, but by the time you get to the third collection, you've already
 compiled many other collections --- including mzlib, mred, and the
 framework --- due to the transitive closure of the `require's relation.
 
 I'm not sure why it's so much slower than OS X on certain tasks.
 Something to do with the filesystem, possibly. I sped up the install
 process greatly by avoiding fopen() and fread(), but it's only worth so
 much work to support OS 8/9.

 I just checked cdw.com and macwarehouse.com, and they don't even sell
 pre-OS X operating systems these days.
 
 Do we want to support Classic for v203?

 Yes, I think so. There are many macs out there that cannot upgrade. I
 wish we could support as far back as 7.5.5, frankly.... (I'm sure
 that's unreasonable, but it's my dream :)

 Well, yeah, but a full and stand-alone version of OS 9 is probably 
 still bundled with OS X installation CDs.  Also, it's not about 
 what's being sold, it's about what's being used (particularly in 
 schools.)  That said, I booted into Classic a few days ago and it 
 only took me a few minutes to remember why I hated it so much.  I 
 think that when a major problem (>20 hrs. work?) comes up with the 
 Classic version, we should just pick the most stable recent version 
 and recommend it for all Classic users.

 Neil and Bill:  please try the following workaround for your OS 9 
 DrScheme installation problems, and please let us know whether this 
 works:
 
 In the "plt" folder window, scroll down to MrEd, and start it up by 
 double-clicking.  After it starts up, quit it and _then_ double-click 
 on the Setup PLT application.
 
 Again, please let us know if this workaround resolves the problem.
 
 Thanks for your patience,

 Hi John,
 
 I just downloaded the 202 revision of Dr. Scheme and installed it on my
 system.  I first double clicked on the Mr Ed icon and got the following
 error message:
 
 "The application Mr. Ed has unexpectedly quit, because an error of type 3
 has occurred."  
 
 My current OS version is 8.6 with CarbonLib 1.4. I have 168Mb of RAM and
 close to 3GB of availble memory disk space.
 
 Thanks for helping,
 Bill
