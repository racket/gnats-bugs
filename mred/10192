>Description:
The "open" dialog does not remember the last directory it was in.  This, combined with uncomfortably fast double-click speeds, makes for an altogether harrowing experience trying to open multiple files from one project.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a file in something other than your home directory.
2. Make a new tab.
3. Try to open another file in that same directory.
>Fix:

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:28 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
