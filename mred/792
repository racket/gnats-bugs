This may apply to other UI elements; this is just one instance I'm seeing
consistently.
>How-To-Repeat:
(let* ((frame (make-object mred:frame% null "Test"))
       (panel (make-object mred:vertical-panel% frame))
       (list-box (make-object mred:list-box% panel null null
			      wx:const-single
			      -1 -1 -1 -1
			      '("AAAAAAAAAAAA" "BBBBBBBBBB"))))
  (send frame show #t))

Now, enlarge the frame in the horizontal direction and then (not taking your finger
off the button) make it smaller than the original.  No redraw happens out here.

 Is this the Motif or non-Motif variant?

 Are you using a window manager where the resize is applied immediately
 (as opposed to dragging a dotted box and only resizing when you let
 go)?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
