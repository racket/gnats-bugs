>Description:
`enable' is a method of wx:window% that accepts one argument,
but wx:radio-box% overrides `enable' with a procedure that
accepts either 1 or 2 arguments. mred:radio-box% apparebtly
verrides `enable' again with a procedure that only accepts
1 argument, but it should accept 2.
>How-To-Repeat:
in MrEd:
> (load/cd "plt/tests/mred/item.ss")
; Click on "Make Big Frame"
; Uncheck "Enable Radio Item `First'"
; (The error message currently goes to stderr, which
;  is an already-reported bug)
