>Description:
Modal dialogs created by 
get-file and message-box don't
appear to always become the active
window under Windows.  

Maybe this is by design.

While they're not system-modal, they
are application-modal, so I think they
should become the active window.  
In one of Carol's MysterX applications,
a message-box sometimes shows up only in the 
taskbar, which is easy to miss.
>How-To-Repeat:
(get-file ...)

or

(message-box ...)

Responsible-Changed-Why:

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:35:19 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
