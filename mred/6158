>Description:
the placement of the collection-paths text in the
language details box is skewed way to the left on a 
re-open when details have been changed.  

looks like a list-box problem, probably having to do
with sub-panel embedding... might require a change to
the a-list code. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.
Select Language:Choose Language...
click the "Show Details" button.
Make a RHS change... say, check "Show Sharing in Values" (for the module language).
Click OK.
Now, select Language:Choose Language... again.
OUCH: text of Collection Paths list box appears about
200 pixels to the left.

    Fixed. (You were right, of course, about the sub-panel embedding.
    wxListBox needed to override MaybeMoveControls().)
