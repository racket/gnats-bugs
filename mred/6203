>Description:
The version of the change-style method on style%s for text% objects
seems to be broken, at least under OS/X. That is, it doesn't seem to
actually change the style.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (instantiate frame% () (label "Test") (width 400) (height 400)))
(define pasteboard (instantiate pasteboard% ()))
(define ec (instantiate editor-canvas% () (parent frame) (editor pasteboard)))
(define text (instantiate text% () (auto-wrap #t)))
(define snip (instantiate editor-snip% () (editor text)))
(send pasteboard insert snip)
(send frame show #t)
(send text insert "Here's some text")
(define base-style (send the-style-list basic-style))
(define delta (make-object style-delta% 'change-normal-color))
(send delta set-delta-foreground "Red")
(define red-style (send the-style-list find-or-create-style base-style delta))
(send text change-style red-style 0 'end #t)
;; the above doesn't seem to do anything at all
(send text change-style delta 0 'end #t)
;; but this latter one does

 The problem has to do with style lists, which are editor-specific. In
 each place where you use `the-style-list' below, use `(send text
 get-style-list)' instead.
 
 The documentation for `change-style' warns that the style must be in
 the editor's style list, but only in one case of the method. In
 particular, the warning is missing for the case you use below. I'll fix
 that.
