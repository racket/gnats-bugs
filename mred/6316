>Description:
cutting text containing an XML box while inside a scheme box inside another
XML box causes crash.

It's possible that the following sequence of steps is not the minimal 
required.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Insert XML box
enter abc def
in the space, insert a scheme box
enter (string-append "ghi")
in the space, insert an xml box
enter "jkl"
Now use the mouse to highlight the scheme expression (from the '(' to the ')')
Now hit cmd-x
Bang!

    Fixed for the next exp-tagging.
    
    The bug was a leftover from early attempts at manual
    memory management. It looks like some style list
    was shared, and copy attempted to clear the
    list of styles, which confused some other use
    of the style list.
