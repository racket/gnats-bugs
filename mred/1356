 You're not the first to report this, though I've seen it myself only 
 once or twice.  Is the problem reliably repeatable, or does it occur 
 only sometimes?  If it's repeatable, can you send me a more detailed 
 set of instructions on how to cause it?  Or is it just opening help 
 desk?
 
 Thanks,
 
 john
