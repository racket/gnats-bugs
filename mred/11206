>Description:
Dialogs (for example, "Bug Report Form") flicker, consume 100% CPU when I resize the window by dragging.
It also queues resizing (or redrawing) so it processes then even after I finish dragging.
>How-To-Repeat:
What should happen:
Controls change their positions cleanly and smoothly, text does not disappear nor flicker in them, application consumes not a lot more CPU (if window is simple) than usual.
New resizes are dropped while previous ones still performing (e.g. not enqueue and draw controls for path the mouse was walked) => stop resizing when user release button immediately.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:45:02 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
