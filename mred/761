v. 53, Linux, downloaded from the Web
>Description:
When DrScheme starts up, the View | Hide Definitions option has a
keyboard shortcut listed on it ("Ctrl+m d").  (There is, for some
reason, no shortcut listed for View | Hide Interactions, though I
recall there being one under Windows.)  Anyway, if you ever choose
Hide Definitions, then a subsequent Show Definitions does not ever
print the shortcut again.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start up DrScheme.
2. Click on View.  Hide Definitions has a keyboard shortcut listed.
3. Choose View | Hide Definitions.
4. Choose View | Show Definitions.
5. Inspect View.  It lists no shortcut.

 This is due to a bug in MrEdEngine, fixed in MrEd 100.
