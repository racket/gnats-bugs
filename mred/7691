>Description:
plt/src/mzscheme/configure.ac tests for Xft by first trying xft-config, then checking whether X11/Xft/Xft.h can be included. In modular Xorg, however, xft-config has been replaced by pkg-config xft, and just including X11/Xft/Xft.h doesn't work because Xft can't find the freetype headers. Therefore, configure.ac needs to try both pkg-config xft and xft-config.

It should also be noted that the current method of checking whether `xft-config --cflags` gives nonempty output might break on a system where no cflags are necessary to compile with Xft. It should instead check the exit status. The same applies to `pkg-config --cflags cairo` below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to configure --enable-xft on Fedora Core 5:

checking X11/Xft/Xft.h usability... no
checking X11/Xft/Xft.h presence... no
checking for X11/Xft/Xft.h... no
no Xft headers; Xft support disabled

from config.log:
