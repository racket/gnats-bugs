>Description:
The new navigation windows on the mac are nifty in the following way: they remember previous paths chosen from any directory.  This makes it a lot easier to navigate downward along an earlier path.  

Of course, there may be issues regarding backward compatibility, but the way I think it _might_ work is that you link with a set of libraries which invoke the earlier file dialogs if the newer ones are not available.

Granted, this is _not_ a high priority request.
