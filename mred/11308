Open up drracket, click a menu item such as 'File'. Then move the mouse to other menu items horizontally so that the sub-menu's pop open, like to 'Edit' and 'Insert'. Keep doing this fairly fast and the error might occur (it seems to occur randomnly).

 I've seen his under Windows (so it's good to know that it isn't
 win32-specific), but I'm not able to replicate it.
 
 When you see the crash, does the GC icon flash any time before?

 I tested it a few times (the crash occurs reliably after moving the
 mouse for a few seconds) but did not see the GC icon flash at all.
