>Description:
Since we downloaded the version 2.6p1 of DrSceheme, we have not been able to copy text into it out of any program except TextEdit.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copy any text from any program besides TextEdit; it shows the text as a picture, so we can't edit it at all.

 Seems similar to the previously closed 5256 bug; which as I recall,
 MrEd/WxScheme creates a type (flavor?) of text-clipping, which
 most of my OSX apps other than TextEdit don't know how to deal with.
 
 (as a result, I too find myself occasionally having to paste text
  into TextEdit, from where I copy it again to paste into other apps
  as required, which can be a minor pain; therefore it would be nice
  if MrEd/WxScheme could emulate whatever it is that TextEdit does.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:43 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
