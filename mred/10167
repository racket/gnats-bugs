>Description:
In Mac OS X, it is common for the "two-finger trackpad scrolling gesture" to scroll the contents of the window/widget under the pointer, even when the underlying window/widget is not active.

The DrScheme windows/widgets do not seem to follow this behavior.

If DrScheme is not the active application, and I make the scrolling gesture over one of DrScheme's source-code or REPL panes, the scrolling does not immediately occur.  Instead, it is executed when DrScheme later becomes the active application.

If DrScheme is the active application, and the source-code pane is the selected pane, and I then make the scrolling gesture over the REPL pane, the source-code pane scrolls.  I'm not sure what the Mac UI guideline is in this case, but I find it odd to be "over" one pane and have my gesture scroll another.

In the bug-report form dialog, a similar issue occurs.  The gesture scrolls the text box that is currently selected ("description" or "steps to reproduce"), not the one that the cursor may be over.

I am not an expert inthe Mac UI guidelines.  I only mean to report that as I am starting to DrScheme on my Mac, some of the scrolling actions do not work like I expect them to.  My "expectations" have been conditioned by the way that other Mac applications work, not through study of the actual UI guidelines!

Thanks! ---

Eric.
