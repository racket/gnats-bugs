>Description:
	When I open a non-existant file with mred:edit-file, I can only edit
the new file until an autosave occurs. After the autosave, the buffer is locked.
(I didn't try saving the file.) Note that this situation can't happen by
opening buffers via the menus.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Set autosave delay to 2 seconds
	(mred:edit-file "something-new.ss")
	Type fast! After at most two seconds, the buffer will be locked
>Fix:
