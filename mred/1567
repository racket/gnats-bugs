>Description:
Now, the bug report -- there's a bug in the "Add Files..." menu for
Projects. For whatever reason, adding a file under NT just doesn't work.
Under some conditions, I can get it to add files, but the 'raw' version
is incorrect.

More specifics:

- Just selecting a file with the cursor results in no file added.
- Selecting multiple files (using the SHIFT or Ctrl keys), adds files to
the list, but their path is wrong. For example, a file

D:\Work\cera\utils\common-time.scm

is added to the project list as:

"D:\\Work\\cera\\utilscommon-time.scm"

That is, the last directory separator is missing.

I'm able to work around this if I manually type "\common-time.scm" into
the file dialog box. But typing in the complete pathname in the file
manager, e.g.,

"D:\Work\cera\utils\common-time.scm"

results in a 'normalize-path' error message:

normalize-path: "D:\\Work\\cera\\utilsD:" (within the input path) is not
a directory or does not exist

 FWIW, this appears to be a bug in mred's get-file-list under NT (if you
 hadn't already figured that out :)

Fixed. Somehow I had underestimated Microsoft's ability to produce
a severely contorted and poorly documtned interface.
