>Description:
Student work is not compiling to executables in my school's lab (running DrScheme 4.1 on Vista).  "Create Executable" produces the following error:
"copy-directory/files: encountered C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\mzlib\icons/file.gif, neither a file nor a directory

 === context ===
C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\compiler\distribute.ss:392:28: loop
C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\compiler\distribute.ss:368:4: loop
core"
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's a simple file that fails when compiled in the student languages:

;; ------
;; Use world.ss teachpack.

(define W 200)
(define H 200)
(define DOT (circle 5 'solid 'red))
(define BKG (empty-scene W H))

;; world = posn
(define (next w) (make-posn (random 200) (random 200)))

(define (render w)
  (place-image DOT (posn-x w) (posn-y w) BKG))

;; Run:
(big-bang W H 1/10 (make-posn 100 100))

(on-redraw render)

>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:31 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
