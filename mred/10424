>Description:
The files created by DrScheme in OS X have the file type "TXET" and the
creator "cSrD".  I conjecture the following:
a) we really want these to be "TEXT" and "DrSc".
b) this is an endianness issue.
In particular, I happen to know that historically, these four-char codes
were encoded as 32-bit ints, and that a change from a big-endian (PPC)
machine to a small-endian one could account for this problem.

I suppose it's actually possible that this is a deliberate decision, but 
it doesn't seem likely. I suppose it's also possible that GetFileInfo
is "getting it wrong" w.r.t. the OS X standards, but my assumption is
that the apple-supplied binaries are "getting it right".
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme. Type some new chars in a file. Save it as /tmp/foo.ss.

In the terminal, run GetFileInfo:

pcp062805pcs:/tmp clements$ /Developer/Tools/GetFileInfo foo.ss
file: "/private/tmp/foo.ss"
type: "TXET"
creator: "cSrD"
