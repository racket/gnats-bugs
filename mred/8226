>Description:
I believe this is a documentation bug.  The documentation of editor-canvas%'s on-scroll method claims it is called when the user changes manual scrollbars, but not automatic scrollbars.  I don't believe editor canvas has manual scrollbars, they are always automatic.  Hence the method is never called, and probably only exists due to inheritance from canvas% or a related superclass.

As a separate note, it would be convenient if something like on-scroll were still called by automatic scrollbars, if only to allow other objects to react to the event.

Reason>>> I moved on-scroll out of canvas<%> and into canvas%.
