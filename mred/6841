MrEd crashes after the PLT tree has been installed. A window with a text area pops up saying, "Installing PLT Scheme" or something to that effect. A window asking if I want to send an error report to Microsoft appears. The first install window behaves normally, and asks if I want to run DrScheme. However, neither the DrScheme nor the HelpDesk executable appears.

1. Download the installer for Windows XP.
2. Run the installer.

 This is a bug that we did not find so far.  There are several things
 that you can try -- one is to run the installer without an internet
 connection, andother is to run install.bat in the PLT directory which
 should already exist after this crash.
