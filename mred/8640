>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
I open a Scheme source file in DrScheme, then minimize its window (under MacOS).  I then double-click one or more other Scheme source file(s) in the Finder, and instead of opening those files, DrScheme un-minimizes the minimized window.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 02:39:21 -0400
Reason>>> sounds like mred, but maybe drscheme


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 08 May 2007 02:57:28 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. The problem was a bug in the
default application-file handler, which did
not ignore a hidden frame that is used to drive
the menubar when no other frame is shown and
non-minimized.
