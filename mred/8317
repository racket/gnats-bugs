>Description:
When adding an image to a document with text in it, the program will intermitently terminate without saving data or warning the user.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a document with a program in it.  Attempt to add an image to the document using the "special: add image" command. then select "desktop" and use the curser/keys to search for the image that you want.  My program is crashing randomly at this step.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:36 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
