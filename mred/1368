>Description:
On the macintosh, when a choice% item is named "--" it comes out
as a separator, but under unix it does not. I prefer the mac
behavior and would like to see it carried over to unix, if that
is possible (and windows, too).

Also, there are probably other mac-based escape characters that
make funny things happen in menus (of course, only on the mac)
