anything.

evaluate this. Look at frame and look at ghostview preview. (printer also
doesn't work)

			   (inherit get-dc)
			   (public
			     [on-paint
			      (lambda ()
				(draw-in-dc (get-dc)))]))
			 f))
(send f set-size 0 0 300 300)

(define black-pen (send wx:the-pen-list find-or-create-pen
			"BLACK" 1 wx:const-solid))
(define gray-brush (send wx:the-brush-list find-or-create-brush
		       "GREY" wx:const-solid))

      (set-pen black-pen)

      (draw-line 100 100 135 10)
      (draw-line 10 10 135 10))))

(send f show #t)
