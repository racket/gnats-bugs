>Description:
Caret display is screwed up in the mred:media-edit% and related:
I often don't see a caret at all, and the caret shows up in edits
containing media snips with (hide-caret #t), usually at the beginning.
This has been around since PLT 50, I believe.
>How-To-Repeat:
The behavior is totally unpredictable; the system randomly switches
back and forth between displaying carets and not displaying them.
In one instance, inserting a call to display in an on-focus method
reliably fixes the problem.

 I actually thought that all the caret problems were fixed. I am unable
 to produce bad updating.
 
 As for carets showing up in embedded media buffers, that's actually
 intentional. The caret-hiding state of a buffer is not propagated to
 embedded buffers. Of course, the caret should only show up in an
 embedded buffer when it has the keyboard focus.
 
 If you have embedded buffers in a buffer with its caret hidden, then
 the caret's behavior could appear to be random if the focus is moved
 back and forth from the enclosing and embedded buffers. As the focus
 moves to the enclosing buffer, the caret would disappear. Clicking in
 an embedded buffer would magically bring the caret back.
 
 So, is the real problem a lack of documentation on hide-caret, or is
 something else going wrong?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
