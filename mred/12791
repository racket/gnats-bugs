 Just a note, to say that these problem reports are about the same bug.
 
 http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=12689
 http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=5342
 
 With respect to OS X here is a work-around for copying a bitmap to the
 pasteboard (OS X speak for clipboard). I am unsure what the best of
 integrating this into clipboard.rkt  though.
 
 Documentation for the pasteboard is available here:
 https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PasteboardGuide106/Introduction/Introduction.html

 Why do you say that doesn't work? When I select and copy, I can paste
 the image again just fine.

 Yes, that works on the selection, not on images per se.

 Oh, right. I don't think that has ever worked for 2htdp/image-based images.

 Can you test this with a nightly build?  I believe that this has now been fixed.

 Hi Sam,
 
 Finally got around to testing this, with a fresh download of 5.3, and I still find that "Copy" and "Cut" are greyed-out.
 
 Best,
 Jordan

 Sorry for the delay in following up on this.
 
 Did you select the image or just click on it? (Generally speaking, you
 must select something to copy it in a DrRacket editor.)

 I've cc'd Matthew for this aspect of the PR.
 
 > Regarding the other method -- right-clicking and copying via the context menu -- I understand from your first message that it's not currently intended behavior, but I'd submit that as a feature request, since it is a standard idiom in most of the programs that my students regularly use.
 
 Yeah, I was thinking the same thing (right _after_ I sent the last
 message, naturally). Thanks.
