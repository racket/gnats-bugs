 The docs do say that 'mono only triggers filtering for Windows and X
 (with Xft), but maybe that qualification could be clearer.
 
 As far as I know, the Mac API doesn't offer a way to get a list of
 fixed-width fonts, but I'd be very happy if you can tell me otherwise.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Here is  the  reference you want.  NSFontAttributeExplorer is an Xcode
 project that produces a listing of all fonts and their metrics.  The
 metric your after is FixedPitch, which on my system worked like a charm
 to differentiate the monospaced fonts from the rest of the pack.<br>

 Aha: MrEd is a Carbon application, and I've been looking only at Carbon
 APIs. That seems to be where my problems start. After another search, I
 find advice suggesting that the right thing is to use the Cocoa API for
 fonts, even if not for anything else.
 
 Does that sound right?

 That's seems like the least distance to our goal?  If you'd like I can
 code up a function that returns an array (or whatever data type works
 best for you) loaded with either all installed font face names or only
 fixed-pitch installed font face names, based on, lets say an int
 argument: ((union (0 1) . -&gt; . arraryof string?).  Just let me know
 if this would help and your preferred naming conventions and your
 preferred argument and return types.<br>
 <br>
 BTW, on a different topic, I'm building a MrEd application called
 LiveRegexp.  Think pattern matching with instant feedback to changes on
 a char by char basis to either a set of `Definitions', the `Match
 Expression' (plt-match and/or pregexp), and/or the `Text to Match'.  At
 present, all three text% objects, and a fourth `Results' text object%,
 have their own dismiss able panel%.  In addition to being able to
 dismiss the panel%, I'd like the user to be able to individually resize
 them in relation to the others.  However, maintaining a particular
 percentage of the applications frame height while using stretchable
 containees has become frustrating in MrEd, as the only classes that you
 can specify an actual, as opposed to minimum height, are
 top-level-window% classes (frame% and dialog%), which I discovered that
 although you can specify a frame% as the parent of another frame% that
 doesn't translate into being contained within the parent frame% (except
 I guess for MDI client frames.)  So, I've started looking at the
 framework% classes, since I know it must be possible there given that
 DrScheme's own definitions and interactions canvas's resize in
 precisely the way I want mine to do.  So, it looks like LiveRegexp will
 become a DrScheme tool, instead of a stand-alone application.  That
 probably works better for my intended user anyway.<br>
 <br>
 During development I've been looking critically at both the MrEd and
 Framework documentation for the first time, and I occasionally run
 across typos and errors.  The usual error I've encountered is an
 init-field listed for a class, which, upon trial, turns out not to
 exist for the class.  I'd like to make it a simple process to report
 them to PLT as well as maintaining my own documentation in a correct
 state.<br>
 <br>
 Do we have access to svn'ing the Tex sources, or whatever format they
 start out in, and the makefile for rebuilding the documentation?  Or
 would it be just as good to simply make the changes to my local html
 files?  Either way, I could quickly make the changes locally on the
 spot, and then periodically send you a diff file, so that the next time
 I download a new installer I'll not clobber all my hard work making
 corrections?  Any suggestions on LiveRegexp or my documentation dilemma
 would be greatly appreciated.<br>
 <br>
 Cheers,<br>

 The source is packaged as a tar file and available here:
 
   http://pre.plt-scheme.org/docs/
 
 It's no fun to try to build from source, though. We've long planned to
 re-write the documentation in a more sensible format, and we might
 actually start on that soon.

 That would be much appreciated. But don't hesitate to just drop a note
 to me (MrEd manual) or Robby (Framework manual) when you find a
 problem.

 I need a bit more to bridge the gap between a font% object and a
 NSFont. Currently, font% actually works in terms of font families plus
 QuickDraw-like styles: bold, italic, etc.  At the moment, we're using
 FMGetFontFromFontFamilyInstance(), but that's deprecated.  I expect we
 should be using something different in Cocoa, but I'm not sure of the
 right approach.
 
 What's the right way to map MrEd's font% system to Cocoa fonts?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Hi Dr. Flatt,
 
 I didn't realize that this had been fixed; I must have missed it on the 
 list.
 
 So, I have 370.3, I'll check if it's fixed on my build.
 
 I've been noticing some problems reported on the list with builds lately; is
 it a good time to get an update and build from it?
 
 Thanks,

 Yes, I think now is a relatively good time.
