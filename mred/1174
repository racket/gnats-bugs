 	analyze a reasonably big file
 	~matthias/Web/311/spidey-test.ss
 	show value set on some id with "large" value set 
 	go to bottom
 	use page-up, page-down, up and down arrows

 I'm guessing this is either a bug in the framework, or possibly a feature.
 It looks like PageUp/PageDown won't scroll to the middle of the 
 snip represented by a value set.
 
 As far as I can tell, Spidey doesn't trap the PageUp/PageDown
 keys, nor override scrolling behavior.  I've asked Cormac if 
 this is correct.
 
 In any case, there's an easy workaround.  Use the Up/Down keys to
 scroll by a couple of lines, then PageUp/PageDown work as expected.

 The work-around doesn't work. You can move the scroll-bar with the mouse,
 but that's very inconvenient.

 For the record, I doubt that this has anything to do with the
 framework. I suspect mred (since the framework doesn't do anything
 with either pgup and pgdown or snips) has a problem with large snips.
 The best thing is to try to narrow it down to a small program that
 takes spidey out of the loop.

 This is not a Spidey bug, but looks to be a MrEd bug.  Matthew,
 do you want to take over this PR?
 
 The following program tickles the bug:
 
     (define txt (make-object text%))
     (define frame (make-object frame% "test" #f 500 500))
     (define canvas (make-object editor-canvas% frame txt))
     (send frame show #t)
 
     (define snip (make-object editor-snip%))
     (define snip-edit (make-object text%))
     (send snip set-editor snip-edit)
 
     (let loop ([n 500])
       (unless (zero? n)
           (send snip-edit insert 
 		(string-append "line" 
 			       (number->string (- 501 n)) 
 			       (string #\newline)))
 	  (loop (sub1 n))))
 
     (for-each
      (lambda (s)
        (send txt insert s))
      (list "preceding text"
 	   (string #\newline)
 	   snip
 	   (string #\newline)
 	   "following text"
 	   (string #\newline)))
 
 In DrScheme, Execute this program.  Scroll all the way to the bottom.
 Now try to use PgUp to get back to the top.  Scrolling stops at 
 the top of the text box.

 Ok. The problem is indeed MrEd's scrolling mechanism.
