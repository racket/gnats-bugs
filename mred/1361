>Description:
I would expect that running the program below, clicking on the canvas,
and selecting the menu item would cause the editor-canvas to have the
focus. This is not the case, however.

Apologies if this is an open pr....
>How-To-Repeat:
(define menu (make-object popup-menu% "menu"))
(define item (make-object menu-item% "item" menu
               (lambda x 
                 (send ec focus))))

(define canvas%
  (class canvas% ()
    (inherit popup-menu)
    (override
      [on-event
       (lambda (evt)
         (when (send evt button-down?)
           (popup-menu menu 0 0)))])
    (sequence
      (super-init frame))))

(define frame (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 100))
(define canvas (make-object canvas%))
(define text (make-object text%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% frame text))

(send text insert "abcdef")
(send text set-position 2 4)

(send frame show #t)
