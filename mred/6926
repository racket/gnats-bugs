>Description:
Trying to open a large file (e.g. mred.ss) in DrScheme on OpenBSD 3.5 [i386] kills window.  CLI message is
	mred: out of memory

Before I go digging into the cause of this, is it a known problem (e.g. interaction with OpenBSD's compiler stack checks)?

Thanks much.

Invoke drscheme.

 "mred.ss" certainly isn't so large that it should give DrScheme
 trouble, normally...
 
 What are your process memory-use limits? (In other words, if you're
 running csh, what does `limit' report?)
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 the "limit" shell/cli command reports:
 
 cpu time		unlimited
 file size		unlimited
 data size		64 MB
 stack size		4 MB
 core dump size	unlimited
 memory use	467 MB
 memory locked	156 MB
 maxproc		128
 descriptors	64
 
 I set data size to 156MB and stack size to 20MB and everything came up 
 peaches. Â [I can now syntax-check kernel.ss].  
 
 The process still dies if I do too much work subsequently (search in HelpDesk 
 killed it afterward).
 
 So a "work-around" exists.  This should be moved to whatever bug class that 
 implies.  A note on usage requirements would be helpful.  [I bought a new 
 computer with more memory just to run DrScheme!].
 
 I suggest tagging this for re-check when the newer ('precise' a.k.a. normal) 
 GC works.
 
 Cheers,
 -KenD
