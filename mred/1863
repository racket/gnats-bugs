>Description:
DrScheme sometimes hangs completely upon output to the REPL;
no redraws, no nothing.  I think it has to do with the *amount*
of output to the REPL, but I'm not sure.
>How-To-Repeat:
Consider the following code.  Type a number into the text field
and press enter.

Things work for small numbers, but, say, for 5000, DrScheme hangs.
This is both vanilla 103 and 103.5d104.

(define frame (make-object frame% "Foo"))

(define text-field
  (make-object text-field% "Bla"
    frame
    (lambda (self event)
      (if (eq? 'text-field-enter (send event get-event-type))
          (let ((n (string->number (send self get-value))))
            (do ((i 0 (+ 1 i)))
              ((= i n))
              (display "Yo!") (newline)))))))

(send frame show #t)

 Observations about this bug:
 
    - mred stops calling waitnextevent on the mac, effectively freezing 
 the entire machine. Should that be possible to do, from Scheme code?
 
    - this does not happen, as far as I can tell, without a text-field. 
 Just running the loop works fine. Queue-ing a callback to do the 
 printout works fine. Clicking a button works fine:
 
    (define frame (make-object frame% "Foo"))
 
    (make-object button% "Bla"
      frame
      (lambda (self event)
        (let ((n 5000))
          (do ((i 0 (+ 1 i)))
            ((= i n))
            (display "Yo!") (newline))
          (display "done"))))
 
    (send frame show #t)
 
 Thus, I suspect that DrScheme is fine. Thus, I hope that you will 
 claim this PR. If code inspection yeilds nothing, send it back to me 
 and I will spend the time to narrow it down for you.

 Probably it's a missing as-exit (lock release) in mred.ss.
