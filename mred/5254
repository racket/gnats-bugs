>Description:
The scroll-event% objects sent to the on-scroll method
of a MrEd canvas% object only give correct positions when
the scroll event is a dragging move.  If the scrollbar
is moved by clicking on the scroll arrow, or by clicking
in the bar to scroll up or down by a page at a time,
the position sent is 0.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define dummy-canvas%
  (class canvas% 
    (override on-scroll)
    (define (on-scroll evt)
      (let ((dir (send evt get-direction))
            (pos (send evt get-position)))
        (printf "~s ~s ~n" dir pos)))
    (super-instantiate () (style '(hscroll vscroll)))
    (send this init-manual-scrollbars 1000 1000 100 100 0 0)))

(define f (make-object frame% "Testing" #f 256 256))
(send f show #t)
(define c (make-object dummy-canvas% f))

;; Drag a scrollbar, notice the printed values.
;; Now move the scrollbars around by clicking, rather than
;; dragging, and notice that the position reported is 0.
