>Description:
I just tried installing Dr Scheme 201 on my iMac running MacOS 8.6.  Clicking on the Setup icon doesn't seem to do anything and I notice that I don't have a Dr Scheme icon like I did with the 103 version.  I think I have plenty of memory, 160Mb, on my machine.  Anyone have any ideas on what wrong?
