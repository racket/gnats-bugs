>Description:
Hi, I'm trying to install DrScheme on my Linux box...  I'm running 
a pretty standard RedHat 5.2 setup.  Trying to run DrScheme always results
in a segmentation fault -- i.e.

[root@dabomb bin]# ./drscheme
Segmentation fault
[root@dabomb bin]# 


No windows come up or anything.  Any suggestions?  It seems like maybe
a conflicting package or something.

MzScheme, DrScheme Jr, etc. all seem to run just fine.

I just install it and try to run it and get a seg. fault.

 Version 53 was compiled for libc5, but Linux distributions now all
 provide lib6. That's almost certainly the problem.
 
 You have two options:
 
  1) Download the 100alpha2 Linux binary, which is at
 
       www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/100alpha2
 
     If your using DrScheme for a class, that's not a good option,
     because version 100alpha2 is not compatible with version 53.
 
  2) Compile your own MrEd binary from the source code on the web page.
     Compiling MrEd is relatively easy for Linux, but it's still a bit
     of a pain.

 Thanks!
 
 In what ways is 100alpha2 incompatible with 53?

 The languages have changed and the library interface (for defining
 libraries used by "Set Library To...") is different.
