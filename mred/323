 (define register-autosave
        ...
	(lambda (b)
	  (set! objects
		(cons (make-weak-box b) objects))))))


The value inside the weak box will indeed be collected. But the list
`objects' will grow to an arbitrarily long list of boxes if autosaving
is turned off.

One solution is to remove empty weak-boxes from the list when
`cons'ing new items. Obviously, this makes autosave registration
O(n^2) in principle, though I doubt it would matter.

Alternatively, you can use a hash table with weak keys. Hash table
"buckets" are automatically removed when a key is collected.
