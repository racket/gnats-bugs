>Description:
	Hitting "cancel" to close the preferences dialog seems to
turn off the GC icon in the status bar. Doesn't happen with "OK".
>How-To-Repeat:
	Run mred with the status line on
	Execute (let loop () (cons 1 2) (loop)) for a while
         (watch the icons blink :)
	Open preferences
	Close preferences with "Cancel"
	Try (let loop () (cons 1 2) (loop)) again
	  (no flashing icon)
