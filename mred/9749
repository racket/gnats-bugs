 When you say "hit copy", do you mean select from the menu bar?
 
 When I use keyboard shortcuts, it works fine. When I select "Paste"
 instead of typing Ctl-Y or Cmd-V, then ESC-Y doesn't work. (But the
 ring is still intact, and I selected the pasted part, paste again with
 a shortcut, and then use ESC-Y.)

 I used the keyboard shortcuts in all three cases (cmd-c, cmd-x, and cmd-v).
 
 Glad to hear that the ring is intact, tho! I"ll try control-y next time.

 Is it possible that you moved the mouse into or out of the canvas
 window between key strokes?
 
 It turns out that selecting a menu behaved differently for me because
 it generated an enter or leave mouse event. (If I positioned the window
 in a different way, I could use the "Paste" menu item and also use
 ESC-Y afterward.)
 
 I've changed `text%' so that it treats enter and leave events like move
 events (i.e., they don't clear the recent-even-was-a-paste flag).

 Maybe that's it! I possibly used alt-tab to switch to another window
 to refer to my instructions.

 Well, cChanging keyboard focus clears the paste state, and I left that
 as-is.

 This isn't new behavior, I take it? I'll keep watching and see if
 there's something else.
 
 Does it make sense for esc-y to do a control-y instead of doing
 nothing in this case?
