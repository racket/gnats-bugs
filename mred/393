>Description:
It seems like mred takes a lot of extra cpu time when there are several
eventspaces around. I created several eventspaces, one per frame and then
just brought each frame to the front, one after another (mildly quickly)
and mred stayed at 20% cpu. 

When I did that with 1 eventspace, it was at about 5% cpu. 

(I originally noticed this in mzos. One countdown and one mred and the cpu
is about 20 percent. However, either one countdown or one mred and the cpu
is negligible)

>How-To-Repeat:

I did this:

(parameterize ([wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace)])
  (mred:edit-file "1.ss"))
(parameterize ([wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace)])
  (mred:edit-file "2.ss"))
(parameterize ([wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace)])
  (mred:edit-file "3.ss"))
(parameterize ([wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace)])
  (mred:edit-file "4.ss"))
(parameterize ([wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace)])
  (mred:edit-file "5.ss"))

and compared with this:

(mred:edit-file "1.ss")
(mred:edit-file "2.ss")
(mred:edit-file "3.ss")
(mred:edit-file "4.ss")
(mred:edit-file "5.ss")

Yes - more eventspaces use extra resources in the same way that more
threads use extra resources (in exactly the same way in this case,
actually, since threads are responsible for the difference). I could
hack in optimizations all day, but there are more worthwhile projects.

 Well, in this case, I think it's more extreme than you realize. MzOS is
 useless, since I can only run one program in it at a time.
 
 In any case this is not the same thing as threads. I also tried my
 experiment (earlier in the pr) with threads. I created about 20 threads
 that sleep 5 and then count down from 1000. Those threads took up no time,
 unlike the 5 eventspaces.
 
 However, I do understand that you have prioities. Perhaps "suspended" is a
 better state than "closed" for this pr.

 I don't understand - 5% to 20% is only a factor of four. The cost
 doesn't seem to be linear in the number of programs, 5 (and I wouldn't
 expect it to be). What happens when you run 10 eventspaces?

 So, my new test is compare several os countdowns doing nothing with several
 mzos countdowns doing nothing. The delay is (sleep 5).
 
 In all of these tests, I didn't touch the computer, I just let it run for a 
 while and looked at top.
 
 With 3 in sunos, the cpu is between 2 and 3% each. Also, with 10 in sunos,
 each is between 2 and 3 percent each.
 
 mzos:
 countdowns   time
 1            2-3%
 2            12-13%
 3            10%-40%
 
 So, I think that this test is not very useful. 
 
 Just for kicks, I turned the autosaving delay on my mred to 300 seconds and
 ran four mred's in mzos. The cpu time was between two and three
 percent. So, it may be just a constant factor extra work with a lot of
 noise.
