>Description:
In the help desk page for "insert in pasteboard%", there
seems to be a confusion everywhere between "snip" and
"before", leading to explanations like:

Inserts snip at location (x, y) just in front of snip.
[...] If snip is #f, then snip is inserted behind all
other snips.

which I think should instead read as:

Inserts snip at location (x, y) just in front of before.
[...] If before is #f, then snip is inserted behind all
other snips.
