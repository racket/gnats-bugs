>Description:
I have a Windows 2000 and NetBSD partition on my laptop; the graphics programs on Windows blazingly fast but run terribly slow on NetBSD--perhaps 1/1000 th of the speed (and I'm not exagerating).
>How-To-Repeat:
Run any graphics program.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 11 17:04:22 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    The problem is get-pixel under X.
    
    I've implemented a try-small-region-first strategy
    for v205. The small region is 8x8, which provides
    a significant speedup for the fly program at 200x200.
    Still, using an array in parallel to the image runs much
    faster.
