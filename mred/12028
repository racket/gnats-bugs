>Description:
Two of my workshop participants ran into this yesterday, and I've replicated it on my own Mac.  Very simply, you copy an image (we've tried various formats) from a Web browser (we've tried it on Firefox, MSIE, and Safari), and paste it into either Definitions or Interactions in DrRacket.  You get a white space the right height and width, but with no visible pixels.  image-width and image-height work as expected.  rotate-cw gives you a new white space with the correct (rotated) height and width, but still no visible pixels.

"Insert Image" from the Insert menu works fine.

This MUST be fixed before the next release!

 FWIW, if you copy an image and then run this program, you also see the problem:
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200] [height 200]))
 (define t (new text%))
 (define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
 (send t paste)
 (send f show #t)

 Any progress on this one?  It's really pretty serious for those of us running workshops, demos, and introductory classes, and I would vote against releasing 5.1.2 until it's fixed.
