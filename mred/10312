>Description:
I'm wondering why is it that hitting the default keybinding
for backward-kill-word (m:del/esc:del) no longer works in 4.2. It
used to work before. I have only tested it so far for the Linux and
Windows ports (although on which platforms is this behavior being
observed may not be relevant at all)

Press m:del

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

This was a bug n the editor-classes port to Scheme.
The keymap string "del" was mapped to 'delete instead of #\rubout.
