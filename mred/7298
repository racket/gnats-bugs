 I'm not able to reproduce the bug so far. I'll try more machines, but
 in the meantime, can you get anything like a stack trace?
 
 Thanks,

 Sure -- how do I get a stack trace? I tried running DrScheme from the 
 command line but didn't get any error messages when it crashed.

 Under Windows, the only way I know is to run within Visual Studio. If
 you're using the pre-built binaries, that's probably not so easy.

 I'm afraid I don't have Visual Studio. Have you had any luck reproducing 
 yet? It's happening pretty consistently for me.

 Not yet. Do you select the "Open" menu item with the mouse, or by a
 particular keyboard shortcut?

 Anything: with the mouse from File | Open, with the drop-down from the 
 top-left of the screen (under the current filename), or with the Ctrl-O 
 keyboard shortcut.

 I one more machine, and still no luck.
 
 I think there must be a way to get a stack dump without installing
 MSVC. In the old days, you could enable DrWatson, but I don't see that
 anymore in XP. Do you have any Windows experts around?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I asked Joe, and when I showed him the behavior, we looked at the event 
 log and saw nothing. Since there's absolutely no error message, I think 
 this means that Windows doesn't view this as a crash -- it must think 
 it's correctly calling exit() (or whatever the Win32 API version is called).
 
 I'm going to install Visual Studio Express and see if I can build with 
 that. I've been wanting to try that out for a while, anyway. I'll send 
 you an update soon...

 Okay, I managed to build with Visual Studio Express and reproduce the 
 bug with a Debug build. But Joe and I couldn't decipher the error. If 
 you want to call me and step me through what to do, I'm in my office and 
 will be for another hour or two -- the number is 617-373-7893.
 
 Here's what I did:
 
 - built the MrEd project in Debug configuration
 - Debug | Start
 - File | Load File...
 - hover over a .ss file, then click cancel
 - File | Load File...
 - hover over a .ss file and it crashes
 
 Here's the stack trace:

 It's in the RtlAllocateHeap thread. Here's the end of the output:

 Thanks!
 
 This is pretty deep in Windows code (i.e., not MrEd).
 
 Just to make sure, does this happen with v209 DrScheme, or is it only
 v299?

 Wow! It happens in v209, too!
 
 Also, I've been playing with it and it only seems to happen to files on 
 my Desktop. Or at least, it's consistently the second time I open the 
 open dialog box and hover over a file on my Desktop, and I couldn't seem 
 to reproduce it with files in other directories. It doesn't seem to 
 matter what the contents or metadata of the file are, but it has to be a 
 .ss or .scm file.

 But not in other applications, presumably?
 
 Does it happen if you start just MrEd and evaluate `(get-file)'?

 Well, what do you know? I was able to reproduce it in Windows Notepad, 
 too... I guess it's a Windows bug after all. And I can reproduce it with 
 other files than *.ss or *.scm. Huh. Sorry for all the time spent on this.

 Well, it was a lot more of your time than mine. Also, re-inspecting
 some relevant code uncovered a potential 3m bug.
 
 I am, however, happy to have arrived at a resolution of sorts.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
