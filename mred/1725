>Description:
When trying to open a DrScheme file in windows, the program 
starts and then attempts to load the wrong file (it doesn't
allow for spaces in the file name and tries to load several
files, each with a piece of the name of the original file.
It can't find those files, so it fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
Name a scheme file with spaces (i.e., "My big project.scm")
Try to open it in windows (double-click from Explorer, go
through Recent Documents, etc.)
DrScheme will start and then attempt to load "My.scm, Big.scm,
and Project.scm", all separately.  
However, it all works if you open DrScheme first, and then
use the Open command in the File menu...
