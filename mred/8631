 I haven't been able to reproduce this problem. I do use OS X with the
 dock on the left, and maximize seems to work right for me. (It didn't
 before v360, I'm pretty sure.)
 
 Here's the program I ran in DrScheme's "MrEd" language:
 
  (define f (new frame% [label "Hi"]))
  (send f show #t)
  (send f maximize #t)
 
 Any idea why I might be seeing something different?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
