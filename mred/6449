drscheme is using old library for libpng - current is libpng.so.3
cannot launch due to failed library load

Any help would be appreciated, as I would like to use drscheme for my functional programming course. Thanks!

>How-To-Repeat:
Extracted .tar.gz to directory
Ran install script
Launched drscheme script from prompt as root

[kon@localhost bin]$ ./drscheme
/usr/local/plt/bin/mred: error while loading shared libraries: libpng.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

[kon@localhost bin]$ ./mred
./mred: error while loading shared libraries: libpng.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

 Are you using the source installation? If not, you might have to do
 that. I may be able to help if you get stuck.
