>Description:
Closing the application completely hangs the machine without even a kernel panic: the keyboard dies, and not a mere blink of the drives nor the network interfaces happens any more.

I haven't been able to try to ssh into the system from some other machine but it doesn't look like it'd work anyway... /var/log/messages says nothing after reboot. The system simply died.

Please ask for any data that might be of use, I'll be glad to help if I can.
>How-To-Repeat:
If necessary, I can provide compiler version, etc. and more detailed data on the build and installation process as well as any logs available, but the *same error happened with the binary i386 distribution* so most of that might not be of much help.

- Compile from plt-352-src-unix.tgz on a x86_64 machine running
  SuSE's 2.6.13-15.12-default kernel.
- Install in a single directory.
- Run.
- Choose "File->quit" (or whatever the path is. I don't remember
  exactly, and I'd rather not try a third time right now ;)
- Accept the confirmation dialog.
- Die.
- Thank Mr. Reiser & reiserfs developers for such an stable FS. xD

 This may be due to a faulty GL driver.  Try to recompile without GL
 support.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Mon, 16 Oct 2006 23:20:07 -0400
Reason>>> sounds like a bad GL driver, but no reply yet


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:40 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
