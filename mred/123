>Description:
1) If you click in the edit above the end of the output, text is inserted
at that point, rather than the end

>How-To-Repeat:
1)	startup mred with MREDDEBUG set to 'no-takeover on nt
	evaluate (printf "1~n1~n1~n1~n1~n")
	click in the stdout window, somewhere above the end
	evaluate (printf "2~n2~n2~n2~n2~n")
	the 2's will be in the middle of the 1's.
>Fix:
1)	instead of (insert <text>) do (insert <text> (last-position))
