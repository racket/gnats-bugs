>Description:

when drscheme is not frontmost and there are windows in the on top of it
(not completely covering drscheme, just partially) as it starts up,
portions of the drscheme window are just white and do not redraw. Typically 
this is a portion of the top-right corner (including half of a button) and
a portion of the bottom-left corner (including (sometimes) half of the
line-number edit)

>How-To-Repeat:

startup drscheme
wait for it to say "invoking"
put it behind some windows
wait for the drscheme window to show up
move it back to the front and it won't redraw

>Fix:

After a year of seraching, I finally fixed it. MacOS, apparently in
some quest to be the crappiest OS on the planet, drops update events
if you ask for only autoKey events.
