>Description:
The MRed-process seems to have a memory-leak (the amount of used memory always grows)
This happens when Dr-Scheme is open, but is not doing anything (so no running
Scheme-processes)
>How-To-Repeat:
Just open Dr-Scheme and lt it run for a while. Check the used memory in 
the control panel.

 PLT Scheme uses a conservative garbage collector, which means that some
 memory cannot be reclaimed.  So I think the behavior you see is not a
 bug, just a consequence of this GC approach.
 
 We're working on an exact collector, which should obviate the kind of
 problem you see.  The exact collector should appear in a future version
 of PLT Scheme.

 Robby Findler says this may be a Real Bug.  So I'm re-opening the PR.

State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed some leaks after 200alpha12, and before 200.
    No doubt there are still problems, especially in Mac OS,
    but that falls under the general-maintenance category.
