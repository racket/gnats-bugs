>Description:
This one's a little more subtle. I would have expected the two keymaps to behave identically (preferably the way the direct one behaves) when typing control-x, control-k, a. Instead, I get a "1" in one and I get "2a" in the other.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (one k)
  (send k add-function "one" (λ (x y) (send x insert "1")))
  (send k map-function "c:x;c:g;a" "one"))
(define (two k)
  (send k add-function "two" (λ (x y) (send x insert "2")))
  (send k map-function "c:g" "two"))
  

(define k1 (new keymap%))
(one k1)

(define k2 (new keymap%))
(two k2)

(define chained-keymap (new keymap%))
(send chained-keymap chain-to-keymap k1 #f)
(send chained-keymap chain-to-keymap k2 #f)

(define direct-keymap (new keymap%))
(one direct-keymap)
(two direct-keymap)

(define (f k)
  (define t (new text%))
  (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200] [height 70]))
  (define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
  (send t set-keymap k)
  (send ec focus)
  (send f show #t))

(f chained-keymap)
(f direct-keymap)

 FWIW, I think (hope!) I have correctly added the keybindings
 
   control-x, control-k, a
   control-x, control-k, b
   control-x, control-k, c
   control-x, control-k, d
   ...
 
 (both upper and lowercase) to drscheme to insert the greek letters.
 That's where these PRs are coming from (that code is checked in).

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 02 Aug 2007 12:58:56 -0400
Reason>>> fixed in SVN --- by changing the chaining implementation
to something more understandable. I worry about the size of
the change considering the target release date, but the old code
seems so confused that it's probably best to change it anyway

 PS: thanks! I'm very glad to have the greek letters typeable now.

 As for the worry -- there are three chained keymaps: seaching,
 file-related, and general. I tried one key each and they seem to work.
 Of course, that probably doesn't explore all of the chaining-related
 issues.
 
 If one wanted to be diligent, one could try lots of the keybindings in
 the keybindings dialog (its content isn't changed by the change).
 
 Or maybe building a test suite would be easier. I'd be surprised if
 there was some bad behavior of the old one that you would want to
 preserve, but you could run the test suite in the old and the new and
 compare the results to see what actually did change.
