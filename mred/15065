>Description:
While developing and playing a patience solitaire game (Flower
Garden) I have had two experiences which might or might not be
consequences of race conditions in the Virtual Card Library or
perhaps even in the editor-pasteboard-snip classes which are the
foundation for Virtual Card Library. Perhaps it has to do with the
practice of using something like "(inner (void) method-name ...)"
in the handlers of the pasteboard class in classes.rkt but I'm not
sure about this.
 Right now I don't understand enough about the
inner workings of "inner" and the editor classes so I can't really
help you. For me these bugs are unreproducible but it might be
useful to change the time interval's of the animations in
"classes.rkt".

Issue #1: in a new game after program start the second
card in a flower bed which was face down could be moved. As
reconfigure-cards in the flower-bed class is rather clear about
this issue and because it happened during the animation of an
unrelated move and is part of the Virtual Card Library's special
behaviours.

Issue #2: during an animation an accidental double
click (without the final button up) onto the table background
started a selection with a rectangle whose border was the inverse
color of the current table background. The z-axis order of the
cards and perhaps other things were screwed up afterwards.
>How-To-Repeat:
With the default behavior of the Virtual Card Library it's almost
impossible to reproduce. One could try to slow down the
animations considerably.

 The problem turns out not to be a race condition, but inappropriate
 chaining to the pasteboard's default mouse-event handling.
 
 For issue 1, starting a mouse drag (by clicking on the background)
 during an animation, and then dragging the mouse over a card can cause
 the drag to be treated like a click on the card --- even if the card
 does not normally support clicks. (This behavior is easier to replicate
 using Go Fish, which starts with a lot of animation.)
 
 For issue 2, I wasn't able to provoke the problem with a double-click,
 but clicking on the background, dragging outside the window, and then
 moving back into the window reliably starts a background selection that
 is not intended to be allowed.

 Perhaps it's better to not interpret button-down events as clicks but to go
 back to the era of signal processing and tested broken mice to combine
 one button-down and one button-up event  into one click event?

 Ah, I see. Interesting: it  does not use the reverse color of the background
 but it's always orange for me (which is my user defined Mac selection color).
 
 But the selection routine reverses the z-axis order of the cards within the
 bounding box. Selecting the same cards again restores the original layout.
 Interesting behavior! It might become the first card based desktop. ;-)
