>Description:
Often, when I click on a menu in drScheme, clicks don't register 
on any of the menu items that come up (I click, but nothing happens -- 
the item doesn't highlight, etc).  Furthermore, the unresponsive
menus become sticky in my virtual window manager (until I click on
another menu header, which starts the problem over again).  

I was having this problem with 201, and appear to still have it in 203. 
I'm using CDE as my window manager.  
>How-To-Repeat:
About half of the menu accesses on my machine cause this problem.  
It doesn't appear to be load-related.  Can't give more precise diagnosis.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Sun, 04 Apr 2004 00:37:51 -0500
Reason>>> mred
State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Fri, 28 Jan 2005 12:19:20 -0500
Reason>>> I think this is likely fixed in v299, because I changed the
way that menu locations are tracked. Can you check, Kathy?

Thanks,
Matthew

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 27 Nov 2006 09:14:32 -0500
