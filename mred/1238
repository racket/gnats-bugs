I'm running a v101 that Pablo bundled for me this afternoon.

The initial directory you get when you run 
Language | Set Teachpack To ...
is a function of your prior actions.  I had earlier loaded the
PLT icon into the Definitions window using Edit | Insert Image ...
and the directory I was put in when I tried to set the Teachpack
was the icons directory.

NOTE: I haven't run Setup PLT for this distribution.

>How-To-Repeat:
Use Edit | Insert Image ... to get something from
plt/collects/icons/.
Choose Language | Set Teachpack To ... .
I end up in the icons directory.

 I cannot reproduce this. I followed the steps you listed, but I get the
 right directory.

 After a little more poking around, this appears to be a problem with the
 binary. The function `get-file' doesn't always use its last argument as
 the initial directory. For example:
 
   (get-file "message" #f "d:/plt")
 
 is not guaranteed to open the directory in "d:/plt" (but it does
 sometimes...). According to the manual, get-file does this:
 
 ; -- begin manual exerpt --
 
 If directory is not #f, it is used as the starting directory for the
 file selector (otherwise the starting directory is chosen automatically
 in a platform-specific manner, usually based on the current directory
 and the user's interactions in previous calls to get-file and put-file).
 If filename is not #f, it is used as the default filename when
 appropriate. If extension is not #f, the return path will use the
 extension if the user does not supply one (Windows).
 
 ; -- end manual exerpt --
 
 In fact, after tring things out, I cannot even figure out what "platform
 specific manner" is being used. So, until we know that, no progress can
 be made.
 
 Matthew, I will move this pr to be yours.

State-Changed-Why:

`get-file' was (indirectly) ignoring the directory path if it did not
match Windows conventions: backslashes instead of regular slashes, no
extra slashes, etc. The bug was in the glue, which mis-identified the
argument as a string instead of a pathname.

Fixed for the next release.
