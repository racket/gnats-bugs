 I am unable to reproduce this problem. You are clicking on "The Type
 language" in the table of contents? Does it happen every time?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Yes, and yes.  We can try it when I come in, if you wish.

 An addendum: this doesn't happen when you first start up the MrSpidey
 documentation.  However, if you visit the Type Language page, then
 visit several other pages (I've found the ones _below_ that page
 help), then try to visit it again, you get the error.  Matthew's
 conjecture is that the problem is with the caching mechanism.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem had two parts:
 1) When a wx:image-snip% was cached by the HTML system, the
    originally created snip was kep in the cache. This snip would
    be inserted into a buffer that was subsequently GC'ed,
    invalidating the snip in the process. The solution is to
    keep a copy of the snip in the cache.

 2) For the most part, the cache didn't work anyway. (I had
    suspected this for a while, since loading text pages with
    just the navigation arrows was so slow.) The cache managed
    to work (sortof) in this case for obscure reasons.

Fixed and released.
