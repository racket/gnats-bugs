Thought I'd send you a bug report.

DrScheme exhibits behavior I've never seen out of any other Windows program before. If you click on it's menubar and hold the mouse down and move the window around it will wipe out the 2 buttons on the window as well as all the other text in the window. Releasing the button will redraw it. I've always set window to show window contents when moving windows around.

In other Windows programs it will move the window around without losing data on the screen.

A cosmetic bug, but a jarring one to see.

State-Changed-Why:
    Report is true for me (substitute "title bar" for "menu
    bar" --- that confused me for a long time!), but given
    the complexity of event handling, it probably won't change.
