>Description:
In the REPL, Meta-P is painfully slow on large expressions.

In contrast, copying expressions down, by hitting return at the end 
of an old expression, is fast.

>How-To-Repeat:
Enter a very large expression in the DrScheme/MrEd REPL (> 20 lines).
Execute it.
Hit Meta-P.
Try again.

(Sometimes, Meta-P seemed to go fast; I'm not sure whether that was
a problem with my testing technique, or whether the bug is intermittent.
But it has definitely been slow often enough to be a consistent problem
for me.)

State-Changed-Why:

The problem is related to parenthesis-hiliting. When I turn
parenthesis hiliting off, Meta-P and Meta-N work at a reasonable speed
for a large S-expression. When I turn it on, they're quite slow.
