>Description:
I am running Microsoft Windows XP, Tablet PC Edition 2005,
version 2002, Service Pack 2 on a Toshiba Portege 3500
with a 1.33 GHz Mobile Pentium III.

Whenever I run v208 or v209 of Dr. Scheme, upon exiting 
Dr. Scheme I am no longer able to Shutdown or Restart 
Windows on my tablet (I have to unplug it and remove the 
battery). Additionally, unless I do the "manual reboot" 
I cannot restart Dr. Scheme. If I select Dr. Scheme to
run, the program does not start up a second time.

I tried using version 205. On this version, I still am
unable to shutdown Windows after running Dr. Scheme, but I
am able to restart Dr. Scheme multiple times without a
"manual reboot".

Note that this bug started appearing after I installed
Service Pack 2. It did not occur prior to that 
installation. I have students who have NOT experienced
this problem on a regular PC with Service Pack 2.

Just run v205, v208 or v209 of Dr. Scheme on my Tablet PC.

 Thanks for the report.
 
 On question for now: Can you avoid the "manual shutdown" by using the
 task manager (ctl-alt-delete) to end the "DrScheme.exe" process?

 JFYI, this is probably because older versions of DrScheme didn't check
 for an existing DrScheme instance when starting up.
