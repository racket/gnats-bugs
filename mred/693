>Description:

When getting the label of a menu item, the keybinding portion of the string
is omitted. Admittedly, the docs don't really say that the code below
should return #t, but the only sane thing seems for it to do so.

>How-To-Repeat:

this returns #f. I expect #t

(define label (string-append "menu item" (string #\tab) "c:x"))
(define mbar (make-object wx:menu-bar%))
(define menu (make-object wx:menu%))
(send menu append 1151 label null #f)
(send mbar append menu "menu")
(string=? label (send menu get-label 1151))
