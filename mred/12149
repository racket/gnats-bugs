>Environment:
unix-other
>Description:
The list-box%, when using column-headers, does not have a horizontal scroll on Linux/Unix. On Windows, the horizontal scroll works properly. I marked this as serious, because there is no way to see the right most columns when there are many.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define f (new frame% [label "Test"]))

(define l (new list-box%
               [label #f]
               [choices '("1" "2" "3")]
               [parent f]
               [style '(multiple column-headers)]
               [columns '("A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G")]))

(send f show #t)
