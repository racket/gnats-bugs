>Description:
the return key selects a file in the rhs list-box%
in the std file dialog, but has no effect in the lhs
list-box%, and it could open the directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.
  (get-file (collection-path "mzlib"))

2.
  click in (or tab to) lhs list box, which contains the directories
  in this case, ".." and "CVS". typing return has no effect.
