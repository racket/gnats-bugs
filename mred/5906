>Description:
A short fat grey line is erroneously temporarily displayed during
preference panel display updating, which may be innocuous, or
indicative of something something more significant: (see how to
repeat)
>How-To-Repeat:
- restart DrScheme, as it only occurs once per session.
- open the preference window, if not already selected, select the top-
level panel to "Editing" and it's second level panel selection to "Font",
and then quit and restart, causing these settings to be used as default
next time; otherwise proceed:
- select the top-level panel "Browser"
- reselect the top-level panel "Editing",
  - then it's second level panel "Indenting", causing a short grey fat
line to be improperly displayed underneath the "Editing" panel
selection tab, which will eventually disappear and not return again
until the above sequence is repeated.

(like I said, likely not a big deal, but it may be indicative of some other
subtle problem with memory initialization, garbage-collection, or
whatever; which may also be introducing other subtle worse problems
elsewhere?)

 Thanks for the detailed report!
 
 This is a problem with the way MrEd uses the tab control. Roughly, MrEd
 doesn't give the control enough room to draw itself.
 
 I'm hoping to fix this when I attach a floating panel to the tab
 control to hold the panel's content.
