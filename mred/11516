>Description:
The following installation http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/full-5.0.99.4-bin-i386-win32.exe

Does not work on Windows Vista x64, due to Get/SetWindowLongPtrW not found. These are actually called Set/GetWindowLongW in the user32.dll

----

My obvious solution was to find in all *.rkt files Set/GetWindowLongPtrW and replace it with Set/GetWindowLongW
>How-To-Repeat:
Please install http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/full-5.0.99.4-bin-i386-win32.exe on Windows Vista.

Start DrScheme.

A text report would follow that GetWindowLongPtrW cannot be found.

 Thanks very much for the report! As you may have seen in my blog reply,
 this is fixed in our current sources, and a new build should become
 available soon.
