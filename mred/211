>Description:
If I open a URL in the DrScheme HTML browser, it blocks all frames while it's opening the page.  It cannot be stopped.

[I realize we're not writing another netscape, but a little recoverability would be nice]

Clarification (from Matthew):
It isn't network operations. It's just that the Browser doesn't spawn
threads for communication.
>How-To-Repeat:
open a url.

It's breakable in Help Desk, but we should make sure DrScheme starts
Help Desk in its own eventspace.

Reason>>> Fixed ages ago.
