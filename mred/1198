>Description:
Although editor-snip%s are availble to extend,
their extensions cannot be fully utilized without
reimplemnting everything in it's snipclass, since
the snipclass% is not available.
>How-To-Repeat:
There are some funny things in the printing of classes, too:
      
> (make-object object%)
#<object:object%>
> (make-object (class object% () (public [x 1]) (sequence (super-init))))
#<object>
> (class object% () (public [x 1]) (sequence (super-init)))
#<class>

According to the above printing, I would expect this:

> (send (make-object editor-snip% (make-object text%)) get-snipclass)
#<object:snip-class%>

to print like #<object:snip-class%>. I don't know which is wrong.

 This is true. I don't plan to add it for now, though, because the class
 does so little.

 Do you mean that you expect
   #<object>
 ? Makes sense. It may be especially hard to fix, but I'll look into it.

 I hope that I did not mark this one as a high priority. I have since
 found `read-from-file' and `write-to-file' methods of editor<%>. These
 solve the problem for me. Probably only docs are needed.
