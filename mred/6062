 Is this easily reproducible?  Viz:
 
 1) open new DrScheme window.
 2) hit Control-Space
 3) click execute
 4) => error

 There actually appears to be a broader problem with the
 use of copied/pasted of text in general:
 
 The canonical form for copied line termination on a Mac in
 general is an ascii return (0D) character, however within
 DrScheme the following characters are used and copied to
 the past-board as line terminators:
 
 - from within a DrScheme text frame: new-line(0A)
 - from within a DrS HelpDesk window: new-line(0A) + N non-ascii(A0)'s
 
 Causing the following problems:
 
 - can't copy/paste DrScheme text into other app windows, like mail, etc.
 - can't copy/paste internal HelpDesk text into DrScheme windows, because
   (A0)'s generates an "reference to undefined identifier:" error message.
 
 I believe the general solution is to:
 - copy converts internal new-line(0A) to return(0D) ascii characters.
 - paste converts return(0D) to internal new-line(0A) ascii characters.
 - eliminate the use of non-ascii(A0) in the HelpDesk text.
 - and non-ascii markers used for bug icons, etc., could be converted to
   rough textual equivalents like #|bug|# or whatever, or simply deleted.
 
 Thanks again, -paul-

 Also noticed that the bug-list message logger seems to eliminate
 blank lines from my original email below; don't know if it is
 intentional, or simply possibly dropping the lines with only a
 line terminator in them in error?

 Well that's weird, if I display this thread on a Mac from within
 MS Internet Explorer, I don't see blank lines, however if viewed
 within Apple's Safari, then I do see the original blank lines?
 
 (but if I view source from within IE, then I see the blank lines again,
  wonder what line-terminator character IE wants to display correctly?)
 
 Sorry for the noise regarding missing blank lines noticed on my reports,
 but now sense it's a Mac IE display problem, thanks for your patience,

Reason>>> mred problem (I changed the synopsis text)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 16 Nov 2006 22:01:11 -0500
Reason>>> I think this problem went away with the introduction of Unicode
support, because U+A0 became whitespace for the MzScheme
reader.
