 Here's what it says on the DrScheme download page for Linux:
 
 
        WARNING: The Linux binary was compiled with a stock 
        RedHat 6.1 distribution. With other varieties of Linux 
        (Debian, or other versions of Red Hat, for example), you 
        may have difficulties due to library incompatibilities. 
        If you experience crashes, try downloading and compiling 
        source code instead. Source code is available through the 
        DrScheme download page. 
 
 Try downloading the "Unix/X" sources from 
 
     http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/
 
 and recompile MrEd and MzScheme.  You may need to change some 
 variables in the Makefile, as indicated in the compilation 
 directions.
