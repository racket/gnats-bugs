>Description:
When I've been working at a scheme program over some time, there comes a point where the shortcut keys control-x and control-c have no effect (however control-insert and control-shift-delete still work). This seems to persist even after I've saved the file, closed DrScheme, and reloaded the file. The only way I know of to fix this is to copy and paste the old file into a new one, however the problem reasserts itself after a while.

 I am informed by Alan Zaring <akzaring@cc.owu.edu> that he too has
 observed this problem.  I expect that if you wanted more information,
 he would be happy to provide it.  He notes:
 
 > I find that when cut/copy stop working, if I insert one or more characters 
 > into the definitions pane, cut/copy start working again.
