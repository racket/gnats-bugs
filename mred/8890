>Description:
The example at the end of the intro to chapter 8 (right before section 8.1) does not work in MrEd.  Specifically, it complains about the line:
(override can-insert? can-delete?)
which is valid, since these methods should only be augmented.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to use the example in the documentation:

(define append-only-text% 
  (class text%
    (inherit last-position) 
    (override can-insert? can-delete?)
    (define (can-insert? s l) (= s (last-position)))
    (define (can-delete? s l) #f)
    (super-instantiate ())))
>Fix:

Reason>>> fixed, finally
