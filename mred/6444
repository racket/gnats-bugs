>Description:
While running DrScheme from PLT Scheme v205 
on Mac OSX version 10.2.6 I saw the button bar 
disappear when the window is minimized and then
restored.  

The button bar can be made to reappear by repeating
the process - that is - minimize the window and 
then restore again. 

By "button bar" - I mean the section of a DrScheme 
window that contains the Save, Step, Execute, and
Break buttons. 


I haven't tried this on other Mac OS X versions.
Furthemore, I don't recall seeing this problem in
PLT Scheme v203, although I didn't try to reproduce
the problem in v203.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.) Install PLT Scheme v205 on a machine running
OS X in the usual manner.

2.) Bring up DrScheme by clicking on the appropriate icon.
(I launch DrScheme by clicking on an icon that I've
placed in the dock, but I doubt that this matters).

3.) Note that your button bar is present.  

4.) Now minimize the window by clicking on the 
minimize button (the decoration with the '-' (minus)
sign on it in the upper left corner).  

5.) Maximize the window that you just minimized by 
clicking on it in the dock.  

6.) Note that the button bar is now gone.  This is the
bug/issues/strangeness. 

7.) Now minimize the window again, and then restore
again.  Note that the button bar has reappeared. 

I could make the button bar disappear and reappear
any number of times but minimizing and restoring.  

Note - I've only tried this on one Macintosh.  
I have no evidence that it does (or doesn't)
occur on other machines.  The Mac where I 
saw this problem is a G4 Cube running OS X 10.2.6
(Jaguar).

Also note that I saw this bug on a computer that is
NOT the one where I'm typing this report.  I'm mentioning
this because I noticed that these bug reports contain
information about my current DrScheme environment.

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep 10 13:44:35 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed for the next version.
    
    The problem was simpler than I expected. The handler for
    a minimize click mistakenly also called the handler for a
    toolbar click.
    
    The window-content-doesn't-resize-on-maximize
    bug has been fixed, too.
