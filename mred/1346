>Description:
I apologize if there is some history here that I am not aware of, but
as far as I am concerned, the pen size 1 in a postscript-dc is much
too wide. Currently, the zero size pen draws extremely thin
lines, which is fine because someone might want such thin things. But, the
pen size 1 draws lines that are far too thick. There should be more
gradations between the current 0 and 1 pen size.

In particular, I believe that the pen size 1 should be about as
thick as the lines in latex's existential quantifier, and
implication sign, and times romans equal sign and hyphen which
all appear to be about the same size in a printout I am looking
at. (I believe this 10pt times roman).

Without a pen this size, it is
impossible to mix mred-drawn special symbols with regular text,
because the lines come out far too thick.

 A pen size of 1 needs to match 1 logical unit in the dc. Drawing a
 lines of width 1 should be the same as drawing the frame of a rectangle
 that's 1 unit wide, etc.
 
 I'll look into make pen widths rational numbers, instead of integers.

 Well.... I guess I would say that all of those are too thick in
 postscript then. Perhaps I am missing something? Relatively speaking,
 they are much thicker than they seem to appear in a canvas-dc%, I think.

 Of course, this is also great for me.
