>Description:
When you get a popup such as mail delivery failure problems on filing
a bug report, you can only copy the entire text box message, not a part
of it.  The message, however, has a lot of prose with a URL embedded in
the middle, and all you care about is the URL.  You ought to be able
to copy just the URL!
>How-To-Repeat:
Disconnect email.
Try to submit bug report.
You'll get a popup listing bugs.plt-scheme.org.
Try to copy and paste just the URL.
