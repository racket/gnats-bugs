>Description:

It would be nice to get a command-line argument prompt for mred when
it is started up with the option-key held down.
	
This is mostly useful for developers. Today, I wanted to turn on the flag
to see what files were being loaded to debug mred's startup, but I couldn't 
do it without downloading another copy of mred. If I could have used the
command line, I wouldn't have had to download another copy.

MrEd 100/1 provides a dialog when the cmd key is held down. (Cmd is
the only key you can hold down to double-click and start an app
without the click having any other effect).
