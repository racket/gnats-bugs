>Description:
The attached code, when run in DrRacket, should produce a drawing that looks like an X.  In DrRacket version 5.1, instead it produces just a diagonal line.  This is because the draw-bitmap operation on the bitmap-dc is acting as though the drawing mode were 'opaque, even thought it is specified as 'solid.  This bug manifests in both the released 5.1 and the overnight 5.1.0.5--2011-04-04(b35b7d9/a), but not in 5.0.2.  I only have tested under MacOS (Intel).
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following code in DrRacket.  If you get a diagonal line, that's a bug.  If you get an X, that's good.

(let* ((bm1 (make-object bitmap% 100 100 #t))
       (bm2 (make-object bitmap% 100 100 #t))
       (dc1 (new bitmap-dc% (bitmap bm1)))
       (dc2 (new bitmap-dc% (bitmap bm2))))
  (send dc1 clear)
  (send dc1 draw-line 0 0 100 100)
  (send dc1 set-bitmap #f)
  (send dc2 clear)
  (send dc2 draw-line 0 100 100 0)
  (send dc2 draw-bitmap bm1 0 0 'solid)
  (send dc2 set-bitmap #f)
  (make-object image-snip% bm2))
