>Description:
I've finally managed to reproduce a problem that bugged me for a while.
It looks like in the help desk, after the mouse wheel is used, the mouse
cursor stops changing.  (This is a little annoying because I like big
cursors, and the text cursor is hard to use when you want to click on a
link).

I reproduced this on VNC and on the XonX thing too.

>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start help desk on X.
2. Move the mouse around and make sure it changes over links.
3. Keeping the mouse in the main window, use the mouse wheel once, it dosn't
   matter if it actually scrolls anything.
4. Move the mouse over links and text -- it does not change.
5. If you now click somewhere (link or text), or move the mouse outside the
   window and back in, it will respond as usual again.
