>Description:
I've upgraded the operating system on my G3 towers to 9.1 and tried to load the latest version of DrScheme.  The plt.ppc-mac.sit file unstuffs just fine into the plt folder.  When I launch the Setup PLT application I get the following: "Setup PLT" could not be opened because ">>CarbonLib<<" could not start up."  CarbobLib is in the extensions folder, and I did move the netglue file from the plt folder to extensions, but that didn't help. Do I have a problem with my OS or is there something quirky about running DrScheme with Mac OS 9.1?  Any help would be appreciated.
Tom

 I have received no response to this bug report,  The on-line status still
 shows it open.  Is the problem still being worked?

 John Clements responded to another user with the same problem:

  This is a known bug, and we're working on fixing it.
  
  Please try the following workaround for your OS 9 DrScheme 
  installation problems, and please let us know whether this works:
  
  In the "plt" folder window, scroll down to MrEd, and start it up by 
  double-clicking.  After it starts up, quit it and _then_ double-click 
  on the Setup PLT application.
  
  Again, please let us know if this workaround resolves the problem.
