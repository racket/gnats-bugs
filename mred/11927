>Description:
The number of bytes get-argb-pixels sets appears to depend wrongly on the message parameter x. See steps to reproduce.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program:

#lang racket

(require racket/gui)

(define (get-column-alpha bm x)
  (define h (send bm get-height))
  (define bs (make-bytes (* 4 h)))
  (send bm get-argb-pixels x 0 1 h bs #t)
  (build-vector h (Î» (y) (bytes-ref bs (* 4 y)))))

(define bm (make-object bitmap% 10 10 #f #t))
(get-column-alpha bm 0)
(get-column-alpha bm 1)


The first call to get-column-alpha succeeds, but the second raises this error:

    bytes-set!: index 40 out of range [0, 39] for byte-string: ...

Changing the definition of bs in get-column-alpha to

    (define bs (make-bytes (* 4 (+ h 1))))

causes the second call to get-column-alpha to succeed, but then

    (get-column-alpha bm 2)

raises a similar error:

    bytes-set!: index 44 out of range [0, 43] for byte-string: ...

This definition of bs seems to work in general:

    (define bs (make-bytes (* 4 (+ h x))))

which is wrong, but is a temporary workaround.
