>Description:
The mred: toolbox is not threadsafe. Access to global state
should always be protected with semaphores.

[This is not really one bug. It's probably hundreds, and its hard
to pin them down or make them reproduceable. But we need to keep
this problem in mind.]

>How-To-Repeat:
Here's how I noticed this problem, though it probably will
be hard to reproduce the bug.

Run the tests/mred/mem.ss test suite, first changing the
argument to `make-semaphore' in line 49 to 100 instead of 1.
The error produced is:

  procedure application: expected procedure, given: #<undefined> 
 (no arguments)

The semaphore defined in line 49 of mem.ss protects the creation of a
new mred:editor-frame% (so only one is created at a time). Apparently,
something in the creation of a mred:editor-frame% is not thread-safe.
Using errortrace, it appears that the problem has something to do with
preferences, which makes sense since that is global state.
