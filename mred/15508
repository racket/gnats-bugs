>Description:
When using DrRacket in Windows 10 (I haven't tried this in other Windows versions), a DrRacket Internal Error occurs after locking Windows (Windows key + L) or letting Windows 10 go to sleep. It shows up after "waking" up Windows. There is a dialog titled "DrRacket Internal Error" with the message "GetCursorPos: call failed (5)" and an OK button. This dialog is on top of a CMD window with the title "Select DrRacket" and the same message of "GetCursorPos: call failed (5)". The CMD window is not closable (the Windows "X" is grayed out) until DrRacket is closed. The number 5 is the number I have seen every time in parantheses.

This is happening consistently. I haven't seen this on previous versions, however I can't tell you exactly what version it happened in because I am coming back to Racket after a few months.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open DrRacket
2) Wait until it fully loads
3) Lock Windows (Windows key + L) or put it to sleep.
4) Log back on to Windows, and you will see the above described dialog and command window.

 Here is a very recent and related commit:
 https://github.com/racket/gui/commit/e46e23d96e987efec22fead36bee552b5975a3b4
 
 It doesn't appear to have fixed this issue and maybe made it worse? I have
 never seen this bug in all my use of Racket on Windows 10 before now, and I
 took a break from using Racket on my Windows 10 machine starting before
 this commit and ending after. I do not recall when I upgraded to Racket
 6.11.

 Just to be clear: That commit isn't included in v6.11. Does the issue
 remain for you in a pre-release build?
 
 Thanks!
 Matthew
