>Description:
The width of a message% is the pixel-width of its
initial value, not its string-length, as easily assumed.
This is mentioned for the get-width method, but not for the
set-label method.

(Note: It would be nice if you could define the font, e.g.,
to a fixed-width font, during message% object creation.
Instead you have to change the parent's font, inherit the
font from the parent, and (if desired) change the parent's
font back to avoid other unwanted inheritances.)
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "message-test"))

(define msg1 (make-object message% "            " frame))
(define msg2 (make-object message% "123456789012" frame))

(send frame show #t)

(send msg1 set-label "hello, world")
(send msg2 set-label "HELLO, WORLD")

(send frame show #t)
