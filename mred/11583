When editting a file in split view (View->Split) the secondary view jumps around when copying and pasting in the primary view. This severly limits the usefullness of the split view for code reorganization.

 This happens just at the racket/gui layer with just text% objects. Run
 the program below, scroll the bottom window to the end of the file,
 click and then click the "insert abc" button and the upper window will
 scroll. Also the paste button does the same thing, included just in
 case there is something else special about paste the also scrolls even
 if insert didn't.
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 400] [height 600]))
 (define t (new text%))
 (send t load-file (collection-file-path "rep.rkt" "drracket" "private"))
 (send t set-filename #f)
 (define ec1 (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
 (define ec2 (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
 (define bp (new horizontal-panel% [parent f] [stretchable-height #f]))
 (void (new button% [parent bp] [callback (=CE=BB x (send t copy))] [label "=
 copy"]))
 (void (new button% [parent bp] [callback (=CE=BB x (send t paste))] [label =
 "paste"]))
 (void (new button% [parent bp] [callback (=CE=BB x (send t insert "abc"))]
 [label "insert abc"]))
 (send f show #t)
