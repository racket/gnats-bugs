 I finally understand. The summary misled me, because there was a time
 when clicking "+" would simply grow the window a little instead of
 maximizing. In other words, clicking once would grow the window a
 little, clicking a second time would grow the window a little more, and
 so on.
 
 I think you mean that clicking "+" *twice* makes the window maximize
 and then return to a slightly larger height. Clicking *twice* again
 makes it grow a little more, and so on. Is that right?
 
 This effect is not subtle, but it's still much more subtle than the one
 I was looking for, which is why I kept failing to see it.
 
 Now that I see, this bug may actually be fixed. MrEd somehow confuses
 Carbon so that it sometimes mixes up the content region with the
 structure region. I haven't been able to find the root of this
 confusion, but I know how to work around it.

 - just updated, and rebuilding to verify as I write this.
