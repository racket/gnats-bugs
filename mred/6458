>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
Run the program below 50 times. Probably, on one of
them, the show method won't return, apparently
due to a deadlock. According to the manual, I cannot
see any reason that this code should deadlock, unless
there is a bug in one of the libraries it uses.

(module tmp mzscheme
  (require (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
           (lib "class.ss")
           (lib "async-channel.ss"))
  
  (define evt-chan (make-async-channel))
  (define c%
    (class canvas%
      (inherit get-dc)
      (define/override (on-paint) (async-channel-put evt-chan 1))
      (super-new)))
  
  (define frame (new frame% (label "CML GUI")))
  (define canvas (new c%
                      (parent frame)
                      (stretchable-width #f)
                      (stretchable-height #f)
                      (min-width 200)
                      (min-height 200)))
  
  (thread
   (lambda ()
     (let loop ()
       (object-wait-multiple
        #f
        (make-wrapped-waitable 
         evt-chan
         (lambda (evt)
           (loop)))))))

 I have a good idea where this bug originates (fancy window update
 mechanism for OS X), and I hope to look at it soon.

 Cool, thanks! I wasn't sure if it got lost in you inbox, so I thought
 I'd put it where it belongs :)
