>Description:
On a dual P2, 128Meg machine with Matrox AGP Graphicx, MrScheme 5.1 
hangs, usually when I try to save a file using the platform specific 
file dialogs.

Turning off the NT File dialogs defers the hang, but does not eliminate it.

When DrS hangs, an attempt to kill it with TaskManager will hang TaskManager as well.  

This machine is a MS Proxy 2.0 client as well.

 This bug in DrScheme 51 has been fixed. DrScheme 52 will be available
 soon, probably within a few days.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
