>Description:
small add'l request: please index "Standard"
to point to the description of the "Standard" style
in the mred manual.

I would like to set some parameter of an editor<%>
so that when snips are inserted they do not get
the "Standard" style of the style list, but some
other named style that I can specify. 

For now, I am
just going to use the on-insert method to force
all styles to my new style, but it would be nice
if I didn't have to do that. 

This is for the XML boxes, so their font sizes change
properly.
