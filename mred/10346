>Description:
When searching for the next match in DrScheme, if the match is off-screen, then the editor window (or REPL, whatever) is scrolled such that the line is visible. However, if the line is on the edge of the screen, the editor is not scrolled, leaving only part of the line visible. The entire line should be visible (if possible.)

Note that it might not be possible, if the line is long or contains an image snip higher than the window height, for example.

 Judging from the docs, I think the Scheme-level code is doing the
 right thing (in frame.ss, the last occurrence of scroll-to-position is
 the right call I believe).
