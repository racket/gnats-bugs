>Description:
This is the first of two bug reports.

Check syntax has a problem with nonexistent requires; mzscheme
gives an error message, and check syntax shows it in the check
syntax error box with the "hide" button, but the upper buffer
is still read-only, and I can't edit it.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module foo mzscheme
  (require "nonexistent-file.ss")

)

... click check-syntax

 I cannot reproduce this one, either.
 
 Please verify you have revision 1.42 of plt/collects/drscheme/syncheck.ss.
 
 Also, please use help desk to submit bug reports. The daily version
 numbers are important.

 I do have version 1.42 of plt/collects/drscheme/syncheck.ss.  I did 
 submit using Help Desk. I'm guessing that you want me to use Help 
 Desk inside of DrScheme, which I can't do because of a MrEd Mac bug. 
 I updated and ran setup-plt.  I can still duplicate both problems 
 So, just for complete completeness, I ran setup-plt -c. I still have 
 the problems.
 
 I guess the next step is to try it under X.
