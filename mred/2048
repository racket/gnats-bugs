>Description:
The error message below doesn't make sense: area-container<%> isn't
a class and the error should be a horizontal-panel% error.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (instantiate horizontal-panel% () (parent (make-object frame% "frame")) (border #t))
initialization for a area-container<%> class: expects argument of type <exact integer in [0, 1000]>; given true

State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 10 16:58:45 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    I improved the error message slightly, but it
    still doesn't say `horizontal-panel%', because the
    exception-raising code is shared, and its difficult to
    get the class name at the site of the raise.
