>Description:
I mention a redrawing bug below, but there is also the
problem that the code below does not draw the radio box
with a single item so that it lines up with the message
box beside it. That is, there appears to be an asymmetric
amount of space at the top and bottom of the radio box.
This is not critical, but it looks funny where there are
an odd number of radio choice items with a message next
to them.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. run the program below
;; 2. click the button
;; 3. see the radio box draw wrong
;; 4. cover and uncover the window to refresh the screen.
;; 5. see the radio box correctly
;; 6. repeat from 2 (ie, moving both ways causes the bug)

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define hp (make-object horizontal-panel% f))
(define msg (make-object message% "aaaaaaaaa" hp))
(define radio-box (make-object radio-box% #f '("aaaaaaaaa") hp void))
(make-object button% "button" f
  (letrec ([h (lambda ()
                (set! f g)
                (send hp change-children
                      (lambda (l) (list radio-box))))]
           [g (lambda ()
                (set! f h)
                (send hp change-children
                      (lambda (l) (list msg radio-box))))]
           [f h])
    (lambda x
      (f))))
(send hp set-alignment 'center 'center)
(send f show #t)
