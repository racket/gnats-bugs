>Description:
Motif and Windows allow selecting text with the keyboard.  (Emacs
does as well if you load the 'pc-selection package.)

The idea is:  you hold down the shift key and start moving the
cursor with the arrows; whatever is between the point at which
you started and the current cursor location is selected.

DrScheme does not follow this standard behavior.  (It's quite
annoying actually!)

>How-To-Repeat:
To see the behavior, try a Motif/Windows program with a text 
field.  (For example, try Netscape and open the DrScheme Bug
Report Form, or try Windows Notepad or Microsoft Word.)

Type in three lines of text:

      aaaaaaa
      bbbXbbb
      ccccccc

Position the cursor at the X.  Hold down shift and press the
UP arrow.  Then press the DOWN arrow.  Your cursor should now
be where you started, so no text is selected in Motif/Windows.

DrScheme will select aaaa\nbbbXbbb\nccc.
