>Description:
A list-box% with more entries than are visible on the screen does not interpret mouse wheel-down events but handles wheel-up events correctly on Mac OS X.

Tested on: OS X 10.5.5
>How-To-Repeat:
; copy & paste the following program and run it on OS X
; select a visible entry and use the mouse wheel to scroll down
; --> the list-box doesn scroll down (bug)
; scroll down manually with the scroll bar and select an entry at the end of the list
; use the mouse wheel to scroll up
; --> the list-box scrolls up
; This was only tested on OS X 10.5.5.

         (choices (build-list 1000 (lambda (n) (format "Entry ~a" n))))))
    
    (super-new)
    (init-display)))

  (send (new testframe%
       (width 600)
