>Description:
When I click Execute, my program runs and then gives a sensible error message.
However, when I click Execute 2 to 7 times, it dumps core with a segfault
or a bus error.  (Yes, I know there's no draw-elipse.)  It does the same
thing in x-drscheme (ie. 100) and in my copy 100d18.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the language to MrEd.
Enter open this program:
(define shape-canvas%
  (class canvas% (parent)
    (sequence (super-init parent))
    (inherit get-dc)
    (override
      (on-paint
       (lambda ()
         (let ([dc (get-dc)])
           (send dc draw-rectangle 20 30 50 70)
           (send dc draw-elipse 90 100 50 70)))))))

(define f (make-object frame% "Shapes" #f 400 500))
(define can (make-object shape-canvas% f))
(send f show #t)

Click Execute a bunch of times.

 I fixed the bug, and it no longer crashes for me under Linux. I've
 released a new Solaris binary; can you try it out?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
