>Description:
I had told my students how they could copy images from a Web page and paste them directly into DrScheme, then manipulate them with the image-manipulation functions.  One of my students (who uses a Mac, BTW), complained that she was unable to do this.  I had encountered this problem before with old browser versions, but she assured me she had the latest versions of both Firefox and Safari.  She brought in her laptop and I, too, was unable to copy-and-paste an image from either browser into DrScheme: sometimes I got nothing, sometimes I got the URL of the image (depending on browser).
I demonstrated a workaround to her: save the image from the browser onto the local hard disk, and then use the "Special...Insert Image" command, and she understands how to do that.  (The TIFF and PICT files showed up as "broken image" icons, but GIF, PNG, and JPEG worked.)
So then I turned to my own desktop machine to show her how I do it, and suddenly it didn't work on MY Mac either!  I could have sworn I was doing this successfully within the last few days, and I haven't changed DrScheme, Firefox, or the OS in that time.

I just tried the same operation on my Windows machine (same version of DrScheme, even older version of Firefox), and it worked perfectly well.
>How-To-Repeat:
This appears to be Mac-specific, but I tried both Firefox 1.5 and Firefox 2.0.  DrScheme 360 in all cases.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:48:29 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
