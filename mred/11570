>Description:
I just downloaded the nightly build for 5.0.99.5 "Full Racket", PPC version, installed it into the Applications folder as usual, opened the folder, double-clicked the DrRacket logo, and it bounced in the dock for a few seconds before dying.

So I tried 5.0.99.5 "Racket" instead; same result.

I'm writing this bug report using the 5.0.2 release.

I haven't tried building from source because I don't have git running on this old PPC machine.

 I've pushed a repair to avoid a dependence on Objective-C v2.0, and
 I'll double-check that it solves the problem after the next nightly
 build.
