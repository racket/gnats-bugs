>Description:
When a clickback pops a menu up, the menu doesn't appear until after the button is released.
Unfortunately, it is now too late to popup a menu, since a menu requires the mouse to be down.

I am not sure that this should be fixed in the code, but the docs should make a note of this
funny interaction in the clickback section.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "SendCode" #f 100 100))
(define text (make-object text%))
(define canvas (make-object editor-canvas% frame text))

(send text insert "clickback")
(send text set-clickback 0 (send text last-position)
      (lambda XX
        (let ([menu (make-object popup-menu% "Menu")])
          (make-object menu-item% 
                       "item"
                       menu
                       (lambda YY
                         (get-text-from-user
                          "Rename Identifier"
                          "Rename ? to:"
                          #f
                          "?")))
          (send canvas popup-menu menu 10 10))))

(send frame show #t)

 `set-clickback' takes a `call-on-down?' argument.

 Right; that solves the problem. Do you mind mentioning menus in the 
 documentation at that point?
