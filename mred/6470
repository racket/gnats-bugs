 I was about to move this to you when I saw that you already took it
 and removed it.  It seems to be about the backspace mapping which I
 thought was a preference-settable issue, but the default (on all
 platforms) should not be doing that.  Should this go to Matthew?

 I don't think that this has anything to do with me. I think it is 
 Matthew's (or not a bug).

 Certainly looks like a bug, at least to innocent Windows users who
 don't know that delete and backspace are expected to be confused...
