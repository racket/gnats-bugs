>Description:
On Windows ME with version 200a1, closing any DrScheme 
window (including Help Desk) will cause an Illegal 
Operation error (i.e., a Windows error). This doesn't appear
to have any adverse effects on saving files or anything,
it's just annoying. The problem does not occur on my
Windows NT box, just on Windows ME.

>How-To-Repeat:
Open Help Desk. Close Help Desk.

 By the way, there are new PLT binaries available at 
 
   http://download.plt-scheme.org/binaries/pre-release/windows-x86/
 
 Make sure to save your old ones!
 
 You might try to see if the new binaries fix your problem.
