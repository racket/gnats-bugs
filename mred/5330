>Description:
I'm having a hard time compiling the Unix version for Mac OS X. Here's what I'm getting at the end of my make:

gcc -g -O2 -Wall  -DUSE_SENORA_GC  -I./../include -c ./port.c -o port.o
./port.c: In function `scheme_init_port':
./port.c:451: warning: implicit declaration of function `fcntl'
./port.c:451: `F_SETFL' undeclared (first use in this function)
./port.c:451: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
./port.c:451: for each function it appears in.)
./port.c:451: `FNDELAY' undeclared (first use in this function)
./port.c: In function `file_char_ready':
./port.c:2335: structure has no member named `_cnt'
make[5]: *** [port.o] Error 1
make[4]: *** [all] Error 2
make[3]: *** [mzlibrary] Error 2
make[2]: *** [normal-bin] Error 2
make[1]: *** [bin] Error 2
make: *** [mz] Error 2\

Many thanks,

Dan Parvaz

 1. Senora GC is not known to work with OS X. Try to get things 
 running without it first.
 2. It appears you have not seen the instructions in 
 plt/src/mac/README.  This is understandable, because the instructions 
 in plt/src/README are a little ambiguous on this issue. I have 
 clarified these instructions slightly and exp-tagged the change.
 
 Please let me know if you continue to have problems with this build, 
 or if there are places where the documentation needs work.
 
 Thanks,
 
 john
