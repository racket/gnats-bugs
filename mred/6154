(as in summary)

- open DrScheme.
- Select Menu "Show/Hide Definitions".
- Select Menu "Show/Show Definitions" near very top of menu/screen edge.
- and repeate the sequence a few times
if nessisary, until all the top-level menu
items become highlighted simutaniously,
where then the selection of a menu item
then visually de-highlights it.

 Very nice!  I've seen this effect many times, but never such a concise 
 way of repeating it.  Thanks!
