>Description:
The editor-stream-out class lost the put method. It was in previous
versions on all three platforms and is currently in the manual. I
didn't see anything in the release notes about a change.

Without this, I cannot save my work.

 Fixed for the next release.
 
 Meanwhile, use the equivalent `<<' method for 1-argument calls to
 `put'. If you need the 2-argument form of `put', I'll speed up the
 102/3 release.

 I do not need the two argument form.
 
 Thanks for the pointer!
