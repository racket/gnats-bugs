>Description:
Get-file implicitly promises to return a valid pathname,
or #f (the return type in the docs has a typo -- the word
"object" doesn't belong). But, it can return the empty
string sometimes. I assume that this is an invalid pathname
since all pathnames must begin with "X:" for some letter
X.
>How-To-Repeat:
(get-file)
;; type D;\ into the window at the bottom and hit return
;; and the empty string is the result of get-file.

 I haven't been able to reproduce this. (I tried replcing "D" with "C",
 since my machine doesn't have a "D:".)
 
 In case it's relevant, what version of Windows are you running?

 Windows 95.

State-Changed-When: Wed Apr 19 09:23:28 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Fixed in 102/11, at least to the degree that Windows problems can be
circumvented.

Windows 98 reliably produces #f when the user provides such input, but
I tried Windows 95, and reproduced the problem. MrEd now watches for
an empty string returned by the dialog and converts it to #f.

The dialog really shouldn't go away at all, but someone at Microsoft
would have to fix that.
