>Description:
Something is wrong with MrEd's event handling on X.  It seems like
this is related to the X server in some way since it behaves
differently on an XFree86 and on an Exceed emulation.  The reason
could be that something is wrong with using the timestamps but I
don't know enough to have a more educated guess.

This problem happens with the CVS version, but I just checked and
both have been there in 103 as well.  The Exceed problem described
below is something that I assumed wrong in Exceed, but now I think
that maybe the problem is that this might be a synchronization
problem too.

>How-To-Repeat:
On XFree86 -- click somewhere on text and move the mouse away
quickly: the selection starts somewhere on the mouse way instead
of at the original location.

On Exceed -- the above works fine, but something else that is
wrong happens when you switch to a Windows window usint alt-tab.

 I think this is an XFree86 problem that's been around forever. The X
 serever generates an extra mouse click.
 
 If it's an XFree86 problem, you should see the same effect with other
 programs. though.

 Can you be more specific?
 
 Thanks,
