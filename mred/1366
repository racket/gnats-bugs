>Description:
When double clicking on a file in the finder for the first time, 
drscheme comes to the front but it does not actually open that file.
Same thing for mzscheme and same thing when a file is dragged onto
either mzscheme or mred.

Dragging a file onto a mred window never works. The os rejects the
drag.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define my-frame%
  (class frame% ()
    (override
      [on-drop-file 
       (lambda x
         (printf "~s~n" x))])
    (sequence (super-init "frame" #f 100 100))))

(define f (make-object my-frame%))
(send f accept-drop-files #t)
(send f show #t)
;; double click on a file in the finder with mred's creator
;; nothing happens.
;; do it again.
;; see printout.

;; dragging that same file onto the window also doesn't work.
