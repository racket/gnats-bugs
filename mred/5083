>Description:
This is running under KDE, with
enlightenment as window manager,
and the forceFocus resource left
as the default. Also, resize while
dragging is turned on (I think that 
is the default).

>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. run the code below
;; 2. drag the sizing thingy so the
;;    frame no longer shows both editor canvases
;; 3. Continue holding down the mouse
;;    button until things stop flashing
;;    around. 
;; 4. Release the mouse button.
;;
;; at this point, expect the window to
;; pop back open to the minimum size, but
;; it doesn't.

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define hp (make-object horizontal-panel% f))
(define ec1 (make-object editor-canvas% hp))
(define ec2 (make-object editor-canvas% hp))
(send ec1 min-width 200)
(send ec2 min-width 200)
(send f show #t)

Reason>>> Fixed a while back. MrEd now tells the window
manager about minimum and maximum frame sizes.
