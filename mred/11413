>Description:
C-left cannot go over an empty line.  (I think that gr1 had a
similar problem.)  To see this type "x", enter, enter, C-left
-- and the cursor doesn't move.

C-right has something weirder: erase the buffer completely,
then type enter, enter, enter, "x", enter, C-home, C-right --
note that the cursor is right before the "x" instead of after
it.  Now, without erasing the text type C-home, enter, enter,
C-home, C-right -- and the cursor ends up somewhere in the
middle of the block of empty lines.

 Just in case it wasn't clear, I believe c:left is bound to
 backword-word and c:right is bound to forward-word, which seem to be
 two of the built-in keybindings (coming from gracket directly).
