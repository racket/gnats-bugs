>Description:
The documentation for gui-utils:get-choice only mentions
the effect of mouse button clicks on the return value.

It does not mention that it returns #f when Escape is pressed,
or the frame is closed via a window button.
>How-To-Repeat:
I had lots of:

(gui-utils:get-choice "Delete all files on hard drive?"
                      "Cancel" "Ok"
                      "Question")

and people pressed Escape out of panic.

 Excellent point! Here is a patched version of gui-utils:get-choice.
 What do you think?
 
   
   (define get-choice
     (case-lambda 
      [(message true-choice false-choice) (get-choice message
 true-choice false-choice "Warning")]
      [(message true-choice false-choice title)
       (letrec ([result #f]
 	       [dialog (make-object 
                         (class dialog% ()
                           (override
                             [can-close?
                              (lambda ()
                                (bell)
                                (message-box title
                                             (format "Please choose
 either \"~a\" or \"~a\""
                                                     true-choice false-choice))
                                #f)])
                           (sequence
                             (super-init title))))]
 	       [on-true
 		(lambda args
 		  (set! result #t)
 		  (send dialog show #f))]
 	       [on-false
 		(lambda rags
 		  (set! result #f)
 		  (send dialog show #f))]
 	       [vp (make-object vertical-panel% dialog)]
 	       [hp (make-object horizontal-panel% dialog)])
         
 	(let loop ([m message])
 	  (let ([match (regexp-match (format "^([^~n]*)~n(.*)")
 				     m)])
 	    (if match
 		(begin (make-object message% (cadr match) vp)

 	(send vp set-alignment 'left 'center)
 	(send hp set-alignment 'right 'center)
 	(send (make-object button% true-choice hp on-true '(border)) focus)
 	(make-object button% false-choice hp on-false)
 	(send dialog center 'both)
 	(send dialog show #t)
 	result)]))

 Sorry for the late reply; I've been terribly swamped.
 
 I don't think forcing the user to use on of the choices is the right
 thing.  You just need to make sure that clicking on the close button
 does the right thing.  It would be better to have an optional argument
 returned in the case of a close button press.

State-Changed-Why:

Added an argument that specifies the result when the dialog is
clsed. Defaults to a flag that indicates the dialog should not allow the
close button to be clicked.
