>Description:
On my Vista Pro SP1 (yeah, I know, don't laugh) the Open File dialog box sort of "freezes" and I have to move the mouse in and out the dialog to unfreeze it (weird isn't it?).

It's the same for the Save dialog box.

All the versions of DrScheme that I have tested on this machine (from 4.1.5 ?) have been doing that.

I don't know if the problem comes from my machine or from DrScheme, but no other software on my machine does that, so...
>How-To-Repeat:
For example, I open the dialog, it shows up correctly except that the cursor doesn't blink.
I click on a directory, nothing happens, I move the mouse out of the dialog, it unfreezes for a quarter of a second, and the directory gets selected and opens, but then it freezes again.
I type a name in the text field, nothing happens. I move the mouse in the dialog and the text gets typed.
Again, it unfreezes for a split second, and so on.

 This bug seems to be fixed in the last version (4.2.2).
 I suggest to close it then?
 
 Thanks for the bugfix,
 Laurent
