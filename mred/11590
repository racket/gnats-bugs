>Description:
The "retrieve" method of the handin server is working fine
on 5.0.2, but not working on 5.0.99.6.  In particular, I
spent a good deal of time tracking it down and it looks
like the problem is that the way that the handin-server 
opens a new window is failing silently. I'll attach a 
.plt file containing a totally-stripped-down collection
that is self-contained (no handin-server interaction left)
and illustrates the bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install attached .plt file in 5.0.99.6
Restart DrRacket
Click the big "read-from-file/POLY" button.
See a blank buffer.

Now, try opening the "example.rkt" contained in the 
collection explicitly.  Voila! file exists.

 But there is something about drracket or the framework or something
 that is coming into play here, because simply adding this
 
 (define-runtime-path example-file "./example.rkt")
 (define-runtime-path icon-file "./icon.png")
 
 (define t (new text%))
 (send t load-file example-file)
 
 to client-gui.rkt near the top works fine.

 FWIW, this looks like a bug in text% (or something at that level).
 When I change the button callback to something more sane, like:
 
 
                 (lambda (button)
                   (define defs (send
 (drracket:unit:open-drscheme-window) get-definitions-text))
                   (send defs load-file example-file)
                   (send defs set-filename #f))
 
 I get the error below (note that if I pass 'standard directly I still
 get that error).
 
 
 set-file-format method of text%: expects argument of type <'standard,
 'text, or 'text-force-cr>; given 'guess

 Ah. This is a bug:
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define fn (make-temporary-file))
 (call-with-output-file fn
   (=CE=BB (port)
     (fprintf port "hi\n"))
   #:exists 'truncate)
 (define t (new text%))
 (send t lock #t)
 (send t load-file fn)
 
 ;; =3D>  collects\mred\private\wxme\text.rkt:2735:2: set-file-format
 method of text%: expects argument of type <'standard, 'text, or
 'text-force-cr>; given 'guess
 
 And this seems to be the root cause of that bug:
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define t (new text%))
 (define port (open-input-string "hi"))
 (send t lock #t)
 (send t insert-port port)
 ;; =3D> 'guess
 
 I don't yet understand why the editor is locked at this point in time,
 tho. That doesn't seem right.

 Okay, I've pushed a change that makes this work better. Thanks for all
 the work to make a smaller example!
 
 I think that a second change has to happen in the handin collection,
 so I didn't push that one, since that code is doing low-level things
 that I'm not sure are right.
 
 Specifically, this function:
 
 (define (string->editor! str defs)
   (let* ([base (make-object editor-stream-in-bytes-base% str)]
          [stream (make-object editor-stream-in% base)])
     (read-editor-version stream base #t)
     (read-editor-global-header stream)
     (send defs read-from-file stream)
     (read-editor-global-footer stream)))
 
 should probably call the erase method, ie should be this function:
 
 (define (string->editor! str defs)
   (send defs erase)
   (let* ([base (make-object editor-stream-in-bytes-base% str)]
          [stream (make-object editor-stream-in% base)])
     (read-editor-version stream base #t)
     (read-editor-global-header stream)
     (send defs read-from-file stream)
     (read-editor-global-footer stream)))
 
 but all this makes me wonder why this code isn't just using
 insert-from-port or, for that matter, opening a file dialog for the
 user to just save the file (and then maybe also opening the file in
 drracket too).

 (BTW, regardless of the bug, it's very likely that I did the wrong

 so feel free to fix anything that looks bad.)

 It looks to me like you want to open the file in a new tab/frame (as
 dictated by the prefs) and drracket doesn't really support that at the
 moment. (YOu have to have the thing actually saved in a file to do
 that.)
 
 Is that what you'd wanted to do?

 The idea is that you use the "submit" button to send your file, and
 then you use the "retrieve" thing (which would have been another
 button, but I was trying to avoid the extra space) to get the content
 locally.  So they can be used as a kind of save/load features.  (I
 also considered hooking them as save/load, but you can set up checkers
 that forbid all kinds of submissions, which will make it a poor
 save-substitute.)

 Well, neither of the reasonable options I see do that. I can either
 make it save the file on the disk, or I can make it open the file in
 an unsaved editor in what seems like a reasonable way to me. Any
 preference?

 IIUC, I think the unsaved editor makes for better student workflow.

 Probably best to leave it as is, then.
