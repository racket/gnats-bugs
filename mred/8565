>Description:
The remove method of a pasteboard, according to the manual, should let me re-insert the snip I removed into another pasteboard (or, presumably the same one).

It doesn't seem to do that.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; I expected the code below to print a snip, but it prints #f.

(define pb (new pasteboard%))
(define es (new editor-snip%))
(send pb insert es)
(send pb remove es)
(send pb insert es)
(printf "~s\n" (send pb find-first-snip))
