>Description:
On the Vaio, DrScheme sometimes splits the cursor.  The problem
also occurs in the MrEd REPL.  Just start it up and move up and
down over the welcome text.  You will often get a split cursor.
The blinking part is in the right position, but an image of the
cursor (unblinking) is left behind sometimes.  The two are of
different colors.  In the theme I'm using (Matisse <-:), the regular
cursor alternates between black and blue as a form of blinking.
The left-behind-cursor is blue, the blinking one is orange.

You can find the Matisse themes on several sites, including

http://www.softseek.com/Desktop_Enhancements/Desktop_Themes/Art/3index.html

I've had this problem with several different themes.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download and install theme
Run MrEd
Move cursor up and down

 It has nothing to do with themes or cursor colors. 
 This has happened to me BEFORE I installed a theme
 or a switched or color or whatever (and I reported 
 it in short email message to VAIO users).

 The caret should never be blue or orange. It should either be black or
 white.
 
 Also, a canvas (or empty editor) should be white. Does the theme
 somehow change the color of a canvas?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 This may be a theme thing.  The theme does mess with all sorts of
 pointer objects (sorry).  The i-bar cursor, for instance, has a green
 top bar, pink/purple vertical, and blue bottom bar.  But I haven't
 seen any change in the blinking cursor in Netscape forms.

 The canvas is indeed white.

 The MrEd program below should create a frame with an "Xor" button and a
 white canvas. Whenever you hit the button, it should xor the outline of
 a 100x100 black square in the canvas.
 
 When you click the button twice, do you get a blue square or an empty
 canvas?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 (define f (make-object frame% "Test" #f 300 300))

 			 (let* ([dc (send c get-dc)]
 				[p (send dc get-pen)])
 			   (send dc set-pen 
 				 (send the-pen-list find-or-create-pen
 				       "black" 1 'xor))
 			   (send dc draw-rectangle 100 100 100 100)))))
 
 (send f show #t)

 When I click the button once, I get a a box within the canvas.  The
 box has yellow sides and a blue top and bottom.
 
 When I click a second time, nothing changes.  Likewise for all
 subsequent clicks.
 
 If you want additional experiments, I'd be happy to perform them.

 Just so you know: None of this makes any sense.
 
 When I see problems like this in X, it's invariably due to a broken
 display driver. Xor with a black pen simply isn't xoring correctly. 
 
 But I don't see any complaints on the net about the Z505-SX, and it
 doesn't sound like any other program is misbehaving for you.
 
 If there's something wrong with MrEd, it's surprising that it doesn't
 cause problems on other machines (including my 505-TR). Maybe there's
 something about the screen's number of colors or size. Tell me more
 about the resolution and depth of your screen.

 Your other comments are fine, but I haven't used any other program
 enough to be sure.  The only other editor I use is XEmacs, and I
 haven't used it very much.  (When I have, it hasn't given me any
 trouble, but the XEmacs cursor shape is also different.)

 No problem. We demo the effect for you in Paris. -- Matthias
