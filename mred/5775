>Description:
I noticed that after loading my program that I was unable to create an executable (using Mac OS X 1.5)

The file selection dialog appears, but if I, for example, navigate to the Desktop and enter a name like test.app nothing happens.

Note that the dialog is titled "Choose a folder" but if a folder is selected without entering a file name, that also generates an error.  - try it.

Thanks,
Mark

1. load any program

 Sorry -- the interface is a bit confusing. You must create and select a
 directory. So, either choose an existing application (which is a
 directory, but hidden to you) or use the button on the dialog that
 makes a directory and then choose the new directory.
