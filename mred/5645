>Description:
In the part "on-paint in text:delegate-mixin", the following appears in the HTML rendered version:

[{\rawscm{size-cache-invalid}}].

It's a link to: doc/framework/framework.hlog
which shows this error at the bottom:

imethod_C_editor_C__C_size-cache-invalid, method_C_procedure_C__C_preferences_C_add-misc-checkbox-panel

 I can't seem to find this. If you could send me the url of the page
 that would help me.
 
 Below is the entire page I have which, as you can see, doesn't have
 size-cache-invalid on it.

 on-paint in text:delegate-mixin
 
 
 
 Provides a way to add arbitrary graphics to an editor's display. This method is called just before and just after every painting of the editor.
 
 The on-paint method, together with the snips' draw methods, must be able to draw the entire state of an editor. Never paint directly into an editor's display canvas except from within on-paint or draw. Instead, put all extra drawing code within on-paint and call invalidate-bitmap-cache when part of the display needs to be repainted.
 
 If an on-paint method uses cached location information, then the cached information should be recomputed in response to a call of invalidate-bitmap-cache.
 
 The on-paint method must not make any assumptions about the state of the drawing context (e.g., the current pen), except that the clipping region is already set to something appropriate. Before on-paint returns, it must restore any drawing context settings that it changes.
 
 The editor is internally locked for writing and reflowing during a call to this method (see also Locks).

 The before? argument is #t when the method is called just before a painting the contents of the editor or #f when it is called after painting. The left, top, right, and bottom arguments specify which region of the editor is being repainted, in editor coordinates. To get the coordinates for dc, offset editor coordinates by adding (dx, dy). See Caret for information about draw-caret.

 This appears to be a problem with the expansion of the \edlocation
 macro, when it shows up in the framework manual.
