>Description:
The "print interactions" and "print definitions" commands in the "File"
menu produces prints in very very small fonts. (so small that the printed
version is readable only with a decent microscope...)

Increasing the fonts format by 1000% helps, but then the on-screen versions
of the definitions and interactions become unreadable because making
them too large...

This is a small bug, but it's very annoying.

 Does your print dialog have a "properties" button where you can set
 the scale for printing (rather than setting the global scale, which
 changes the screen font)?
 
 Meanwhile, we're looking at ways to get the default printing size
 right (for all kinds of Windows printers).
