>Description:
When there aren't enough colors to do the pink highlighting, 
we use black.  That's fine. However, the problem is that this 
text is then _selected_.  That is, it is replaced by typing.
>How-To-Repeat:
start drs in 256 colors.
execute (+ 1 'a)
press space bar.
Damn! it's gone.

 This is the expected behavior. Having two different means for reverse 
 video text would be worse, IMO.
