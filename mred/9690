>Description:
MrEd doesn't set XtNinput resource for it's frame windows (XWMHints.input field). When this hint is not set to True, window manager may not assign keyboard focus to that window. This behaviour can be seen when mred or drscheme is started in WindowMaker or XFCE. Maybe in some others too.

Here's trivial patch that works for me:

     return TRUE;
 }
