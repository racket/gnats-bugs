>Environment:
linux-other
>Description:
Sometimes, a button can appear depressed even when it has
not been fully clicked and the callback isn't called
(it even doesn't pop back up (graphically) until it is 
clicked again)
>How-To-Repeat:
open drscheme (or anything with menus and buttons)
push and release the alt key (this leaves a menu up)
click a button while the menu is up.

the menu goes away, and the button depresses, but
it never comes back and the callback isn't called.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:35:28 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
