>Description:
I really dislike this.  There is a work-around: instantiating a 
new bitmap% with a freshly allocated string stolen from the bmp
file.  But I don't think this should be necessary.  1-bit-per-pixel
bmp files are the only compact binary option for storing 
monochrome bitmaps in drscheme; I urge their support.
>How-To-Repeat:
(send a-bitmap load-file "my-mono-bitmap.bmp" 'bmp)
(send a-bitmap is-color?) ;; ==> #t
