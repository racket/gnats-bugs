This is from Philip Blaiklock, philipb@owlnet, from the comp210 newsgroup.

Dr. Scheme is beginning to nag with me with its intermittent crashes on
my win95  16mbRAM Pentium system.  It typically does this:

MRED caused an invalid page fault in
module KERNEL32.DLL at 0137:bff9a29c.

Stack dump:

Any elaborations/explanations/etc? Is this a common problem?

BTW, my system is a p75 overclocked to 100.  I doubt (but haven't ruled
out) that this is the cause...I can run my machine at 100 for hours and
hours on end and Quake, which is quite intensive, runs flawlessly. There
is probably no overheating.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
This could be any number of things that have already been fixed since
47 was released. Probably MrEd is running out of memory a lot of the
time. Other possibilities include problems related to the event loop,
problems with the primitive find file dialog, and problems with the
printing dialog. In any case, it is unfortunately true that
"intermittent crashes" can rarely be fixed; only repeatable crashes
are likely to have a solution.

The problems are, of course, 1000 times more likely to be in MrEd than
the hardware.
