>Description:
I noticed two problems with the transcript below, 
under macos x. First, the set-selection calls don't
actually change the GUI. Second, the error message
has a misspelling in it (tabls).
>How-To-Repeat:
Welcome to DrScheme, version 206.1-cvs9feb2004.

> (send tp set-selection 2)
set-selection in tab-panel%: panel has only 2 tabls, indexed 0 to 1; given out-of-range index: 2

 On a related note, when there are too many tabs to fit (horizontally)
 the leftmost and rightmost ones just get lost.
