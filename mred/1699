>Description:
In both the definitions and interactions window, text is
not scrolled while holding the mouse button down and moving
the vertical scroll bar. Text is not scrolled until after
releasing the mouse button. It would be nice to see the
scrolling right away (like in ms-word). If I remember well
earlier versions did show the scrolling immediately.
Kind Regards, Jos Koot

 You remember correctly. I think a bug fix to avoid certain Windows
 problems in 103 made scrolling work less well, though I'm not entirely
 sure why. We hope to fix it soon.
 
 Thanks for the bug report,
 Matthew
