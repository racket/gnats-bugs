 Quoting robby@cs.rice.edu:
 > pasteboard's on-resize not called when editor-snip objects get bigger
 
 You want `resized', not `on-resize'. The former is called by a snip in
 the pasteboard. The latter is called by the pasteboard itself in
 response to a call on its `resize' method.
 
 I'll fix the docs for `on-resize' to clarify.
