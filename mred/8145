>Description:
After using drscheme for a couple of minutes, editing and running very simple commands, the performance degrades very fast.
The process takes up over a hundred megabytes of my RAM, and cpu usage goes to 100% even when I am just typing this bug report...
>How-To-Repeat:
I am using the latest DrScheme package from the website (350) on a Debian GNU/Linux Unstable distro.
The hardware is an Athlon64 system met 1Gb of ram.
There are no special steps to reproduce, it happens every time after a few minutes of usage. After ten minutes it becomes so bad, that I can gradually see the letters coming on the screen as I type, with the "mred" process taking 100% of the cpu time.

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:02 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
