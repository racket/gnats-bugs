>Description:
I would have narrowed this down further, but each time I try
this I have to force mred to exit. Then, my machine started
crashing (during startup, no less) so I'm not going to mess
with this anymore.
>How-To-Repeat:
- evaluate the code below
- click around on the frame that comes up.
  eventually, the bitmap will stop drawing
  sometimes I just click, sometimes I have to hide and unhhide
  the window
- mred is frozen, even the repl window.

 Is this problem mac-specific? I'm not able to reproduce the problem in
 Linux, so far.

 It appears to be. It was never hard for me to reproduce on the mac. 
 It just takes some clicking around. Under solaris with MacX, it 
 doesn't seem to happen.

 Actually, I found a way to make it stuck: select the bitmap, which
 implies a copy.
 
 My first guess is that both problems are related to the synchronization
 that makes certain Scheme-implemented parts of MrEd single-threaded. In
 any case, I'll work on the copy problem, which may shed light on the
 Mac problem.
