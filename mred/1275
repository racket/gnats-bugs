MrEd stops with a segmentation fault on a RedHat 6.0.
This is probably some X library thing since it works
fine when I recompile it. [I think that there was some
similar story with v.100]

>How-To-Repeat:
use a RedHat 6.0 machine, run mred.

 Hi Eli -- 
 
 Thanks for the bug report. Because you're a sophisticated user, we need
 your advice.
 
 We are fully aware of the problem with DrScheme on Linux. The download page
 for Linux explains the problem with a warning. Do you believe that this
 warning is not enough for our consumers? What should we do to advertise the 
 "recompile unless you're running 6.1" strategy? 
 
 Thanks -- Matthias

 OK, I have now an answer from the Debian potato guy, it works fine
 there as well.

 Yeah - I was surprised for discovering this so late...

 I forgot to say that this is only on Unix.
