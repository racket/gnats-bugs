>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
1. Enter this program to the definitions pane of DrSchem
(define display-editor%
  (class text%
    (super-instantiate () (auto-wrap #t))
    (inherit insert)
    (public display-string)

    (define display-string
      (lambda (str)
        (do-display (open-input-string str))))
    
    (define do-display
      (lambda (i-port)
        (if (and (char-ready? i-port)
                 (not (eof-object? (peek-char i-port))))
            (let ([snp (make-object string-snip% (read-line i-port))])
              (unless (eof-object? (peek-char i-port))
                (send snp set-flags (cons 'hard-newline (send snp get-flags))))
              (insert snp)
              (do-display i-port))
            (void))))))
              
              

(define f (instantiate frame% () (label "test") (min-width 300) (min-height 300)))
(define c (instantiate editor-canvas% () (parent f)))
(define de (instantiate display-editor% ()))
(send c set-editor de)
(send f show #t)

(send de display-string (format "this is a~ntest and only a test"))
2. Execute
3. In the "test" window position the cursor on the firs line
4. Type

RESULTS:
1. A new line is created for each character typed.
2. New characters appear on all lines when you type
3. Ultimately it crashes
