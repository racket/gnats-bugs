>Description:
	When selecting a long (unwrapped) line in mred, the view (ie scroll
bars) jump around too much.
>How-To-Repeat:
- open an editor window in mred. 
- make a line that's about 1.5x as wide as the canvas. 
- turn off wrapping. 
- move the scroll bar all the way to the right.
- start selecting about halfway down the visible length of the long line
  and continue to almost the end
- now move the mouse up a little

When the mouse moves up the canvas jumps left which makes it hard to select
long lines.
