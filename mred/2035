>Description:
the 'dot, 'long-dash, and 'short-dash pen styles are not exactly
right,  think. For me, the 'dot and the 'short-dash look exactly
the same and the 'long-dash is looks more like how I would have
expected a 'short-dash to look.

If it were up to me, I'd rename the cuurent 'long-dash to 'short-dash
and add a new 'long-dash whose gaps were about the size of the
current long-dash's filled in spots and whose filled in spots
were twice that long.

(also, I'd be clever with any remainder and divide it up amoung
the middle gaps so that the end points are always connected
to the end of a dash, but that's just icing)

 In fact, it gets worse. With the program below (same thing, just 
 vertical not horizonal), all lines are dotted. There are no dashed 
 lines.
