>Description:
I'm using DrScheme in OS X. When I save a file, it does not seem to associate with DrScheme. I can open the file from within DrScheme, but not by double-clicking on it. In addition, when I submit the file to a web-based server and then retrieve it (to check and make sure the transaction went well), it is a blank document. What's up?
>How-To-Repeat:
Write some functions in the def window (everything works). save file. Close DrScheme, and attempt to open file by double clicking on it. 
>Fix:
