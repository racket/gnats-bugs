 Sorry - I forgot about this one:
 
 Quoting svdh@cs.rice.edu:

 Do you know how the rest of the system decides what a double-click is?
 
 MrEd/X provides an obscure way to select the speed of a double click.
 The mred.doubleClickTime resource determines the maximum number of
 milliseconds that separate a double click. The default is 500
 milliseconds:
 
    mred.doubleClickTime:	500
 
 Is the problem that 500 milliseconds is too short, or that
 double-clicks within this range don't seem to be captured?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Good news - I finally found the toolbox command that MrEd should be
 using:
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 XT FUNCTIONS                             XtSetMultiClickTime(3Xt)
 
 NAME
      XtSetMultiClicktime, XtGetMultiClickTime - set and get
      multi-click times
 
 SYNTAX
      void XtSetMultiClickTime(display, time)
            Display* display;
            int time;
 
      int XtGetMultiClickTime(display)
            Display* display;
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 So this will be fixed in 103.1.
