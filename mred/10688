 Let's take big-bang out of the equation:=20
 
 (define song "/Users/matthias/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Antonio =
 Vivaldi/The Four Seasons/01 Con No 1 in E RV 269 Spring-Allegro.mp3")
 
 (define music=20
   (thread
    (lambda ()=20
      (printf "play ~a\n" song)
      (printf "---> ~s\n" (play-sound song #f)))))
 
 (sleep 3)
 
 (kill-thread music)
 
 This shows that killing the thread doesn't kill the underlying process =
 of playing the sound but -- at least in principle -- it should.=20
