 (wx:find-path 'pref-file) appears to be returning this bad filename.
 
 Robby

From: mflatt

 Yes. And presumably the directory doesn't exist, and this presumably
 this non-existent directory is specified by the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH
 environment variables.

 So you're "X" on this one, Robby?

 (I assume there's no confusion about the form of the pathname, which
 is fine; slashes and backslashes can be mixed.)

From: Robby

 Oh, I didn't know about the slashes mixing. However, I thought that
 wx:find-path is supposed to return a path that I can use? I am not doing
 any checking of the pathname or anything.

 If I cannot use that file, what should I do?

From: mflatt

 Probably wx:find-path should check for the existance of the directory.
 Meanwhile, we need to tell the user how to fix the problem.

 The mixture of slashes and backslashes is not a problem.
 
 DrScheme tries to save your preferences in a directory determined by
 the %HOMEDIRVE% and %HOMEPATH% environment variables. Are these
 environment variables set on your system to a directory that does not
 exist? If so, fixing the environment variable settings will solve the
 problem.
 
 The next version of DrScheme will silently select another directory to
 save your preferences when %HOMEDIRVE% and %HOMEPATH% determine a
 non-existent directory.
