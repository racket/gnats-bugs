>Description:
I'd love to see some improvement in the failure mode that occurs when drracket is started on Linux without a DISPLAY environment variable set.   The behavior seems to vary by platform; on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, which my students are stuck with, the error message is a bit scary (shown below).  On Debian stable the error message is less scary but still unlikely to help a beginning student: 

  Gtk initialization failed for display ":0"

I would love to see a change so that DrRacket, not Gtk, issues the error message, and perhaps points beginners to a web page where the issues are explained.

1. Get a linux command line
2. `unset DISPLAY`
3. `drracket`
