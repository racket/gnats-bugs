>Description:
	After using DrScheme for a few minutes, it started reporting
problems with current-directory and it couldn't read/write files
anymore due to FreeBSD error 24 (too many files open). (The
current-directory problem is also due to error 24.)
>How-To-Repeat:
	Use DrScheme. I have a very short autosave period (15 seconds)

More data:
 It happens even in MrEd. I set my autosave delay to 2 seconds and
my filedesc limit to 15. After about 30 seconds, (current-directory)
doesn't work anymore. All I did in MrEd is eval (current-directory)
a few times.
which may be related, but I don't know.

State-Changed-Why:
This was a FreeBSD-specific bug. In fact, it seems to be an OS bug
rather than a MrEd bug, but it is still unclear. The symptoms seem to
occur when MzScheme uses open() to get an fd representing the
directory instead of using getcwd(); this fd is then used with
fchdir() to change directories. open()/fchdir() is a lot more
efficient than getcwd()/setpwd().

MzScheme is clearly calling open() and close() correctly. But when one
fixed thread is swapped in and out with a sequence of new threads,
something goes wrong. The swapping causes from zero to two directory
fds to be active at a time. FreeBSD somehow reuses one fd id (4), but
picks a new fd id for the other (7, 8, 9, 10, ...). Eventually, it
runs out of fd ids.

I haven't been able to produce a small C program that exhibits the
problem. For now, turning off the use of open()/fchdir()/close()
solves the problem for FreeBSD. The open()/fchdir()/close() code
works fine for Solaris and Linux.
