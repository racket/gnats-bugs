turns out it's not.

Once you've got a few insert a ')' in the inner
most scheme box. The boxes will get bigger and
smaller three times (once for each ')' ']' '}'
which it tries to match the ')' to.

 The paren matcher adds and removes those extra parens inside an 
 edit-sequence, so I think your suggestion is actually that the resized 
 message shouldn't be sent during an edit sequence.
