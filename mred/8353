>Description:
Hello,

we are using DrScheme on SUSE Linux 10.0 (32bit and 64bit platform). On the 64bit platform we have got a big problem.

If someone tries to quit DrScheme the computer freezes and it is not possible to work with the machine without a reboot. On the 32bit platform this problem does not exist.

We tried it with the Linux i386 version and even compiled the Source Code for Linux directly on this machines. The problem is even the same. At the moment the students use SSH to work with DrScheme on the 32bit machines but it should be possible to work also on the 64bit machines without this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
You will need a SUSE Linux 10. Then you just start DrScheme and quit it directly after the start. The computer freezes.

 If I understand, the fact that quitting DrScheme freezes the *entire*
 system suggests a problem in the OS. Just to make sure, it's not just
 that X11 is somehow stuck: you can't even use kill -9 through a network
 connection or an alternate console?
 
 If you compiled with GL support, then you might try configuring
 --disable-gl. GL drivers are often a source of trouble.
 
 Also try setting the environment variable PLTNOMZJIT (to anything)
 before starting DrScheme. That disables the JIT compiler. I have no
 particular reason to think that the JIT could cause this kind of
 problem, but it's a relatively unusual feature of DrScheme (i.e., it
 works in a way that most other programs don't).

 it is not possible to switch to an alternate console and even a network
 connection does not work.

 Hm, this seems to work. I will test it some time.

 after some tries even by students I have to say that it does not work.
 The computer freezes ...

 This also does not help.

 Hello,
 
 the problem seems to be solved.

 There was a kernel update on December, 21st last year. This update
 seemed to solve our "freezing" problem. So it maybe was a problem with
 some libraries, etc. just on the 64bit platform.

Thanks very much for the update!
