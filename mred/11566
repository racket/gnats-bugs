>Description:
I can't seem to coax gracket into making a button bitmap that looks right. 

Running the program below produces a frame with three buttons. 

The first one uses make-bitmap to make the bitmap, but it doesn't look right because the button doesn't have the shiney ness that one would expect from a windows 7 button.

The second one uses make-screen-bitmap and does have that shininess, but somehow the label doesn't get drawn.

The third one is a variation on the second where the draw-bitmap call doesn't happen. This one loses the shininess, tho.

Subject: Re: [racket-bug] mred/11566 bitmap button labels (on windows)
Date: Sat, 1 Jan 2011 11:45:55 -0700

 The bug is fixed: In the case of the second bitmap, the conversion from
 the Win32-specific `bitmap%' to a Win32 HBITMAP had trouble that made
 it weirdly transparent --- the background as well as the text.
 
 The first and third buttons aren't shiny because the bitmap is
 `clear'ed (as opposed to `erase'ed) so that the background is white.
 With the bug repaired, that's also true for the second bitmap.
 
 Unfortunately, replacing the `clear' with `erase' for the first bitmap
 (which has an alpha channel) does not produce a nice result. Under
 Windows, drawing anti-aliased text to a bitmap with an alpha channel
 produces especially ugly output, at least in Windows 7. This seems to
 be a Cairo/Pango limitation, or else it's a misuse of Cairo/Pango that
 I cannot figure out.
 
 A more promising direction is to allow a button have both a text and
 image label (where both are drawn). It looks like Cocoa, Gtk, and Win32
 all support that combination, and so the resulting button should look
 right. I will investigate this possibility further.
 
 Another possibility is to use the old trick of rendering black text to
 a white background on a `make-screen-bitmap' kind of bitmap, and then
 using the resulting bitmap as a mask. Using that trick (to end up with
 a bitmap with an alpha channel to use as the label) would probably look
 right on all platforms.
