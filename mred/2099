Not really a bug, just an inconvenience: Apparently there's no Dr. Scheme for Mac OS X (yet), so I have to open Classic to run the program, which takes a rather long time. Just let me know if there are plans to make an OS X version anytime soon.

 Yes, there sure are.  DrScheme for OS X is scheduled for inclusion in 
 version 200, which is in the final stages of development.  It should 
 be ready for the spring semester, or sooner if you're willing to be a 
 guinea pig.
 
 Details forthcoming.
