>Description:
This applies to every text/edit control on the Bug Report Form.

I can copy any text *out* of the form and paste it into (apparently) any other DrRacket text/edit control. However, I can't paste anything into it, unless the text is on the Gnome clipboard.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a Gnome editor (like gedit). Write some text; copy it. Try to paste it on the Bug Report Form. It works.

Write some text in the DrRacket editor; copy it. Try to paste it on the Bug Report Form. It doesn't work.

Write some text in the Bug Report Form; copy it. Try to paste it anywhere on the Bug Report Form. It doesn't work. Try to paste it in the DrRacket editor. It works.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 11 Oct 2010 16:30:28 -0400
Reason>>> same as 11303; in general, GRacket wasn't putting
plain text on the clipboard correctly, and text fields
(as in the bug report form) demand plain text from the
clipboard

 This is probably my issue as well, but copy/paste from drracket to any
 other window doesn't work (I'm also in gnome).
