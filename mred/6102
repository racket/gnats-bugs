>Description:
In OS X, CMD-` now switches between windows in many
applications, including DrScheme.  I suspect that this
is OS-level behavior.  However, the keystroke also
appears to go to the application, because you also get
a ` inserted into the text.  I would suggest that this
keystroke be ignored at the MrEd level.  Also, this
means that cmd-- is now redundant, but it's probably
easier just to let this stand.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme, open a new window, hit cmd-`

 If command-~ is really going to be supported in mred somehow, I'll get
 rid of the extra stuff in the windows menu.

 Let me clarify:  I could be wrong, but it appears to me that the 
 window-switching caused by cmd-` is not implemented by MrEd but rather 
 by the OS.  As such, it will presumably not work on other platforms.  
 One possibility would be to use cmd-` as the window-switcher on all 
 platforms, but all I was really proposing was that MrEd should get out 
 of the way of the OS functionality by ignoring cmd-`.

 Yeah, but it didn't even used to do that. it used to just do nothing.

 Some apps like BBedit Lite don't seem to be affected by cmd-~ so I suspect
 that OSX's ability to sequence through the windows may depend on API and
 event loop function calls used.
 
 (in either case it would seem that window menu entries for the cmd key
 short-cut should still be present, even if in OSX the short-cut itself
 doesn't need to be handled by the app, it would seem?)

 The exp-tagged MrEd now drops [Shift-]Cmd-` events after they're
 processed in the OS-X-normal way.
 
 Like Cmd-tab (is that OS X or VirtualDesktop on my machine?) or Alt-tab
 Windows, the application gets no chance to re-map this key combination.
