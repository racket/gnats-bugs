>Description:
I'd like to create a floating frame that is centered atop its parent. According to the manual, here is how it works: 
"center in top-level-window<%>

Centers the window on the screen if it has no parent. If it has a parent, the window is centered with respect to its parent's location."
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "class.ss") (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))


(define frm1 (new frame% [label "error"][parent #f][width 200][height 200]))
(define frm2 (new frame% [label "centered"][parent #f][width 10][height 10]
                  [style '(hide-menu-bar no-caption float)]))
(define msg* (new message% [parent frm2][label "centered?"]))

(send frm1 show #t)
(send frm2 show #t)
(send frm2 center 'both)

frm2 shows up centered with respect to my laptop not frm1, 
which shows up somewhere else.

 But frm2 doesn't have a parent? The code doesn't seem to match your
 expectation, but maybe I'm confused?

 I sent in the wrong code:
 
 (require (lib "class.ss")
           (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
 
 
 (define frm1 (new frame% [label "error"][parent #f][width 200][height  
 200]))
 (define frm2 (new frame% [label "centered"][parent frm1][width 10] 
 [height 10]
                    [style '(hide-menu-bar no-caption float)]))
 (define msg* (new message% [parent frm2][label "centered?"]))
 
 (send frm1 show #t)
 (send frm2 show #t)
 (send frm2 center 'both)
