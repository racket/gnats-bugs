I'm using Gentoo Linux and XOrg. When starting DrScheme from console no error messages are displayed and the standard loading screen is shown. Next the GUI is shown but without any fonts. No fonts in the menus which are clickable but they are just empty menus. When I try to write anything in the code window, nothing is being displayed.

 It sounds like DrScheme has been compiled to use
 Xft/fontconfig/freetype fonts, but the fonts aren't actually installed.
 
 Forgive my ignorance of things Gentoo, but it sounds like you didn't
 configure the DrScheme build yourself, and instead downloaded a
 pre-configured version. Is that correct? If so, we may need to work
 toward having a dependency declared somewhere...
 
 If you configured and built yourself, then we have other problems, but
 you could at least build a usable DrScheme by supplying --disable-xft
 to the configure script.
 
 Meanwhile, I'll try to improve DrScheme to more gracefully handle the
 absence of Xft fonts, in case that is the problem.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
