>Description:
If a dc's font is set to a fixed with font, get-char-width and
get-char-height's responses do not match the size of the drawn text.

On the mac, the width is wrong and the height does not take descenders
into account. On other platforms, descenders are taken into account. I
would prefer that descenders are taken into account on all platforms.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define fixed-font
  (let* ([delta (make-object style-delta% 'change-family 'modern)]
	 [basic (send the-style-list find-named-style "Basic")]
	 [new-style (send the-style-list find-or-create-style basic delta)])
    (send new-style get-font)))  


(define frame (make-object frame% "frame"))

(define text-canvas%
  (class canvas% ()
    (inherit get-dc)
    (override
     [on-paint
      (lambda ()
	(let ([dc (get-dc)])
	  (send dc set-font fixed-font)
	  (send dc draw-rectangle 10 10 
		(inexact->exact (* 6 (send dc get-char-width)))
		(inexact->exact (send dc get-char-height)))
	  (send dc draw-text "fjfjfj" 10 10)))])
    (sequence (super-init frame))))

(define canvas (make-object text-canvas%))
(send canvas min-width 100)
(send canvas min-height 100)
(send frame show #t)
