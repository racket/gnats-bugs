>Description:
When the mouse hovers over "File", "Edit", or any of the other items on the DrRacket toolbar, the corresponding menus do not appear. The 'action' ("Edit", "Help", etc.) is highlighted, but to use the menu, you have to move your mouse to where you expect the menu to be.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Compile racket-5.0.2 from source.
2. Move mouse to the "File" button near the top of the window.
3. Click on "File" ("File" is highlighted, no menu appears).

Also, my interaction window is set to appear to the right of my definitions window. I'm pretty sure that isn't the cause of this bug, however.

 We have completely re-implemented the GUI layer for the next release.
 Can you try the current development version and let us know whether it
 works right on your system?

 Thanks for the report,

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:45:07 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
