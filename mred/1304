>Description:
(pet-peeve
 "For the record, this bug would not exist if the design of mred
  did not call for copying snips (that is, if snips were two
  objects, one for the information specific to the display 
  (coordinates, next field, etc) and the other object was the
  information global to all places where this snip is displayed
  (draw method, tight-text-fit flag, etc)")

As far as I can tell, only the attributes of an editor-snip that
the copy method preserves are the initialization arguments
(and the contents of the text). It does not preserve any others,
including tight-text-fit. I infer this from the 
implementation of `Copy' in wx_msnip.cxx. 

>How-To-Repeat:
(define e (make-object editor-snip% (make-object text%)))
(send e set-tight-text-fit #t)
(send (send e copy) get-tight-text-fit) ;; should be #t
