 I can't reproduce your error.  Can you be more specific about which 
 link labelled "Help Desk Home" you used?  Which browser are you using?

 Using IE 5.2.1, if I start DrScheme, select Help from the menu, it starts
 IE, and displays the help-desk page fine with frames fine, if I then select
 "Help Desk home" from within the top most frame, I get "Sending request for:
 servlets/main.ss" displayed at the bottom of the browser while things hang
 for a while, until the request is apparently serviced, then displays the
 Help-desk page again.
 
 It almost feels like its sending the request across the network for some
 reason, all other links work quickly and fine.

 Urgh; I'm updating to v5.2.1 of IE right now.  BTW, what's the 
 difference between 5.2 & 5.2.1?
 
 Paul(s), any ideas?

 What URL does the "Help Desk home" link refer to?
 
 In the current CVS code, it's "/servlets/home.ss".  It used to be
 "/servlets/main.ss".

 I updated mid this morning, and though I had done a setup-plt -c to clean
 things out prior to runing setup-plt to re-build everything again (which is
 actually a pain, like the older way beter, where -c ment clean and rebuild).
 
 I'll update again to make sure I didn't catch things while in the midst of
 being updated.

 I re-updated & re-built, and same basic thing happens,
 
 "/servlets/home.ss" is initially loaded which seems to draw the top frame,
 then after tries to load "/servlets/main.ss", and gets stuck for a little
 while (now about only 15 seconds or so) while apparently waiting for it's
 response to draw load the main frames description. (when selecting "Help
 Desk home" selection in the top help desk frame on the upper right).

 If you have frames disabled, is the behavior different?

 That suggests to me that there's a problem with frame support in the OS
 X version of IE.  The HTML code for the frames and no-frames version is
 identical, modulo the FRAMESET.  On other platforms, we don't see the
 problem.  
 
 We've also noticed a problem with incremental output in IE on OS X, that
 we don't see on other platforms.
 
 Maybe you can try Mozilla on OS X?

 I would note that until recently (possibly post my update to 10.2), help
 desk frames worked fine.

 If helpful, the same delayed response also occurs when the "take a tour" or
 "release notes" selections are made in the "about DrScheme" window, which
 seem to have nothing to do with frames?

 Nor does "refresh all manuals" work any longer, which used to work with IE
 5.2.1.

 Another clue hopefully; when IE hangs, if I bring DrScheme to front, about
 1/2 the time IE updates the remaining of the page fine, other times both
 DrScheme and IE are hung.

 Wait, wait, wait.  Your message suggests that you're not using IE 
 5.2.1 anymore.  I can't keep up!
 
 It sounds like your problems may be related to OS 10.2.  I haven't 
 installed it yet, because I'm concerned about conflicts.  Matthew may 
 be able to offer some input.  In fact, I'm not quite sure why he 
 hasn't been cc:'ed on all of these messages.

 Still using IE, just stating that I know "refresh all manuals" used to work
 with IE 5.2.1, and OSX 10.1.5, but since running OSX 10.2 with IE 5.2.1, I
 can't swear that I ever tried it until now, which doesn't work.

 Yes, I see that. For me, IE gets stuck until I do something in the
 DrScheme process. The same bug shows up in SirMail, where it sometmies
 gets stuck waiting for a response from the IMAP server.
 
 As far as I can tell, Apple broke WakeUpProcess() in 10.2, so DrScheme
 doesn't continue when a TCP port has ready data. This function hasn't
 been broken since 7.1.2 according to the FAQ, so I can see how Apple
 might forget.
 
 I guess the solution is to create a "notification" socket with the
 CFSocket routines, and attach that to the event queue. Then, the
 select()-running thread can notify the main one by writing to the
 socket, instead of using WakeUpProcess().
 
 Naturally, I can't find any useful documentation on CFSocket at Apple's
 web site, BUT they accidentally put a reference to "CFSocket.h" in the
 10.2 release notes. So, by merely by searching for "CFSocket" at the
 developer site and carefully combing through the resulting 7 hits, I
 can find out where to get more information. Hopefully, Apple will
 correct this gaping hole in their efforts to prevent useful
 documentation from escaping. (The folks in the Navigation Services
 department should be quite helpful, as they've developed a particularly
 effective mix of non-information and mis-information for their own
 documentation.)

 You've missed my favorite trick of all. For protocols like Apple 
 Events, Apple designs and documents in minute detail every aspect of 
 a magnificently general framework (or perhaps even a framework for
 developing a framework), and then entirely omits any documentation 
 whatsoever on the relevant implementations of said protocol by other 
 portions of the operating system (cf. 
 _Interapplication_Communication_).
 
 This is supplemented in certain situations by references to 
 apparently mythical repositories of concise and useful references. 
 "Apple Event Registry," anyone?  Even a central list of the meanings 
 of all the old error numbers was incredibly elusive; clearly the few 
 exceptions were compiled in the dead of night by rogue Apple staff 
 risking their jobs to
 compile this information.
