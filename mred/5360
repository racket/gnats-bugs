>Description:
I just installed DrScheme on my Macintosh Powerbook running OS9.0.4 with 320MB RAM.  For some reason, it crashes extremely easily: for example, after typing some code in the interpreter and then trying to use the menu to change the language level.  Or, running MzScheme/DrSchemeJr first and then trying to run DrScheme.

is this a known bug?  All I did was download the package and then run the setup program.

thank you.

 First off, do you have more than 128 fonts in your system?  I believe 
 there is a known problem with version 103 and such configurations.
 
 If not, I'd be interested in trying to reproduce your problem, but 
 I'd like you to be somewhat more specific.  For instance, from your 
 first example I infer the following series of steps; is this accurate?
 
 1) Double-click on DrScheme
 2) Type (+ 2 3) in the Definitions window.
 3) Click execute.
 4) Choose "Language:Choose Language"
 
 And then it crashes reproducibly?
 
 help me out,
 
 john clements

 Hello,
 
    Thank you for your quick reply.
    Yes, I did have more than 128 fonts.  I removed a bunch of them to the unused
 fonts directory, and DrScheme works fine now.
 
 thank you!
