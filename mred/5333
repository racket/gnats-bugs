I am a Debian GNU/Linux user, running the latest 'testing' distribution (updated this morning).  When I run 'drscheme' it starts up and puts me into the interactive window just fine, but there's no text in sight.  Where the File menu should be is only grayness, and the help windows and dialogues, buttons, etc - none of them have any visible text.

This happens both in the Debian packaged drscheme, and with the DrScheme that I've compiled from the source available from your site.

 I run DrScheme (200alpha15) under debian at home.  Perhaps you have a font
 problem?  Try 
  - starting DrScheme
  - typing Meta ;
    to pop up a preferences dialog
  - click on the button in the upper right corner
    (that should be labeled "Set Font" unless your fonts aren't working :-)
 
 Let us know if that fixes/works-around the problem.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul

 DrScheme is trying to use a "lucida" font for GUI items. (Normally,
 that's "-b&h-lucida-...".) I guess you don't have that font?
 
 This is the first time someone's reported a problem, so I had gotten
 used to thinking that Lucida is a standard font. Maybe we need to pick
 a different one?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
