>Description:
I'm trying to do mred graphical system development using
GNU emacs and want to run mred as my subordinate scheme
process.  I've checked the documentation, and it seems
there should be a way, but it doesn't seem to work.

On NT 4.0, both under the command shell and from in Emacs
attempts to use the documented flags for this purpose
don't work.  I still get the mred window popping up.
When I tried -ve "(read-eval-print-loop)" I got a version
message (I'm using v 103) and then [Exited].

Am I doing something wrong?  Also, what happened to the
-z and --stdio flags?

Thanks

 The -z and --stdio flags have been implemented for Windows for the next
 release, but not quite the way you want them; they still open a new
 stdio window.
 
 The problem is that MrEd is a Windows GUI application, but you really
 want a Windows console application. A command-line flag can't solve the
 problem, because GUIness or consoleness is a property of the .exe file.
 
 The solution, I think, is to have a MrEd console application, in
 addition to the normal MrEd GUI application. We're planning to move the
 towards MzScheme and MrEd DLLs, which should make implementing a MrEd
 console application easy for the next release.
