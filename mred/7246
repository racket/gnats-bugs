 Of course, I do know about that, and I decided to do it that way partly
 because <menukey>-w has been close window since about the dawn of time,
 but also because Safari has different behavior for the <menukey>-w menu
 item and the close box, which seemed strange.
 
 <menu-key>-minus closes just one tab.
 
 Still, I've run into this myself and am thinking that Safari's way of
 doing things is best.
 
 Does anyone know how other tab-based programs handle this, besides
 Safari?

 Galeon does the same thing, and goes even further to warn you if you
 try to close a window through the window manager when it has more than
 one tab.

 In almost any other application I tried, C-w is associated with
 documents (usually files), not with windows or tabs.  It looks like it
 just happens that in tab-less applications there's a 1:1 matching
 between windows and documents.  (But there are still things like
 acroread where there are no tabs but seperate windows for each
 document and even there C-w closes just the document.)

 I don't understand the parenthesized comment. What gui item holds a
 document, if not a tab or a window?

 Matthew, I seem to have found a bug in the menu code that causes menu
 attempt to fix this bug to break. I'm going to move the PR to you, but
 in the meantime, the example code is below. Run it, and hit cmd-w. This
 causes a printout. Then click the button. Now type cmd-w and you should
 see a printout, but you don't. Looking at the menus, however, it seems
 like there should be, since the cmd-w shortcut is attached to a menu
 item.

 A single window that contains several documents, and you use a menu to
 switch between them (no tabs).  So there is a single window and
 multiple documents, and C-w closes a document rather than the window.

 How does a window hold multiple documents? Is this an MDI window (with
 little windows inside a big window)?

 Sort of like an MDI window with all subwindows fixed at a maximized
 state.  So you can only switch different sub-windows, and they never
 exist with their own "window".
 
 (You can try it, I think Adobe has a uniform GUI on all platforms
 AFAIK.)

 <menukey>-w closes just one tab in mozilla.
 
 If it were me I would actually get rid of the "open file in new tab,
 not new window" and "re-use existing window when opening a
 file" preferences and make opening files independent from creating new
 tabs or new windows.  I.e. have the following five menus:
 
 - open file in current tab (or window if there's only one tab in the
   current window) always replacing the existing content if any (<menukey>-o)
 - open new empty window (<menukey>-n)
 - open new empty tab in current window (<menukey>-t)
 - close current tab (<menukey>-w)
 - close current window (<menukey>-<shift>-w or <menukey>-w if there's
   only one tab in the current window, ala mozilla)
 
 Using these five menus I can easily create any combination of windows
 and tabs (e.g. in mozilla I usually keep related stuff in different
 tabs of the same window and unrelated stuff in different windows -
 that way I can move on my screen all related web pages at once) and
 easily decide which windows or tabs I want to be empty to write new
 code in them and which ones I want to use to edit existing files.
 
 That's basically what mozilla does and it's much more intuitive to use
 than trying to guess what the different combinations of new, open, and
 preferences are doing in the current setting.  Yes, it means that to
 open a file in a new window I'd have to first type <menukey>-w before
 typing <menukey>-o but I see that as a small price to pay for the
 flexibility it would give us (i.e. the ability to decide on the fly
 whether to open the file in a new tab or a new window or the current
 one) and the conceptual simplification in understanding what drscheme
 does.
 
 Then things like the module browser can simply have three options
 (like mozilla has when following a web link): left click which
 corresponds to "open file in current tab" (like simply following a
 link in your browser) and right click which opens a menu giving you
 the choice between "open in new window" and "open in new tab".
 
 As an example of current problems, I usually have the "open file in
 new tab, not new window" and the "re-use existing window when opening
 a file" preferences not selected, so opening a new file opens a new
 window.  Fine.  But sometimes I have several windows open and I just
 want to open an extra tab in a given window to have around some not
 very important but related file.  I can use the "new tab" menu but
 then all I get is a new empty tab in the current window and I can see
 no way to open an existing file in it (since the open menu will open a
 new window).
 
 Another thing that's strange in drscheme is the notion of "current
 window".  If I open several windows then check the "open file in new
 tab, not new window" preference then open a file, the new tab will not
 always show up in the window where the blinking text cursor was.
 
 I think that together those two preferences, the new and open menus,
 and the current combination of windows and tabs have so many ways to
 interact that it's impossible to always predict what's going to happen
 when opening the next file.  It works well for the basic cases, it
 works strangely if you try more complicated stuff (like my "new tab"
 example two paragraphs above) and if you start changing your
 preferences half way through using drscheme then good luck trying to
 predict what's going to happen...
 
 So, to summarize, I think the two preferences should go and the menus
 should correspond to simpler actions that will then be easy to combine
 to get whatever result the user wants.

 They are sure orthogonal features.
 
 But in addition to logic, there are also psychological constraints, 
 which are usually formed via experience. So making drscheme similar to 
 safari and firefox are probably good ideas.

 In this vein, I don't think that I can change the meaning of cmd-o in
 the way Philippe suggests. I did consider changing it so that cmd-o
 takes over the most recent untouched window (if any) or maybe just any
 untouched window. That would probably not disturb people and would get
 most of what he suggests.

 That's not the entire bug. Looks like that bug confused my
 simplification, tho! Here's another (very similar) program. It suffers
 from the same problem as the last, but with the new binary.
 
 In particular, after clicking the button, you can select the menu and
 it prints, but the shortcut doesn't work.

 (module m mzscheme
   (require (lib "class.ss")
            (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
   (define f (new frame% (label "")))
   (define mb (new menu-bar% (parent f)))
   (define m (new menu% (parent mb) (label "menu")))
   (define mi1 (new menu-item% 
                    (parent m)
                    (label "menu item 1")

                     (lambda x

 This time, the problem was that enabling an item did not cause its
 keybinding to be restored, particularly if the item didn't have a
 keybinding before it was disabled.
 
 This one is fixed, now --- new "collects/mred/private/wxmenu.ss".

 So, while we're on the topic, what do people think about the
 control-tab/control-shift-tab vs control-pageup/pagedown keybindings?
 In VS.NET, control-tab and control-shift-tab move between tabs.
 Everywhere else (well, some other places), control-tab and
 control-shift-tab move between editable areas in the visible window and
 control-pageup/pagedown move between tabs.
 
 Is VS.NET just an outlier, or is the one to emulate?

 Yes, using the most recent untouched tab / window would be nice.

 Okay, I've checked that in. Let me know if the constraints are too
 stringent. Currently, the tab is re-used if all of the following hold:
 
   - this window has the most recently created tab in it
   - the currently visible tab:
      - has nothing in the definitions window
      - has nothing in the interactions window
      - definitions have not been saved
      - definitions's modified flag isn't set
