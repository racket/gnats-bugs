None of the key commands listed in the Edit Menu work. Typing Apple-C produces a question mark, deleting the selected text. The same for all other commands in the same menu.

 Sorry for the delay in replying.
 
 This bug only affects international keyboards, so if you have the
 option of setting your keyboard to an American setting, you should be
 able to work around the bug.
 
 Also we've fixed this in our latest pre-releases (available at
 http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/ ). They are relatively stable, so
 might be a good choice for you, depending on your needs.
 
 Sorry I don't have anything better to offer you.
 
 Robby
