>Release:        unknown
>Environment:
	mred -x, drscheme -x, Windows NT
>Description:
	When the first expression I type into MrEd reports an error or
a value, the buffer is updaated stragely. I can see the error/value
first appear in plain text and then it't font and color change. I
can't this under X, presumably because the display is too slow.
Also, it doesn't seem to happen for subsequent interactions.

	The same thing happens in DrScheme. Clicking execute does *not*
cause the bad update to happen again, but creating a new interaction
frame does (in the new frame).

	(This bug should probably be considered more than a nuisance
because it may indicate that something more important is wrong.)

>How-To-Repeat:
	Run mred under Windows
	Type an expression into the REP that is an error
	 (error messages so the affect more clearly)
>Fix:

Actually it turns out that nothing more important is wrong. I had added
something so that the first bit of io is flushed immediately (so you don't
ever see an empty io box sitting there) but hadn't wrapped a
begin/edit-edit-sequence around it. So I put the begin/edit-edit-sequence
and things are fine.
