>Description:
PLT program failed to install several times, and upon success in installation, failed to open correctly (syntax-e: expects argument of type <syntax>; given #<eof>

[Exited]).

Files cannot be deleted for a clean installation. System states items could not be deleted because of ownership by root (?), even though I am logged in as administrator.

Errors may be involved with Mac OS 10.2.3 Jaguar (perhaps incompatible).
