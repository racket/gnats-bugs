>Description:
When I launch DrScheme, I got an error: 'Application initialization fails'.
When I launch Help Desk, I got the same error.
When I launch MrEd, I got the same error.
When I launch MzScheme, I got the same error for release 202 while release 201 works.

Can you tell me how can I have DrScheme work?

Thanks,
Kejun

 Can you provide a screen shot of the error dialog you get, as a JPEG or
 GIF file?  I haven't seen this error before, and I'm unable to find
 information about that message on the Web.
 
 One guess is that the .DLL files supplied with DrScheme are not being
 found.  In Windows 2000, you should see files named libmzsch202_000.dll,
 libmzgc202_000.dll, and libmred202_000.dll in the WINNT\System32\
 directory.  Are those files there?

 After doing a Web search on the error code, 0xc0000142, it looks like
 some .DLL is failing to load.  It could be one of the DrScheme .DLLs
 that I mentioned or, more likely, some system .DLL.
 
 On my system, here are the .DLLs that DrScheme v202 loads:
 
 	NTDLL.DLL
 	libmred202_000.dll
 	libmzsch202_000.dll
 	libmzgc202_000.dll
 	KERNEL32.DLL
 	USER32.DLL
 	GDI32.DLL
 	wsock32.dll
 	ws2_32.dll
 	msvcrt.dll
 	ADVAPI32.DLL
 	rpcrt4.dll
 	ws2help.dll
 	SHELL32.DLL
 	shlwapi.dll
 	comctl32.dll
 	OPENGL32.DLL
 	glu32.dll
 	ddraw.dll
 	dciman32.dll
 	winmm.dll
 	COMDLG32.DLL
 	OLE32.DLL
 	serwvdrv.dll
 	umdmxfrm.dll
 	IadHide3.dll
 
 It could be that one of these .DLLs is corrupt, or that your DrScheme
 installation file was corrupt.  
 
 If you can't find the problem, I'd suggest trying another machine.
 DrScheme v202 has been installed on literally thousands of Windows
 machines, and this is the first we've heard of this problem.

 Did you ever get this to work?
