>Description:
I opened DrScheme with an existing file. Then, from this open DrScheme, I
selected open, and created a new DrScheme window. However, the close command
under the file menu continued to be greyed out for the original file and window.
There was no way to close that window without quiting DrScheme.

 It should be fixed now.  
 
 If there's exactly one DrScheme frame, its File|Close menu item
 should be disabled.  Otherwise, that menu item should be
 available.
 
 Please try it.
