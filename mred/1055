>Description:
FreeBSD 3.0 (or something like that) switched to elf executible format. 

Also, when the source is compiled, some of the assembly labels are rejected.
After these are changed, and drscheme is compiled and run and closed, the 
following error messages are sent to the terminal:
mred in free(): warning: pointer to wrong page
or
mred in free(): warning: junk pointer, too high to make sense

The first occurs sometimes as many as 12 times, normally more.
The second occurs one or two times, sometimes more.


>How-To-Repeat:
I can't give more detailed information as I didn't try to install DrScheme
myself. My roommate installed it and was too lazy to submit a report. If 
more specific information would be good, I can try to find out.

 Ok. I think there's a FreeBSD 3.0 machine around here at Utah, so I'll
 try it out.

 It's libg++. The only solution I've ever found is to leave libg++ out
 of the link, but that's not a trivial task since g++ links it in by
 default.
 
 Thanks for the report,
