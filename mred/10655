>Description:
Eventhough Windows version of DrScheme can accept Japanese input, Linux version ignores input from IME such as Anthy.
>How-To-Repeat:
I use Ubuntu 9.04.
For example, Windows version of DrScheme can accept such definitions as:

(define (ほげ)
 (display "ほげ")
 (newline))

, mixed with Japanese letters in the difinition window; however, Linux version of DrScheme ignores Japanese input.
With UTF-8 environment, I think this is no good.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Mon, 13 May 2013 18:14:13 -0400
Reason>>> Works as expected in recent versions of Racket.
