>Description:
Visiting a Web page with an animated GIF yields an error to stdout:

  LoadGIF() - corrupt GIF file (screen descriptor)

If this is a problem with the animated GIF format (I don't know
that it is -- I'm just conjecturing), MrEd should
at least put a "broken animation" in its place, or otherwise
handle it more gracefully.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to the Help Desk | Scheme and PLT | TS! Workshops | link to
the workshop home page.  There is an animated GIF at the bottom
of that page.

 Thanks - I hadn't figured out what was triggering that error message.
 
 I've committed and exp-tagged a fix for X. It's not a problem in
 Windows or, presumably, MacOS. (I tried Windows, and the code there is
 derived [yuck!] from the MacOS implementation.)
