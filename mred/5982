>Description:
The Windows convention says that if an application has no open windows, it obviously isn't doing anything so it quits.  The Macintosh convention allows an application to have any number of open windows, including zero.  DrScheme seems to adhere to the former convention, even in the Macintosh version.  Was this a conscious decision?

This is a minor annoyance, but it IS an annoyance when I'm grading a whole lot of student assignments: I'd like to be able to close one student's assignment, then open the next student's assignment, without waiting for DrScheme to quit and restart.  The obvious workaround is to have an extra dummy window of my own, minimized, just to keep DrScheme alive....
>How-To-Repeat:
Open one or more windows in DrScheme.  Close each one, one at a time.  When you close the last one, it asks to confirm that you want to quit DrScheme (which I don't; I just want to close that window).
