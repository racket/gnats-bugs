 If you do see this, there are things that you can check that would help
 find out what the problem is (or if it is my problem or not :)
 
   - hide the application and re-show it -- do the words come back?
   - resize the window -- do the words come back?

 Yeap. I actually realized this but I was so happy I got it to do the
 right thing I plain forgot .. then I filed the bug report and quit.

 Lucky you. I can reproduce it with the drscheme that's open. 
 
 When I move DrScheme below the screen and bring it back, the text
 does NOT appear. When I bring up another app and then hide it, 
 the text in the hide-and-seek boxes appears. 
 
 That sounds like Matthew's problem, right? -- Matthias

 Welcome to DrScheme, version 202.5-cvs1nov2002.
 
 That's also when I compiled, I think.

 That's recent enough that my first guess is wrong.
 
 I know what could be going wrong, in theory. Hopefully I'll be able to
 produce the bug on my machine next week.
