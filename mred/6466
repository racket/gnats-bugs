>Description:
I can't seem to print images that are part of the definitions pane.

Help soon please!   I am trying to print the Comp210 exam that I am giving tomorrow morning!

Thanks,
Stephen Wong

>How-To-Repeat:
1.  Use Special/Insert Image to add an image to the definitions pane.
2. Print Definitions.
3.  Text prints fine with a blank space where the image should be.

 I suspect that this is a platform-specific (or printer-specific)
 problem -- if I'm right the fastest way for you to get your exam
 printed is probably to switch to linux of macos and print to pdf or ps
 and then transfer that to the printer. You may be also able to get some
 kind of print-preview path under windows to work as well (Is there a
 print to ps or pdf option in your print dialog?)
 
 Of course, we'll work on a real solution to this problem for the next
 release!

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 00:47:44 -0500
Reason: mred bug?  Maybe this is already solved?

View:
  http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/query/?cmd=view+audit-trail&pr=6466

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:07 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
