>Description:
what ever i have try i get always a fatal exception in DrScheme and in MzScheme. Neither the mxdemo.ss is working.
(i have try it in w2000 and XP with the same results)

The problem is that i cant instantiate the mx-browser%. Always getting a fatal error.

exception : 0xc00000fd at location 0x1000900c
--------------------------------------------------------------------
im using IE 6.0.2..  with SP1

The Com/Dcom interface is working ok.


>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx"))
(require (lib "class.ss"))

(define mxb (make-object mx-browser% ...))
; i havent declared anything else as it doesnt recognize anything else

Reason>>> 
Sorry for the delay in responding. I somehow overlooked
the bug report.

I believe this problem has been fixed in version 352, which is
the latest version. (More specifically, it was fixed in v350.)
If you can upgrade, please let us know if you still see problems.
Unfortunately, we don't have a solution other than upgrading.

Matthew
