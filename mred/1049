>Description:
When I iconify a drscheme window, the reuslting icon has the proper
mred icon black foreground, but instead of being on a plain background,
it has a garbage background.  Each time I create a new window, the
background for that window's icon is different (but consistent across
iconficiations of the same window).  My X window manager is fvwm.

run drscheme, iconify window
