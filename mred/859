A message% object on the mac that is initialized with the string "" will never display strings longer than that, even if it stretches, unlike Xt.

This is a simple window for evaluating MrEd Scheme expressions.
Quit now and run DrScheme to get a better window.
The current input port always returns eof.

;; here, under Xt, resizing the frame would make FFFF legible.

 Actually, if you resize the frame under Xt, it has the same truncating
 behavior as MacOS. But if the frame starts out larger than the
 message, then Xt shows the larger string (without re-centering the
 message, if it was centered before). Xt shouldn't show the larger
 string; I fixed it for the next release.
 
 Note that if you make the message item stretchable, it stretches on
 all platforms.

 Aha! They aren't stretchable by default. Of course. Thanks for finding
 the problem there.
