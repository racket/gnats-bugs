>Description:

When get-file-list is used to select a file deeper
than the root directory, it does not append the
directory separator on the last subdirectory before th
file name.
E.g.:

Correct -
> (get-file-list)
("H:\\i810-agpgart-module.tar.gz" "H:\\emacs.sh")

Incorrect -
> (get-file-list)
("H:\\codeHTTPParser.java" "H:\\codeexclude.java")

There should be a \\ between code and the Java file

Only appears when selecting more than one file.
>How-To-Repeat:


Select two or more files from a directory deeper than
the root.  Return values will be incorrect
