>Description:
Under WindowsXP SP1a,
      12pt Courier New
      any font smoothing selection
typing text in the definitions pane "jitters"
up and down a couple of pixels until a space is
entered.  Then the line stabilizes.

Other applications don't exhibit this
behaviour, nor does the 13pt Courier New font.
The appearance is quite irritating.

 I've diagnosed the problem further.  It appears to be related to
 bold/nonbold font changes with Courier New 12pt.  For example, make
 parentheses be syntax colored as bold, and enter ( and all is well, follow
 up with a d (now showing (d, and notice small jitter in displayed 2
 characters.
 
 To make all text show the problem, make all syntax categories be bold.
 Then start entering ... line of text moves up and down until a space, then
 entire line stays put.

 It seems to be a problem of Courier New 12pt bold: looks like space is
 a little higher than other characters, as can be seen by typing some
 text at this font, then using shift+arrows, you can see that the
 selection grows a bit taller when including the space.
