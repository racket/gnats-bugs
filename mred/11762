>Description:
When in Debug mode when the mouse cursor is over the step button when I click it steps as expected but if I click again the Step button appears to change its appearance (perhaps it's comunicating it's selected) but the button is not pressed and a step doesn't occure.  If I mouse the cursor off of the step button then back onto it I can click it for one more step.  I have to repeate moving the cursor of of the step button and back onto it for each step.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go into debug and run some code, mouse to the step button and start clicking.  You'll only get the one step until you remove the cursor from the button.
>Fix:
