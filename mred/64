>Description:
Say you go to the PLT home page (using the MrEd Web browser).  Click
on the plt-bugs mailto: URL.  You get a box saying "Scheme mailto
unsupported".  (This box has the title "Malformed URL", which is an
incorrect title ...)  Click on OK.  You get a message-box that reads
`Unable to find destination position "mailto:plt-bugs@cs.rice.edu"
Scheme mailto unsupported' [sic].  This shouldn't appear.
