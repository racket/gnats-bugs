Responsible-Changed-From-To: krentel->robby
Responsible-Changed-By: robby
Responsible-Changed-When: Tue May  6 17:00:17 1997
Responsible-Changed-Why:

save as does save-file, so after-save-file also needs to update the locked
status of the buffer, not just after-load-file.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Tue May  6 18:32:44 1997
