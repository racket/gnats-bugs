>Description:
After DrScheme has been in the background for an indeterminate amount of time (seems like usually ~30s), it [the DrScheme process] starts spinning at 70% or more CPU. If I switch back to DrScheme, it drops down to the normal almost-nothing baseline.

This happens both when a DrScheme proper window is frontmost in the process or when the "Bug Report Form" window is frontmost. :-)

See http://jesnetplus.com/~jsailor/temp/1264051341-Sample%20of%20DrScheme.txt
 for a sample of the C stack, if it helps.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is repeatable in my current instance of DrScheme. I'm not sure if it'll survive a DrScheme restart; if you can't replicate it, though, my instance will probably still be running for a while.

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:53 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
