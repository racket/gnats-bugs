>Description:
their startup windows are not made frontmost window; apparently
resulting in the application being deprioritorized for CPU time,
significantly slowing startup execution. (which shouldn't be the
case for OSX apps in general?)

>How-To-Repeat:
start up applicaion, monotor startup performance, select window,
notice difference in performance.

 My comments: Yep, this occurs because the launcher starts the 
 applications with an exec(), rather than a message to the Finder. 
 There's probably a way to make the new application move to the front. 
 W.R.T. the larger question: yes, the application should behave the 
 same way when it's in the background.  My recollection is that it 
 still doesn't, and that this is because we're still more or less 
 polling for keystrokes.  I believe this could be solved either by 
 finishing the rewrite of the event loop to use Carbon stuff or by 
 finding the problem with WaitNextEvent and its mask.

 Not being a competent Mac OS/X "C" programmer myself, I don't have a strong
 opinion; but from the best I can tell, it would seem that integrating the
 refinements required to "Carbonize" wxmac, mzscheme, etc. would allow both
 the Mac OS, and OSX birds to be killed with one stone?

 Yes, you're essentially right; if we spent the time to carbonize the 
 event loop, these changes could potentially be used in a Carbon 
 version of the classic application as well.  However, producing a 
 carbon version of MzScheme would be very hard, because we'd have to 
 figure out what to do about all of the TCP/IP code; currently, we 
 have Classic TCP/IP code (not easily carbonizable) and UNIX-style 
 TCP/IP code (used in the OS X version and all other UNIX flavors).  I 
 don't see how to bridge this gap, aside from writing a lot more code.

 with the OSX 10.1.3 update, the window now is brought to front, but
 execution performance still degrades dramatically if not remaining the
 front-most window.

 Really? I'll have to try that.  As I mentioned before, though, I'm 
 not at all surprised that the performance is dreadful when not in 
 front; this has to do with the way that MrEd polls for events (-ish) 
 when  in the foreground, and the corresponding desire not to take up 
 huge amounts of CPU while in the background.
 
 In other words, the event loop needs a rewrite.
 
 While I'm on the topic, the real problem here is that MrEd does all 
 kinds of funny sorting on the Event queue; it's really hard to 
 simulate its current behavior without copying all  of the events out 
 of the main queue and into a queue of mrEd's own.  Which is what it 
 now does.
