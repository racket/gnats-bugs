>Description:
On the mac, clicking once on the scroll bar above the current thumb
location causes the target area to scroll upward by one page. 
However, if I click and hold in that area, the thumb pops back to
the bottom when it reaches the top, so I observe a rapid 
"zip-zip-zip" of the thumb scrolling up and then wrapping to the 
bottom again ad infinitum.

Oh, right; I've only observed this in a list box
>How-To-Repeat:
This seems to be easier to reproduce with a longer list; I noticed
it with Robby's *extremely* long list, but reproduced it with one
of length ~30 by resizing the list box to be small.  In smaller 
cases, it seems to be more sensitive to mouse placement.
