 Just to make sure: you are running the binary released saturday,
 right? (I.e., either you're running out of ~mflatt/plt or you've
 bundled since Saturday evening.)
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I did not bundle _after_ I sent the first series of error messages on
 Saturday afternoon. Does that mean I have an old version? -- Matthias

 Yes. You can tell that you have an old version when:
 
  * You submit a bug report, then
 
  * I refer to your bug report in a release message, then
 
  * You get the same bug again without downloading a new version.
 
 In this case, it is not strictly necessary to resubmit the bug
 report. :)
