 If you're running Windows XP, this is a known problem. 
 
 We hope to fix this for the next release, due out soon.

 I'm running the same platform here, with no problems.
 
 See if you can answer these:
 
  - What are the exact symptoms?
  - What directory is the program installed in?
  - How much disk space is available in that directory?

 All I can suggest is running
 
 	"Setup PLT.exe" -c
 
 at the command line in your PLT directory, and trying to run DrScheme
 again.
 
 You can also download v200alpha1 of DrScheme at
 
     http://download.plt-scheme.org/
 
 if you're adventurous.

 Hi,

 Did you ever get this to work?
 
 If you want to try an experimental version of DrScheme, which is
 actually very stable, you might want to look at the v200alpha12 version
 at http://download.plt-scheme.org/.

 Another thing to try is to use Windows `Search' facility to look for
 files named `mred.ini' and `mred.pre'.  Delete those files, and restart
 DrScheme.
 
 Please let me know if this works.
