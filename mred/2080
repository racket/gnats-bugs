Mac PowerPC
>Description:
Soon after I launch Dr Scheme, the computer freezes (even if I am merely opening the Help Desk) and I need to do a force quit to get out of it.  I have allocated 2 MB to DrScheme (recommended is listed as 200K) and 48MB to MrEd (recommended is 32MB).  This happens even if it is the only application running.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Launch Dr. Scheme, open saved file of definitions (maybe 20 lines long at most), try to edit file

2) Launch Dr Scheme, open help pages (Help Desk), try to move off of first page

 I'm not quite sure what to tell you.  First, increasing the memory 
 allocation to DrScheme is unnecessary; DrScheme is a tiny shell 
 program which quits as soon as it's started MrEd.
 
 Second, I'm wondering if you can provide slightly more detailed 
 instructions on how to crash it: your second example is pretty 
 straightforward, but when you write "move off of first page" you mean 
 that you're clicking on one of the page's links?  Can you tell me 
 which one?
 
 Also, you might try starting with extensions turned off, to see if 
 it's some kind of extension conflict.
 
 Finally: what version of the Mac OS are you using?
 
 The bottom line is this:  if I can't reproduce your error, I probably 
 can't help you.  I just downloaded this package myself, and I was 
 unable to crash it.  If you can think of any more details that might 
 help me, please let me know.
