>Description:
By possibly implementing one-of and/or both:
- binding a user-env with no-open files to an invisable "null-window" to support
   the display of default menues, without requuireing a visable window on the mac.
- adding an Replace... file menue item, which will conditionally save the
   presetly active defintion view, and then open the new selected definition
   file in that window's defintion view.
  adding a Reinitialize file menue item which conditionally save the presently
   active defintion view, and then clear the definition view to be empty, and
   re-initalizes that window's env.

(the later sugestions should be useful to all platforms)
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
I've fixed the 3rd bullet in the original PR submission
by adding an ellipses to the "New" menu item
and prompting the user about it, when it "open here..."
mode.

There were no contract violations -- this was merely
additional functionality.

 Alternatively one could:
 - support the use of a menu modifier key (such as "option") to enable
   either open file in-new-env-win, or replacing-present-env-win semantics.
 AND
 - add new-env-window menu item to open a new definition/interaction window.
 - add re-initialize menu item to re-initialize the presently active window.

Reason>>> Robby made related changes long ago, I think.

Adding support for Option- menu shortcuts is another PR.
