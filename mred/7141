>Description:
On Windows, I find that when I switch between applications, such as Firefox and Dr Scheme. That Dr. Scheme is quite unresponsive for a couple of minutes.  Maybe this is due to the large memory size of the program and the amount of memory management required to switch.   However this makes the program nearly unusable because I spend about half the time waiting for DrScheme to let me type or refresh itself.  I realize this is a very general bug report, but I don't have an idea what is the cause.   I find the IDE interface very intuitive, but overall the program is not useable.  I would love to provide more information if that would be useful.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Sat, 22 Jan 2005 05:20:54 -0500
Reason>>> mred (probably nothing to do)


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:37:43 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
