>Description:
For MrEd classes which are the result of mixin applications,
such as frame:searchable%, the documentation doesn't specify the 
class' initialization arguments.  One has to follow a lot of pointers to 
get this information.  It would be handy to have that information
with the class.

 That is a good idea.
 
 Unfortuantely, it requires a fair amount of work on some very bad code
 (not that any one piece of the code is bad, but the overall structure
 of the documentation implementation is bad) so I don't think that I
 will do it very soon. Hopefully I will have time before 100 goes out.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

This requires a change to simpleparse (and maybe to the specs for @mixin)
and could be difficult, but I agree it is useful. Probably won't be done
for 100alpha2.
