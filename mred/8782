>Description:
I recently moved from a Mac PowerBook(PPC) to a MacBook(dual Intel).  I am running MacOSX(Tiger vers. 10.4.9). I just installed DrScheme version 370 for MacOSX Intel. When I tried to adjust my editing preferences to "Treat option key as meta", I was unsuccessful.  I tried checking the check-box "Treat option key as meta" and it changed the behavior of option (from the Greek option keys to simple characters, eg. option-b formerly gave an integral-sign, but now just types a b, but does not do the meta-b action of backing up a word).  I got this to work fine when using Dr. Scheme on my PowerBook(PPC), with DrScheme v.301, but on my MacBook it fails me.  Am I missing something.  Oh yes, fyi (not sure if it's relevant) I tried checking and un-checking the "enable keybindings in menus" box [these are all in the Preferences "Editing", then under "General".  I'm not sure what that does, but my brother suggested trying it un-clicked. No effect either way, unfortunately.  Help, please!
 ! I find it virtually unusable to have to type "Esc" as a prefix to get Meta-key functionality.  Thanks in advance!
>How-To-Repeat:
Download and install DrScheme v.370 for MacOSX(Intel).
Start DrScheme
Go to DrScheme>Preferences
Select "Editing" and then "General"
Check the check-box "Treat option key as meta"
Enter some text words in the editor or interactor pane
Try doing meta-b (to move back a word).
Instead of moving back, it simply prints a "b" character.
It still requires an "Esc" prefix to get the desired effect.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 06 Jul 2007 22:49:35 -0400
Reason>>> drscheme, or maybe mred


Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Fri, 06 Jul 2007 23:37:48 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew said he would add something to support this, I believe.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 25 Jul 2007 14:50:32 -0400
Reason>>> Added "Use Command as Meta" support (whcih actually works)
for the next version; now available as a nightly build or from
SVN
