 Judging from the source code, the window should be resizable. It
 certainly is for me, under mac os x. (Matthew: it is a dialog% that
 has the style '(resize-border); line 468 of
 drscheme/private/frame.ss).
 
 As it turns out there is a preference for the size of that window. The
 preference is, ordinarily, only set when you resize the window, but if
 you quit drscheme and then edit the preferences file you can probably
 work around the problem for now. You should see a line that looks like
 this:
 
  (plt:framework-pref:drscheme:keybindings-window-size (200 . 400))
 
 The two numbers are the width and height of the window. Change them,
 save the file, and start up DrScheme.
 
 Let us know if that works!

 Yes, the workaround works nicely. Also, I doublechecked and the window
 is definitely not resizable on my ubuntu system. I grepped through the
 code to see where else resize-border was used, and it works for
 multi-file-search but not for language-configuration.

 I believe the multi-file search is a frame% object, not a dialog%
 object. Probably that's the difference.
