>Description:
	Instances of mred:pastboard-frame% are not automatically shown
on creation when 0 initialization arguments are provided. This turns
out to be consistent with the old manual, but inconsistent with
previous releases. The new manual shows that the startup arguments for
mred:pastboard-frame% have be changed, but there's no mention of these
changes in mred/system/history.
	The old and new manuals are both incorrect with for
mred:editor-frame%, which *is* shown by default, as in previous
releases, but the manual says that it is not shown.
