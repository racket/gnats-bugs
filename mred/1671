>Description:
The bundling instructions I sent out for mac bundling 
were wrong, I believe.

I downloaded the bundle and started it up. 
On my machine is a plt installation in
"Cupertino:Desktop Folder:103 bundling:ppc:plt" (or something similar).
This is the directory that I created the bundles in.

When I downloaded the fresh 103 from the web page and started it up,
all of the launchers were pointing into that directory.
This should not have happened.

 This is not (really) a problem. It's true that when you run Setup 
 PLT, the GoMz and GoMr template launchers are linked to the existing 
 executables.  However, this will not be a problem for users who do 
 not have a path by that name.  The correct solution, I believe, is to 
 amend the installation process so that
 a) setup PLT is always run
 b) launchers are replaced when this happens

 What if a user has a path like that? Is there's some tag file or 
 something that the bundler can throw away to make gomz and gomr 
 re-link themselves?
