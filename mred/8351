>Description:
On my German keyboard, Ctl-\ and Ctl-' don't work.
The former requires three keys to type and just inserts
a \, the second one can be either typed with two or
three keys; neither works.

Also, say, Alt-< doesn't work as expected: Rather
than going to the end of the editor, it inserts
the single-character version for <=.  (This may be
intended, as that's what it does in ordinary
Mac OS X text input.)

Four-key combinations such as Alt-Ctl-; (; is 
shifted) don't work either: It's as if no modifier
was pressed.

(The ordinary German script characters work.)

Cheers,
Mike

 I see the the problem with Cmd-\. Typing \requires pressing Opt, right?
 But to support Cmd-Opt- menu combinations, MrEd produces an a Cmd-Opt-ß
 event.
 
 I can imagine handling this by treating Opt more like Shift, so that
 MrEd notes that \ is an alternate interpretation for ß (and that it's a
 more precise interpretation). I'm not sure where it all ends, but I
 think I'll have to go a few steps beyond the current mechanisms.
 
 Meanwhile, I don't see why Cmd-' fails. What are the two ways to type it?

 Yes, I think we have to declare that to be the intended behavior.
 Option-< doesn't work with a U.S. keyboard, either. (It does work in
 SirMail, because we've thrown in a `(special-option-key #t)'. But on a
 German keyboard, I think that would make \ completely inaccessible.)

 Do you mean that ; is inserted? Or that the Ctl is effectively ignored,
 and the character produced by Opt-Shift-. is inserted?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I'm not sure what a "Cmd-Opt-ß" event is.  \ is on Shift-Alt-7.  ß is
 on a different key.  (Maybe you're assuming PC keyboard layout, where
 \ is on the ß key.  On Macs, it isn't.)
 
 > Meanwhile, I don't see why Cmd-' fails. What are the two ways to type it?
 
 Either by typing Shift-#, or by typing the key labelled with ' and `.
 (In most but not all applications, the former produces the ' directly,
 whereas the second acts as a modifier.)

 No, a , is inserted: even the Shift is ignored.

 Right --- I was looking at PC keyboard layouts (which was the only
 thing I managed to find this morning).
 
 Thanks for all the clarifications.

 The important thing is the Option/Alt part. This will work in v352.9.

 This one still puzzles me. I works on my machine (both old version and
 new) when I switch my keyboard to German (so that the key labeled "\"
 becomes "#"). But I don't know whether that's the same as using a real
 German keyboard.

 I can't figure out this one, either. Cmd- used to drop some modifiers
 (I've changed that in 352.9), but not Option/Alt.
 
 In any case, I hope that v352.9 is a little better.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
 


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:53 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
