>Description:
	set-curosr doesn't seem to work as advertised.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install this code:

(define f (make-object wx:frame% null "" 100 100 200 200))
(define p (make-object wx:panel% f))
(define c (make-object wx:media-canvas% p))
(define e (make-object wx:media-edit%))
(send c set-media e)

(send f show #t)
(wx:begin-busy-cursor)

(define se (make-object wx:media-edit%))
(define s (make-object wx:media-snip% se))
(send se insert "test test")
(send e insert "test test")
(send e insert #\newline)
(send e insert s)
(send e insert #\newline)
(send e insert "test test")
(send e insert #\newline)
(send se set-cursor (make-object wx:cursor% wx:const-cursor-ibeam) #f)
(send c set-size 0 0 200 200)
(send p set-size 0 0 200 200)


(define (mred:initialize . x)
  (thread (lambda ()
	    (read-eval-print-loop)
	    (newline)
	    (exit))))

the cursor stays a watch cursor. If you switch the order of the show frame
and set watch cursor, the cursor stays an ibeam cursor {I may have the
sense of the switch backwards. Apologies, if so}

State-Changed-When: Mon Mar 16 10:35:22 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The main problem is that begin-busy-cursor overrides eveything. There
is a bug, however, that frames opened after a begin-busy-cursor (and
before the end) don't get the busy cursor.
