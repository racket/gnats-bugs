Hi,

1) DrScheme does not start on a Power Mac 4400/200 under system 7.6.1 
(storage is 49 MB).

2)in the DrScheme article you describe the use of the Stepper (Fig. 6). 
I could not find it in the loaded version. What to do?

             Bye Claus
>How-To-Repeat:
1) I click on the start icon "lambda"
2) The DrScheme logo with the horizontal bar appears
2) DrScheme is loading; the horizontal bar is moving to the right
3) The DrScheme logo is disappearing

I expect that you're seeing a MacOS bug in DrScheme that is fixed for
version 53 (to be released in a couple of weeks). We didn't find this
bug for 52 because it's intermittent -- sometimes DrScheme works
anyway.

The stepper no longer works due to backward-incompatible changes to
our GUI engine, and the stepper's maintainer has left our
group. Meanwhile, the stepper is being re-written from scratch, but
progress is slow. At least the new one will be maintainable when it is
ready.
