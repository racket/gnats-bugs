In version 47 and before, when you opened a file in subdirectory foo,
then pulled up the dialog to open another file, it automatically displayed
subdirectory foo again. I found this very convenient. Now, the dialog
always defaults to the directory from which you ran DrScheme.

 Oops -- we should be cc'ing plt-gnats on these kinds of emails...

 I'm double-clicking on each component of the directory name. Are you sure
 we're talking about the same version? My dialog box has the little window
 for typing at the top. Anyway, I'll show you when you come in.

 Check you preferences -- probably you are using the platform-specific
 dialogs (which under X, suck).
