>Description:
This was tested with Racket 5.0.99.4--2010-12-02(170905d/a), but since the bug reporting tool that comes with that build is broken, I'm submitting this using the bug-report tool from Racket 5.0.2.

The GUI library that comes with Racket produces an undesireable flickering effect when running a simple clock program, implemented by updating the label of a message% object, letting Racket's GUI library handle the actual graphics.

"samth" on #racket couldn't see the problem on a Linux build of Racket 5.0.99, so the problem may only effect the Windows XP version.

This problem was encountered on a Dell Latitude D610 laptop, which comes with a Mobile Intel 910GM graphics chipset. It has 1GB of RAM (memory speed unknown), and a 1.86 GHz single-core processor (cache size unknown).

The flickering is more pronounced if I move the program's window over to the second monitor.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program in GRacket or DrRacket:

#lang racket/gui
(require (planet jphelps/guiml))
(require srfi/13)

(define (the-time)
  (define date (seconds->date (current-seconds)))
  (define (convert n)
    (string-pad (number->string n) 2 #\0))
  (format "~a:~a:~a" (convert (date-hour date))
          (convert (date-minute date))
          (convert (date-second date))))
          

(define clock (guiml (frame% (@ (label "Clock")
                                (width 350)
                                (height 200))
                             (message% 'time (@ (label (the-time)) (auto-resize #f)
                                                (font (make-object font% 100 'system
                                                        'normal 'bold)))))))

(sendmsg clock show #t)

(thread
 (Î» ()
   (do () (#f #f)
     (sleep 1)
     ;; This call to message% method set-label results in flicker.
     (sendmsg (get-widget-by-id clock 'time) set-label (the-time)))))
