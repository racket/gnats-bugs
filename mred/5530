Compiled from source (RPM and tar-ball)
compilation seems to run ok, but
install script gives an error when running setup-plt (segfault)
and drscheme segfaults !

>How-To-Repeat:
ton@midgaard:~/packages/plt> ./install
setting PLTHOME to /home/ton/packages/plt in scripts:
 updating bin/archsys
 updating bin/drscheme
 updating bin/drscheme-jr
 updating bin/help-desk
 updating bin/mred
 updating bin/mzc
 updating bin/mzscheme
 updating bin/setup-plt
PLT software starts up much faster with .zo files, but creating .zo
files now takes a few minutes and requires about 5MB of additional
disk space. Create .zo files later by running plt/bin/setup-plt.
 Create .zo files now (y/n)? [y] 
./install: line 151: 10399 Segmentation fault      bin/setup-plt

PLT installation done.
Run DrScheme as bin/drscheme.
For Help, select `Help Desk' from DrScheme's `Help' menu, or run bin/help-desk.

 You probably want to use the just-released version 200 instead.  See
 
   http://download.plt-scheme.org/
 
 Do you get a segfault with that version?

 Torsten,

 That page is superseded.  I suppose we should have it do a redirect.

 There was a routing problem at the University of Utah, where that host
 is located.  You should be able to connect now.
