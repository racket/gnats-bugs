>Description:
Currently, drscheme uses the result of the save-file method
to determine if there was an error saving the file. If the
result of the method is #f, drscheme puts up a dialog
saying "error saving file".

This doesn't work, however, because the
method returns the same result in two cases that
drscheme would like to distinguish:

1) saving a bad filename (missing directory, 
   cannot overwrite a file, etc)

2) user cancels the dialog when prompted to
   choose a filename 

(note, it is not enough for drscheme to check the value
of get-filename before issuing the save-file, since
the get-file dialog can probably return filenames that
are illegal and should result in errors (which would be
the first case not the second))
>How-To-Repeat:
;; this code:
(define t (make-object text%))
(send t save-file) ;; click cancel in dialog
;; returns #f

;; this code:
(define t (make-object text%))
(send t set-filename "/baddir/doesnotexist")
(send t save-file)
;; also returns #f

;; would like these two be differet somehow
