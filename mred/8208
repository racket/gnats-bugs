>Description:
The scroll-to method of the editor-admin% class does not respect the editor's set-scroll-step for horizontal scrolling (vertical scrolling does; horizontal scrolling has an apparent fixed step of 8); it also does not scroll horizontally if the selected region does not fit the horizontal width (vertical scrolling correctly fits part of the region in, according to the provided bias).

It seems clear from the documentation that failing to scroll to fit at least part of the region in is a bug.  The scroll-step issue is less clear, but from a practical standpoint horizontal scrolling should either respect the scroll-step or have a separate step for horizontal scrolling.

Also, both dimensions of scrolling are "jerky" when the scroll-step is above 1: certain coordinates, provided repeatedly without change, can cause scrolling back and forth between two positions rather than staying put.
