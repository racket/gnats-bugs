>Release:        200alpha15
>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
On a machine with the following software installed: 

Mac OSX 10.1.3
Fink 0.9.9a
Xfree86 4.2.0-4
fvwm 2.4.6
XDarwin 1.0.6
Blackbox 0.61.1


When I build DrScheme so that it will run under X11 the application
builds successfully. But when I run the application with FVWM as my
window manager the DrScheme and MrEd windows refuse to take on focus.
Making it impossible to type text into DrScheme. If I switch my window 
manager to Blackbox, or when if I do not have a window manager running 
the application takes on Focus and functions properly.

This happens with my both fvwm and fvwm2 with both my custon .fvwm2rc
and the default .fvwm2rc
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the --with-x switch with the configure script.
Start Xdarwin with fvwm as your window manager
Start Dr Scheme

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:35:30 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
