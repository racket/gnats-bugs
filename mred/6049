>How-To-Repeat:
instianciate/show any window, and then bring a DrScheme window to front.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    After some experimentation, to the best of my knowledge it
    appears that I cannot do a good job with this unless I get
    some help from mred itself, preferably a function that 
    returns the label of the frame without calling the
    (potentially overridden) get-label method.
    
    I also tried to interpose on (lib "mred.ss" "mred") to provide
    that function myself and was able to do so, but was not able
    to re-instantiate the interposing module in the new namespace,
    which means that drscheme running inside drscheme won't work
    properly.
