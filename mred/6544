>Description:
Adding a Teachpack requires clicking on Language->Add Teachpack...  This
pops up an Open window where directories are displayed on the left, files on the
right.  One would expect to be able to double-click on the directory on the left and have its files displayed on the right for selection.  This doesn't work.  Alternatively, one would expect that if the directory on the left is highlighted, hitting <return> will cause the highlighted directory's files to appear on the right.  This also doesn't work.

The only way to navigate to a directory from the Open window is to go to the bottom box and manually append (manually type) the desired directory to the displayed
path.  E.G. , to get to the htdp directory containing htdp teachpacks one must go to the bottom box and append the desired directory from the top left window. Also, to go back to the higher level, one must place the cursor in the bottom box, backspace over the subdirectory and hit <return>.
>How-To-Repeat:
Select "Language->Add Teachpack..." from the menu bar.  Try double-clicking on a directory in the left window, or highlighting an entry and hitting return.  Neither work.
