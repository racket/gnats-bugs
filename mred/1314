>Description:
The post-script-dc class under windows 
only works if interactive? is #t. The
postscript file is not created.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define filename "tmp.ps")
(when (file-exists? filename)
  (delete-file filename))
(define dc
  (let ([ps-setup (make-object ps-setup%)])
    (send ps-setup copy-from (current-ps-setup))
    (send ps-setup set-file filename)
    (parameterize ([current-ps-setup ps-setup])
      (make-object post-script-dc% #f))))
(send dc start-doc "t")
(send dc start-page)
(send dc draw-line 0 0 100 100)
(send dc end-page)
(send dc end-doc)
(printf "ok? ~a file-exists? ~a~n" (send dc ok?) (file-exists? filename))

 Set the mode in the ps-setup% to 'file. It's 'preview by default.
 
 The docs specify the default for X only. My intention was probably that
 it should be 'file for other platforms, but I didn't get the docs or
 (revised) implementation right. I'll fix them both, but you can't go
 wrong by setting the mode to 'file explicitly.

 Somehow passing interactive? as #t sets the mode, I guess. That was what
 confused me. I expected if I didn't change any defaults in the dialog I
 shouldn't have to call any methods of the ps-setup.
 
 Thanks!
