>Description:
On the Macintosh, the action or confirmation button is always
rightmost on the dialog and Cancel is usually left of it. 
This might be different on other platforms, but it would be good if
DrScheme and the framework in general automatically adjusted such
button positions according to the usual conventions of the
target platform. 

Perhaps something useful todo for the framework. (On the other hand,
there might be pedagogical reasons speaking against it.)

 Can you check the standard file open dialog and the preferences dialogs
 in IE and/or Word for the order of the buttons under Windows?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 In IE6, the File|Open dialog has buttons, from left to right,
 OK|Cancel|Browse.  The Tools|Internet Options dialog has buttons
 OK|Cancel|Apply.
 
 In Word and Excel XP, the File|Open dialogs have the buttons stacked
 vertically, and OK is above Cancel.  The Options dialogs have buttons OK
 and Cancel left-to-right.

 Great. So, MacOS and Windows are backwards. Sigh.

    I've fixed all of the framework and drscheme dialogs.
    I'm moving this to you since there are still some
    built-in dialogs that don't have the right order, I
    believe.
