>Description:
When Dr.Scheme encounters a file it cannot open (i.e. trying to open a 205.5 file with 203, or a mangled 205.5 file in 205.5) it does fail to open the file, but it still sets the "current file name" (seen in the window title bar, etc.) to the name of the file that the user attempted to open. Thus, if the user saves in this window, the file that Dr.Scheme couldn't open gets clobbered. Obviously the correct behavior would be to either leave the window as "Untitled (if no file was open previously) or not open a new window (if another file is already open) - or at the very least ask the user what to do.

 This PR seems to be something that should be handled at the mred level,
 I think. Based on the following interaction:
 
 First, I added an XML box to a file and saved it in /home/robby/tmp.ss.
 Then, I opened it with vi and scrambled the contents (leaving the
 WXME106 at the front intact). Then I ran this:
 
   (define t (new text%))
   (send t load-file "/home/robby/tmp.ss")
 
 and got an error in the last call:
 
   insert-file in text%: error loading the file
 
 but this:
 
   (send t get-filename)
 
 still produces:
 
   "/home/robby/tmp.ss"
 
 which seems to be why drscheme's GUI is updated as it is, and why save
 works the way it does.
