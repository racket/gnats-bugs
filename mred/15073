>Description:
There are still some race conditions left with the animation
system. ... Investigating stock games: Rummy does not have any other
user controls. Spider's animations are usually to fast to enter the
race condition but you might want to undo a move (with CMD-Z as a
keyboard shortcut on the Mac) during the animation. Crazy 8s features
an on-table user control: the clear button. It is blocked during
animation. Then there is an option button in the panel but it creates
another table on screen. Blackjack: on-table controls n/a during
animation. Aces: undo via keyboard shortcut during animation leaves
the cards on the stacks but face down. Clicking them provokes another
deal onto the stacks from the deck and other non regular behavior.
Memory and Go Fish do not have any in-game user controls.

It doesn't seem to be possible to protect from these race conditions completely as they originate from the nested event event handling of custom user controls and we don't know about ongoing animations in the Library. Perhaps some accessible mutex / semaphore on animation would be helpful.
 The games without controls from the toolkit incl. menu but with on-table button regions only do not have that problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the undo keyboard shortcut during a card animation either in Spider or Aces.

Reason>>> Thanks for the analysis and report!

The library attempted to avoid these problems by disabling
the card-table canvas, which is not good enough.

I believe the solution is to simply not handle events while
animating. Events were handled originally due to
limitations of `racket/gui` that required handling events
to let the screen refresh, but that limitation is long
since gone.

Commit 54c4505522 in the "games" package repo switches
animating to use `sleep` instead of `yield`.
