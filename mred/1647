MS Windows 95
>Description:
I don't know how to type the backslash character (\) when working
in the Scheme environment. The normally-used combination of the keys
"Right Alt" and "question mark" doesn't work. This is probably due to
the Windows driver for a German keyboard. With the "English" driver
it is ok.
By the way, in Linux no such problem exists!

 Thank you for the bug report.
 
 I don't have such a keyboard to test out, but I believe that if you 
 insert a semi-colon at the front of line 943 in 
 plt/collects/framework/keymap.ss, which looks like this:
 
            (map-meta "\\" "remove-space")
 
 your should be able to type the basckslash character.
 
 Please let me know if that works. If so, since we are re-releasing 
 windows 103 for other reasons today, we will include that change into 
 the released version.
 
 Thanks!

 Great! Glad to hear that it works. Hopefully we can get that 
 integrated into 103.
 
 Thanks again for the bug report!
