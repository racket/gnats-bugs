>How-To-Repeat:
put this in a file:

(begin
  (printf "2~n")
  (send (make-object dialog% "dialog" #f 400 400) show #t))

then start up mred with:

% mred -f filename.ss

The dialog that appears has a white border that "picks up" whatever
part of the stdout window is on top of it. Too see what I mean, position
the dialog so that the scroll bar on the stdout window overlaps with the
white region at the top of the dialog. Then, send the dialog to the
back and bring it back to the front (with alt-tab). The white space
at the top now has the image of the scroll bar in it. This is not just
a redrawing glitch either, that section of the scroll bar is really in
there -- moving the window around doesn't make it go away.

 Fixed for 103.2.
 
 (Took me two hours to figure out the stupid thing that C++ was doing to
 my program! Never depend on method overriding from within a constructor
 or destructor.)
