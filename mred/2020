>Description:
I would have expected the code below to produce a horizontal swatch of the
funny-bitmap, instead it produces a triangle pattern. This seems wierd
since last and second to last arguments are always 32 apart and, according
to the docs, those arguments control the height of the section drawn. Also, 
the second argument is a constant, so the sections aren't moving up, either 
(this you can also tell from the picture -- the triangle is actually in the 
right place in the canvas)

 The following lines in wx_dccan2.cc (580-583) look suspicious to me:
 
  		if (ixsrc + height > source->GetHeight())
 		  height = source->GetHeight() - ixsrc;
 		if (iysrc + width > source->GetWidth())
 		  width = source->GetWidth() - iysrc;

Responsible-Changed-Why:

Those lines were indeed the problem. I hjave transferred this PR to John,
since he has modified that file and I'm not sure if it can be tagged now.

I have checked in a changed version of the file that fixes the bug. cvs
update should have no troulbe applying the change to John's current
version.

I moved the responsibility to John just so that he can close the PR when he 
releases the code.
