>Description:
Text editors display a background color that is different to white only for normal ASCII characters correctly, but displays a white background for extended character sets (like the German Umlaute or sharp-s). - tested on Mac OS X 10.2
>How-To-Repeat:
In a text% class, put a public method:

(define (set-color which color start end)
      (let ((delta (make-object style-delta%)))
        (cond ((equal? which 'foreground) (send delta set-delta-foreground color))
              ((equal? which 'background) (send delta set-delta-background color))
              (else (error "set-color in text%: <which> color must be in (foreground background)")))
        (send this change-style delta start end)))

Then put (set-color 'background "LightBlue" 0 'end) somewhere in the initialization. Type special characters like ÄöÜÖäß

--> Special characters have white background while ordinary ASCII characters have blue background.
