>Release:        52 exp
>Environment:
MS Windows NT
>Description:
Unlike the other menus, the new Windows menu
is missing an accelerator key (indicated by &
in the string constant).

I suggest that W be the accelerator.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrScheme in Windows. Look at the menubar.

P.S. This was revealed by the test suite!
