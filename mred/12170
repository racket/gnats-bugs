>Description:
The following program works fine from DrRacket but not from gracket.

It gives the following error:

racket/gui/base is not available

 === context ===
/Users/eric/tmp/pict.rkt: [running body]
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require slideshow/pict)
(show-pict (rectangle 100 100))

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by endobson at Tue, 17 Mar 2015 01:04:18 -0400
Reason>>> This is expected because gracket does not load the gui libraries if the 
command line is just "gracket <module.rkt>"
