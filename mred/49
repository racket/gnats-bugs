I typed (exit) in the REP and got

There is indeed no such file, though I didn't do anything that might
have deleted it.  It also printed

current-directory: unknown failure

to the console.
>How-To-Repeat:
Dunno.  Now when I run DrScheme, it asks me whether I want to exit,
though I had set up a preference to not exit.  It seems like it just
deleted my .mred.prefs file somehow.

State-Changed-Why:
See pr 45 for close-directory's problem. Robby has also switched to
using 'truncate so that .mred.prefs is not deleted in case of a
problem.
