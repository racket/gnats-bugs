>Description:
I just downloaded v301 to my laptop running Fedora Core 5.
When I start DrScheme, I get the splash screen, and a few 
of the tool icons.  The program segfaults before I see 
the main DrS frame.

This is a new HP laptop with a Centrino DuoCore.  That 
CPU has a lot of errata, so the problem could be hardware-related.

Then again, I haven't had problems with other software in the 
few weeks I've been using the laptop.

 My guess is that this is a font problem now fixed in 301.x. If you have
 some time, could you try 301.13 (or later) to see if that fixes the
 problem?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Can you get a stack trace, or is all debugging info stripped away?

 Not sure how to get a stack trace in Linux, but I'm emailing you 
 the result of "strace drscheme".

 That's unlikely to help.
 
 Try
 
  % gdb mred
  (gdb) run -mvqM drscheme
   <crashes>
  (gdb) where
