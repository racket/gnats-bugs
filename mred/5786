 This could be a bug in the printer driver, or maybe not.
 
 Does the crash depend on the contents of the definitions window?  Or
 will anything there result in a crash?
 
 I just tried printing from Win2k -- no problem.
 
 I'll have to try printing from Win98 tonight.

 I tried printing from a DrScheme definitions buffer under Win98 at home.
 
 A Windows test page printed fine; so did a page in IE6.
 
 With DrScheme, even though I had only a couple of lines=20
 in the buffer, Windows thought there were 32000 pages.
 I tried to Print All: a dialog briefly flashes, then no output.
 So I tried to print just the first page, same result.
 
 I didn't get a crash, but I wasn't able to print anything, either.
 
 All this was with v202.

 Actually, DrScheme won't run under Windows 98 now.
 On startup, I get a fatal wxWindows error message, 
 something about a "cursorless class".  This happens when 
 running plain MrEd, too.
 
 The same DrScheme.exe in the same plt tree runs 
 fine under WinXP.  DrScheme v202 runs fine under 
 my Win98.

 Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll look into that.
 
 Thanks,

 I've exp-tagged a change that should fix this.

 I downloaded new binaries (no other files).
 
 DrScheme starts up now (although there's some non-fatal error -- 
 I think that's just my failure to update collections).
 
 The print menu still says "all 32000 pages".  I chose that and 
 hit OK.  The printer seems to reset, but I get no output.

 Does a little printing-in-progress dialog pop up with a "Cancel"
 button (and the PLT logo for the window's title bar)?
 
 Thanks,

 I don't think so -- I'll reboot into Win98 and check later today.

 Sorry, I was wrong.  The cancel dialog does appear in both WinXP
 and Win98 (though I don't see the PLT logo in either case).
 Printing succeeds in WinXP, but not in Win98.

 If you're willing to keep trying variations, does the program print
 anything in Windows 98?
 
  (define dc (make-object printer-dc%))
  (send dc start-doc "test")
  (send dc start-page)
  (send dc draw-text "Hello" 30 30)
  (send dc end-page)
  (send dc end-doc)
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I get the Windows print dialog.  This time, the 
 choices are "All" and a page range.  For "All", it 
 does *not* say "32000 pages", which is good :-)
 
 However, there's no printout, not even a printer 
 reset.  DrScheme shows a result of #f for that 
 series of expressions.
