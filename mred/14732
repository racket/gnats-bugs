>Description:
Win8 64-bit with DrRacket 32-bit

Very soon after opening up DrRacket, it crashes.

Sometimes a console widow opens up with the title, “C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket\DrRacket.exe” and displaying:
Seg fault (internal error) at dbb39a0
Seg fault (internal error) at dbb39a0

Yes, twice, whether I have one or two DrRacket windows open.

With or without the console window, Win8 gives a dialog with message “Racket GUI application has stopped working” with choices to:
Check online for a solution and close the program
Close the program
Debug the program

I took down some info from following the Debug option, with MSVS installed, if you're interested.
>How-To-Repeat:
Double click on a .rkt file.
Move the window around a little bit.  Or resize it.

 Stacktrace information would be really great! Did you get that from MSVS?

 Thanks for the quick response.  I didn't get a stacktrace.  Below is what I did, but first an update.
 
 1.  I rebooted.  No change.  Easily and quickly reproducible.  I rebooted to try to rule out the system being overtaxed.  It's an old machine.
 
 2.  I uninstalled DrRacket 32-bit and installed the 64-bit Windows version.  It's working now.  I'm sorry I didn't leave things installed.  I had grading to get done. 
 
 Regards,
 Paul
 
 The rest of what I had done before I uninstalled:
 
 If I click Debug as opposed to Close, I get a MS Visual Studio JIT Debugger dialog giving me the option to run an MSVS debugger instance on
 “An unhandled win32 exception occurred in DrRacket.exe [4544].”
 
 If I tell it to do so, MSVS opens up with a window reading,
 “Unhandled exception at 0x68de6da8 in DrRacket.exe: 0xC000041D: An unhandled exception was encountered during a user callback.”
 
 Hitting Continue in the box just brings the box again.  Hitting break allows me to show the disassembly.  I show an excerpt below:
 The highlighted line was

 I just saw this happening on one of my student's laptops, so I polled the class on our web forum and received five additional responses immediately.  So there is something going on here.
 
 We're at IU with Sam.
 
 I've told the students to switch to the 64-bit version, and I've asked them let know if the bug reappears afterward.

 Hi Paul,
 
 Can you try the following:
 
  - open up this file: "Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\share\pkgs\gui-pkgs\gui-lib\mred\private\wx\win32\dc.rkt"
  - Make the change represented by this commit:
 https://github.com/plt/racket/commit/641fa5f744
 
 And see if that causes DrRacket to no longer crash?
 
 Sam

 Hi Paul,
 
 Can you try the following:
 
  - open up this file: "Program Files
 (x86)\Racket\share\pkgs\gui-pkgs\gui-lib\mred\private\wx\win32\dc.rkt"
  - Make the change represented by this commit:
 https://github.com/plt/racket/commit/641fa5f744
 
 And see if that causes DrRacket to no longer crash?
 
 Sam

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 28 Sep 2014 10:52:26 -0400
Reason>>> Tracked down to a problem in Cairo, where a workaround was in place
for 64-bit mode but not 32-bit mode. We've patched Cairo to repair
the problem (in both variants).
