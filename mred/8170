>Description:
The MrEd Graphical Toolbox Manual, section 8, provides the following two snippets of code:

(define f (instantiate frame% ("Simple Edit" #f 200 200)))
(define c (instantiate editor-canvas% (f)))
(define t (instantiate text% ()))
(send c set-editor t)
(send f show #t)

(define mb (instantiate menu-bar% (f)))
(define m-edit (instantiate menu% ("Edit" mb)))
(define m-font (instantiate menu% ("Font" mb)))
(append-editor-operation-menu-items m-edit)
(append-editor-font-menu-items m-font)

It then says:

"Now, the standard cut and paste operations work, and the user can even set font styles. The user can also insert an embedded editor by selecting Insert Text from the Edit menu; after selecting the menu item, a box appears in the editor with the caret inside. Typing with the caret in the box stretches the box as text is added, and font operations apply wherever the caret is active. Text on the outside of the box is rearranged as the box changes sizes. Note that the box itself can be copied and pasted."

No such "Insert Text" menu item is actually present.  The item should be added or the documentation should be changed.  (If the item is not added, presumably there should be another code sample added that does demonstrate an embedded editor.)

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 15 Nov 2006 17:50:55 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed the example to supply #f to `append-editor-operation-menu-items'
