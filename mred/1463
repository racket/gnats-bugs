>Description:
I have successfully installed DrScheme 101 on Windows 98 (Japanese Edition).
When I try to run DrScheme, error message is displayed and DrScheme crashed.

Error message is like below (translation from Japanese):
Page fault of MRED.
Module : MRED.EXE, address : 0167:00404601

I can run MzScheme, so it seems that a problem related to MrEd.
I also tried to run DrScheme on Windows 2000, but same problem occured.
This problem happens not only on my PC, but also another Windows 98 (Japanese Edition) PC.

State-Changed-Why:
With Yasuhiro's help, we found the problem: MrEd was using
WM_USER+1 as its own private message ID. Apparently, apps
are only supposed o use WM_USER+0x100 and higher. (So why
not make the safe area the value of the macro?!?!?!)

I changed MrEd to use WM_USER+0x111.
