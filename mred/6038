 How do you change the input method?  Is that a feature 
 in Windows XP?

 OK, I've figured out how to change the input method on Windows 2000.  I
 must not have Korean support installed, but I was able to change to
 other languages.
 
 On Windows 2000, at least, you can quickly change the input method from
 a menu that appears in the taskbar.  As a workaround, you could switch
 to English when using DrScheme.  
 
 You're right, there's no Unicode support in DrScheme.  Unicode support
 is something that there's been no consensus for among Scheme
 implementations.

    This is almost fixed for the next release. It's certainly
    fixed for a Chinese input method, at least.
    
    To be clear, there's still no Unicode support. But
    MrEd won't hang.
