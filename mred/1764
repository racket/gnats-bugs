>Description:
I would like to, in response to `on-insert' clean up a
buffer (the idea is to annotate the program with spidey
info, but when the user types to clear out the spidey info).
this means that I should override on-insert and delete
the stuff from the buffer. The insert, however, is silently
ignored (not even an error message).

If I try the same trick with after-insert, things work just
fine.

(define t%
  (class text% ()
    (inherit insert)
    (private [already-in-after? #f]
	     [already-in-on? #f])
    (rename [super-after-insert after-insert]
	    [super-on-insert on-insert])
    (override
     [after-insert
      (lambda args
	(unless already-in-after?
	  (set! already-in-after? #t)
	  (printf "inserting~n")
	  (insert "a")
	  (printf "inserted~n"))
	(apply super-after-insert args))]

	(apply super-on-insert args))])
    (sequence
      (super-init))))

 If you mean that `on-insert' can't insert into its editor, that's
 a documented limitation.

 Sorry. Please consider this a change-request (of low priority -- I 
 have hacked around the problem using after-insert and some careful 
 updates of the new positions of things to remove from the buffer).
