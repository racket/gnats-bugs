>Description:
the following text is taken from the "change-style" page of the 
text% docs:

*(send a-text change-style delta start end) -> void
    delta : style-delta% object
    start : exact non-negative integer or 'start
    end = 'end : exact non-negative integer or 'end

Changes the style for a region in the editor by applying a style 
delta. If start is 'start and end is 'end, then the currently 
selected items are changed. Otherwise, if and end is 'end, then 
the style is changed from start until the end of the selection.

*(send a-text change-style style start end) -> void
    style : style<%> object
    start = 'start : exact non-negative integer or 'start
    end = 'end : exact non-negative integer or 'end

Changes the style for a region in the editor to a specific style. 
If start is 'start and end is 'end, then the currently selected 
items are changed. Otherwise, if and end is 'end, then the style 
is changed from start until the end of the selection.
 
===============

In particular, the phrase "Otherwise, if and "end" 'end, then..."
doesn't make sense to me.
