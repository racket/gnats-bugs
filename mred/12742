>Description:
The page:
http://doc.racket-lang.org/gui/style-delta_.html
includes some 14 or so function descriptions that are (otherwise empty) self-references, including functions set-smoothing-on and set-smoothing-off, get-size-in-pixels-on, get-size-in-pixels-off, etc..

In particular it would be nice to have a description of what function is enabled and disabled by set-transparent-text-backing-on and set-transparent-text-backing-off.

 Perhaps not a doc bug.
 
 Some of the self-references seemed to link straight back to themselves
 other than the (probable best) option of linking back to the top of the
 style-delta% page entry. And only then because of the state of the browser
 and/or session.
 
 However, while searching the docs it isn''t readily apparent to me what
 set-transparent-text-backing-on is doing. A little more explanation would
 be helpful.
