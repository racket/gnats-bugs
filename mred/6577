>Release:        205
>Environment:
linux-other
>Description:
When opening saved files that have had images inserted (via the "Special -> Insert Image..." menu), the images show up as x-ed out boxes (|X|) rather than the images that were previously inserted.

This appears to affect all files saved by the Linux version (i.e. images in a file saved by the Linux version show up as boxes when opened in both the Linux version and the Windows version of 205). However, the Linux version correctly displays images in files saved by the Windows release.

CVS release 205.5-cvs30oct2003 *appears* to work OK.

 Is this problem still pending?  I can't reproduce it on my system.
