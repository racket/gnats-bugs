>Description:
When I double-click on the drscheme icon, and drscheme is already running,
I get an error message instead of bringing drscheme to the front. (probably 
drag and drop also doesn't work, but I can't try thtat right now....).

Also, the drscheme icon doesn't gray out when drscheme is open. Probably
these problems are related. (like, the mini-drscheme app can stay open with 
a channel to mred to hand-off apple events or something)

State-Changed-Why:

Such is the architecture: launchers that start up MrEd and then
quit. There's nothing more useful that can be done in the near future.
