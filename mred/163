>Description:
	According to the documentation (and normal conventions) this
is supposed to work: (make-object mred:connections-media-canvas% p),
where p is a panel. Instead, this error message is reported:
initialization for class derived from #<class:wx:media-canvas%>:
expects 9 arguments, given 5: #<object:wx:panel%> -1 -1 50 50


	[Actually, the documentation says that the first initialization
argument must be a frame, but this has already been fixed.]
>How-To-Repeat:
	(make-object mred:connections-media-canvas% p)
	where p is a panel
>Fix:

I fixed the bug and the file is in RCS. I won't check it out to -x 'til
later, to be sure it runs. (I'm 99% confident now, but just to be sure...)
