>Description:
The first graphic on this page is unreadable in my Netscape browser.
Since it is the only graphic I have found like this I conclude that
it is a problem with the graphic.  The graphic is a line of text that
appears just below the first paragraph beneath the line that ends:
"line such as this one:"  It appears that this text/graphic is so long
that it is overwriting itself.
>How-To-Repeat:
View this page in Netscape 4.72.
