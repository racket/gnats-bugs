>Description:
When I click check-syntax the drr window gets blacked out
before it's refreshed.  If I then do any edit and check
syntax again, the screen blacks out again.  (This is for a
visible period, looks like somewhere around 300ms.)

 This happens on my machine (also Linux) as well.

 The editor is blank for as long as it takes Check Syntax to do its job.
 That's because Check Syntax issues a `begin-edit-sequence' before
 starting its work but after showing the status line; the editor canvas
 needs to be refreshed after being resized, but it can't be refreshed
 because the editor is in an edit sequence.
 
 
 With 5.0.2, the canvas is empty under Linux and not under Mac OS X
 while Check Syntax runs. The problem is the same, it's just that an
 unrefreshed canvas in v5.0.2 Mac OS X keeps whatever bits happened to
 be in the window already, instead of erasing the canvas.
 
 
 One way to solve the problem is to encourage a refresh just before the
 `(begin-edit-sequence)'. That's a little tricky, because some
 unspecified number of `yield's are needed to allow the resize events to
 flow through.
 
 A better way is probably to rely less on editor sequences. The problem
 may be that parsing the program for Check Syntax requires reading from
 the editor, and it's not entirely clear when that's safe (e.g.,
 resizing the window might cause snips to be split in a way that
 invalidates the port's tracking of where it is in the editor). The
 solution may be to do something more like the syntax colorer, where the
 main thread doesn't run while the reading thread proceeds, and if the
 editor changes in between reading slices, the old port is thrown away
 and a new one is created.

 Would changing the ordering of these things help a little bit in the short =
 term?

 Under 5.0.2, the blanked screen was white on Linux, whereas it's now
 black.  I think white is preferable - it looks busy rather than
 broken.  Would it be possible to make blanked screens white?

 No, not that I can tell.
