>Description:
	When I edit Scheme code, I often type "Ctl-A tab". This gets me
to the effective beginning of the line under X. Under Windows, it starts
tabifying the whole buffer. This can be a very time-consuming process:
6 minutes for a 1000 line file on Ollie. Is it reasonable to spend
an average of 3 seconds to tabify a line? And if so, can the tabifying
process be made interruptable?
>How-To-Repeat:
	Select everything in a large file and type Tab
>Fix:
