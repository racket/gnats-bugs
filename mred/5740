 Steve,
 
 	In case no one has responded, John Clements has discovered:
 
 --------------------------
 
 I can confirm what 3 bug reports have pointed out: running Setup PLT 
  on Mac OS Classic is broken.  In particular, I observe the following 
  sequence of events, when booted into OS 9:
  
  1) unpack distribution
  2) double-click on Setup PLT
  ... Setup PLT immediately halts, and no other applications are running.
  3) double-click on MrEd
  ... Takes about 30 seconds, but MrEd starts up.
  4) Quit MrEd
  5) double-click on Setup PLT
  ... This time, MrEd starts up, and runs GLACIALLY.  TECTONICALLY, 
  even.  After five minutes, it's on the third collection.
  
 -----------
