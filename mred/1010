1. execute the following program:

(require-library "framework.ss" "framework")

(define my-frame (make-object frame:basic% "Test Frame"))
(define my-canvas (make-object editor-canvas% my-frame))
(define my-text (make-object text:basic%))

(send my-canvas min-width 200)
(send my-canvas min-height 200)

(send my-text insert "This is some text")
(send my-text highlight-range 3 6 (make-object color% 98 21 198) #f #f)
(send my-canvas set-editor my-text)


(send my-frame show #t)

2. using the corner-resizer-thumb-thingy, make the window small.  Try at least twice.
