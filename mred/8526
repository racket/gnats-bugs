>Description:
If you select "Print Interactions", the OS X print dialog comes up.  When you hit "print", OS X reports that "DrScheme quit unexpectedly".  Happens every time.  Comments:
-- Sending to a different printer is fine.  Seems to be some interaction with the HP3800dn driver. Perhaps something about newer generation HP drivers?
-- I have not noticed this with other applications --- they print to this printer just fine.
-- If it has some issue with this driver, it should report it elegantly, not just crash!
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme
Select Print Interactions (OS X print dialog opens)
Select the HP3800 printer.
Push "print".
DrScheme crashes hard, OS X reports "app quit unexpectedly".

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
