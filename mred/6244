>Description:
On two occasions this week files that I created with
Dr. Scheme version 203 for Mac OS X became corrupted
by other applications. Once a source file was overwritten with an e-mail attachment (received presumably by Mail, which was running concurrently). Today another version of the same was overwritten with
about 60 lines that resemble the following:

2003-05-02 16:50:18 EDT - Network transition occurred.
2003-05-02 16:50:19 EDT - Network transition occurred.
2003-05-02 16:50:20 EDT - Unregistered node ~AppleTalk~*
2003-05-02 16:50:20 EDT - Network transition occurred.
2003-05-02 16:50:21 EDT - Unregistered node ~AppleTalk~*
2003-05-02 16:50:21 EDT - Network transition occurred.
2003-05-02 16:50:22 EDT - Network transition occurred.
2003-05-02 16:50:23 EDT - Network transition occurred.
2003-05-02 16:50:24 EDT - Network transition occurred.

I am certain that the Dr. Scheme application was not running at the time. So the problem is likely elsewhere. However that both affected files were
created and modified by Dr. Scheme is interesting.  Please let me know if anyone else has reported a similar mishap.
