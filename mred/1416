 There's no where else to put it. Without any further information, it
 doesn't seem like the dialog should encourage either a "Yes" or "No"
 answer.

 Well, the text box seems like the wrong place. Perhaps the panel with the
 "yes" and "no" answer? Or have two flags '(yes-no) and '(no-yes) or maybe
 add another flag '(yes-no no-default) vs '(yes-no yes-default)?
