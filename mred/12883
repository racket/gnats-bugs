>Description:
I use 'xmodmap' to rebind my keys to a non-standard configuration. The DrRacket keybindings that involve the Meta key do not work for me even though I'm pressing the key that 'xev' reports as being the Meta key.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Save this file to /tmp/xmodmaprc: http://pastebin.com/QNShaxSp
2. Use 'xev' to adjust the keycodes so they match your keyboard.
3. $ xmodmap /tmp/xmodmaprc
4. In DrRacket, try to use a keybinding involving the Meta key, e.g. 'M-<'

 The synopsis of this bug is incorrect. It reflects my initial
 hypothesis of why I was observing this behavior, but on further
 investigation, I don't think it is correct.
 
 It should probably read: "M-* keybindings not actually bound to Meta key"
