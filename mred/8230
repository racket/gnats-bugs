>Environment:
windows-xp
>Description:
Passing (eval <symbol>) to the display function causes a Microsoft XP error but only when executed in the form of a MrEd executable.  More specifically, (display (eval ''x)) will cause an error if you make an MrEd executable, but not from MzScheme executable or in the DrScheme editor.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using Windows XP Professional Operating system and DrScheme v352, make a *.scm source file with the following source code:

  (display (eval ''x))

Save the file.
Set the language to Graphical (MrEd).  
Click 'Scheme' and 'Create-executable.'
Execute it.

Reason>>> This is fixed in our SVN repository for the next release. The
bug was in the implementation of MrEd's "sandard output"
window.

Thanks for the report!
