>Description:
In DrScheme 206 for linux, resizing the window causes the
entire gui to temporarily hang as it attempts to keep up
and fails. I think it's because drscheme can't cope with 
the large number of refresh requests it gets when 
"Show window contents while resizing" is set in the 
window manager. After it catches back up, normal 
operation resumes.

I've compiled DrScheme from source, using the gentoo 
ebuild. This unfortuately means I get bitten by the 
optimization bug that I HOPE someone else has reported, 
but if not is detailed here: 

http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32003
This is for 205, but the problem is the same in 206.

So, I have to compile with --enable-noopt.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Set window manager to "Show window contents while resizing"
2. Drag the window out horizontally ("maximize" does not do this, since it only sends 1 refresh)

 It looks like the problem is that repaints should be canceled if there
 are later repaints for the same region.  (This is obvious by the
 effect of the window contents slowly lagging behind user resizes.)
 
 When I did this for a long time, mred was stuck at 100% cpu and
 drscheme lost all gui elements (buttons, menu etc).

Reason>>> This is considerably improved in the latest v299.

Refresh events are more agressively collapsed, but the big
different is that MrEd consults the X server (not its
widget) to get the size of a frame, which avoids useless
intermediate resizes.
