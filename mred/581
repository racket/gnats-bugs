(current-directory
 (build-path "Cupertino:"
	     "Robby"
	     "plt"
	     "collects"
	     "icons"))
(define frame (make-object wx:frame% null "test" 100 100 100 100))
(define panel (make-object wx:panel% frame))
(define button (make-object wx:button% panel (lambda x (cb)) "not running"))
(send button set-label (make-object wx:bitmap% "snoopy-active.gif"))

The gif file in question is also in /home/robby/ on cs. I didn't try this
on other platforms.
