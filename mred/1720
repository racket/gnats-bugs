>Description:
; An empty frame, if it has BOTH its width and height set to
; non-stretchable, actually is stretchable.  (This is MacOS; haven't
; tried it elsewhere).
;
; Once an item is inserted into the frame, it works okay
; (hence a pretty unimportant bug).
;
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "unexpectedly stretchable" #f 200 300))
(send f show #t)
(send f stretchable-height #f)
(send f stretchable-width  #f)

; This will fix f:
;(define p (make-object panel%  f '(border)))

I failed to notice that Matthew had already claimed this one.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 16 Sep 2004 15:34:05 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed (in well under four years, and not quite nine versions of DrScheme).
