>Description:
If an overriden read method returns an inadmissible
value, mred gets wedged.

It starts dumping junk to stdout when trying to copy,
after evaluating the program below.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define renderable-snipclass%
  (class snip-class% ()
    (override
      [read

         'invalid-return
         
         )])
    (sequence (super-init))))

(define snipclass (make-object renderable-snipclass%))
(send snipclass set-version 1)
(send snipclass set-classname "test")
(send (get-the-snip-class-list) add snipclass)

(define my-snip%

       (lambda (dc . rest)

    (inherit set-snipclass)
    (sequence

      (set-snipclass snipclass))))

(define c (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send t insert (make-object my-snip%))
(send t set-position 0 1)
(send t cut)

 In general, if there's a problem writing to a file, all editors get
 stuck for file-writing or cut-and-paste. Fixing this problem is the one
 large-scale change that I have planned.
