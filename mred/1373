>Description:
When calling put-file in mred, if a frame is passed to the put-file,
all of the keystrokes that happen in the text at the bottom
of the put-file dialog are duplicated to the frame.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 200))
(make-object button% "button" f (lambda x (put-file "put-file" f)))
(send (make-object editor-canvas% f (make-object text%)) focus)
(send f show #t)
;; click the button (making sure that the focus is to the text)
;; type some stuff in the put-file dialog.
;; click "save".
;; see the same keystrokes occur in the text.
