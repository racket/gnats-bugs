MS Windows 98
>Description:
Within the editor, there seems be a intermittant problem when copying sections of code.  It's as if the copying process doesn't "take".  In other words, I highlight the code, select Edit-Copy (or use Ctrl-C) to send it to the clipboard.  When I paste, I either get nothing or I get the leftovers of a previous copy attempt.  

The problem is very minor and difficult to make repeat.  But, it has happened enough times that I'm sure it's not just a erroneous keystroke on my part.

Otherwise, Scheme is working very happily on my Windows 98 platform.  :-)

 Gee, I hate it when I answer my own questions.  It was my fault.  *sigh*
 When the text is grey-highlighted from matching parenthesis, it "looks"
 highlighted, but is not.  So, therefore the copy command does no good until
 you really highlight it.
 
 Sorry to trouble you.
