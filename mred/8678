Resizing dragable panel causes frame to resize beyond screen extent.
(I figure it shouldn't resize the frame at all)
>How-To-Repeat:
move the draggable bar upwards  - then wiggle it up and down.

 Matthew: the problem here seems to be list-box specific (at least it
 isn't a problem for an editor-canvas).
 
 The vertical-dragable panel is telling something that should be able
 to go down to 80 pixels to go down to 83 or 82, but it doesn't. That's
 what triggers the bad behavior.
 
 To see this in action, run the program below, now the one in the PR.
 Add a print out in the place-children method on line 301 (not the
 other one) to print out this-space in the last cond clause of that
 function. That's the amount of space it is giving to the list-box. You
 can see it isn't below the min-height.
 
 Is that enough to help you find the bug? If you'd like a direct
 program, I can do that, later on.
 
 Robby

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:49 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
