>Description:
for some period of time (presumably while the syntax coloring task is
doing it's thing in the background), mouse drag and contunued mouse down
events don't seem to be being passed through to the definition edit
window frame?
>How-To-Repeat:
- open a large file, contract.ss for example.
- try to interactivly scroll the file, the scroll
bar moves but the text isn't updated untill released.
- try to keep the mouse pressed in an empty scroll
bar area to, the page scrolls once, then stops, as
opposed to continiously scrolling while the mouse
remains pressed.
- after 10-20 seconds, (smaller for smaller files),
normal expected mouse scrolling behavior resumes.

(seems like the processing of persistent mouse down event
 behavor is being temporaritly filtered duing this time,
 although the windowing/operating system apparetly handeling
 them, DrScheme/MrEd isn't, as the scroll bar moves interactivly,
 but not text is being scrolled?)

 correction: during this period the scroll bar doesn't move but when the
 mouse button is released, the display does scroll to the location the scroll
 bar would have been. (so it appears that the the drawing of the scroll bar
 is being inhibited during this period of time as well for some reason?)

State-Changed-Why:
    Interactive scrolling works only as long as MrEd isn't
    forced to switch threads.
    
    I need to look more closely to check whether interactive
    scrolling stops because a switch is really necessary, or
    merely because MrEd pessimistically views the 
    `(sleep 0.01)' as a thread switch.
