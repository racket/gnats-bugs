>Description:
Using Shift + the arrow keys to highlight text fails as described below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new window. Type a bunch of junk (> 15 lines, say). Resize the window so that only part of the last line is visible. Scroll so that there are lines that are out of view at the bottom of the screen. Place the cursor at the beginning of the last visible line. Hold down Shift+down.  The screen scrolls, but nothing is highlighted. (Text _is_ selected, however).

This bug is a bit flakey: it appears to depend on just _how_much_ of the partially visible line is displayed.

Fixed. The bug would happen when moving the selection caused a scroll,
and when the caret was blinked off at the time.
