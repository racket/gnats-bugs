>Description:
When I copy an image from a web page and try to paste it into the Definitions window I get the image plus a huge black box, and on occasion DrScheme freezes.
If I save the image to my disk first then use Insert Image... it works fine.  Something to do with Copy & Paste?
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Navigate to: http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~kfisler/TSRJ/2009/Labs/Monday-am-lab-new.html
2) Copy the soccer ball image, for example.
3) Open DrScheme and attempt to paste the image into Definitions window, with or without any other Scheme code.
4) BOOM!

 Hi,
 
 I did upgrade to 4.2. Perhaps an older version was linked from the
 desktop.  I'll check later today.

 Hi Again,
 
 I've checked and found that the icon was indeed linking to the older  
 version.  All fixed now.
 
 thanks,
 
 Jack
