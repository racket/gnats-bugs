 Around the time that this happens, does your caret flash, or does it
 get stuck on/off?
 
 In fixing a timer bug for Windows, I broke it again for X under certain
 circumstances, so if the only pending event is a timer event, it isn't
 handled right away. Unflashing the paren-flash is timer-based.

 It's stuck. 
 
 BTW, on occasion a single control char (say cntrl B) also makes the carrot
 disappear.

 I released new MrEd Solaris and Linux binaries to ~scheme/plt that
 should fix the problem.
