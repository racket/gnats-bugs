>Description:
When there is more than one pane in a window, the Mac UI standard is for the scrollwheel to operate exclusively on the pane that contains the /mouse/ cursor.

In contrast to this, DrScheme on the Mac alwyas scrolls the pane that has /keyboard/ focus--the one that contains the insertion point or selection.

The Mac implementation of DrScheme should follow the Mac UI standard in this regard as it does in so many other regards.

(The current DrScheme behavior is the standard behavior on MS Windows.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Put enough text in the definitions and listener panes for both to be scrollable.  Click in the definitions pane and then move the mouse to the listener pane.  Use the scroll wheel.  On a Mac, The listener pane should scroll, but instead the definitions pane scrolls.

To see an example of the correct behavior on a Mac, open Firefox and show bookmarks as a pane in the browser window.  (view/sidebar/bookmarks).  Resize the window so both the content area and the bookmarks have scrollbars.  See how the scrollwheel operates on the pane with the cursor in it (even if the other pane has a selection in it).

Note that even if only one pane is scrollable on a Mac, the scrollwheel does not cause it to scroll unless it contains the mouse.
