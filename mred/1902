>Description:
under macos (maybe others?) text-field disabling does not work
properly. There are two problems I see:

  1) until you click in the text-field, you can still type
     in the text-field.

  2) the text-field does not gray out

>How-To-Repeat:
;; for item 1)
;; evaluate this code:

(define frame (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400))
(make-object check-box% "Disable" frame (lambda (cb evt) (send tf enable (not (send cb get-value)))))
(define tf (make-object text-field% #f frame void))
(send frame show #t)

;; click in text-field
;; type "ttt"
;; click checkbox
;; type "sss" (see it appear in text-field -- it shouldn't)
;; click in checkbox
;; now checkbox is actually disabled

;; note that there is no graphical difference between the disabled
;; and enabled checkbox. That is item 2) above.
