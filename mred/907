>Description:
consider a file A.  suppose a region is selected from location l to location m in the old file, where l and m are distances from the beginning of the file.

Suppose the user copies this region.

Now, if this file changes on disk and is reverted, the region from l to m in the new document are selected. This region does not necessarily have any semantic connection with the region in the old file.  

Under X, when a region is selected, it winds up in the copy buffer. If the user then does a paste, rather than getting the region of the old file, he gets the region of the new file.

I claim that the only sensible behavior here is _not_ to make any selection at all upon a file that is reverted.

compromise (which John agreed to): only remember the start of the selection.
