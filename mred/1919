>Description:
Showing a frame should make it visible, but on the mac
it only brings it to the front, it does not un-"window shade"
the window.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; evaluate this:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 200 200))
(send f show #t)
;; click the right-most box (macos 9) in the title bar to shade the window
;; evaluate this:
(send f show #t)
;; the window remains shaded.
