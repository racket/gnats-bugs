 Probably you need 
 
   image1.gif
 
 DrScheme needs the full names of the images.

 You probably want `random'. Search in Help Desk for it. If you want to
 make it into a teachpack, save this in the file random.ss:
 
   (module random mzscheme
     (provide random))
 
 and that will be the teachpack.
 
 Or, if you are in one of the PLT languages, you can just use random
 directly.
