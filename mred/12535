>Description:
On MacOS X version 10.7.2, creating an executable as a Launcher, GRacket application, when the code begins with:
#lang racket/gui
creates a launcher script which dies with an error like:

standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found: "racket/gui/lang" in any of: (#<path:/Users/keith/Library/Racket/5.2/collects>)

 === context ===
standard-module-name-resolver
standard-module-name-resolver

Poking around reveals there is no /Users/keith/Library/Racket directory...
