>Description:
I know you all are getting tires of me, but I'm going to be in this class for a whole semester.  Here is a new problem....

I  save a copy of the interactions window.  (Like all good computer scientists, we keep copies and copies of our work.)  So, I highlight the stuff in the interactions window.  Copy it.  Then I open my notepad.  I paste.  Great.  It works.  But, that's the only time it works.  You see, I ran another program.  I highlighted the interactions.  I copied.  I opened a new notpad.  I pasted. And whalah.... I just pasted the interactions from the previous program I ran, not the one I just ran and copied the interactions from.  This program does not seem to release what's on the clipboard and allow something new to be copied onto it.  I had 7 programs that I had to do this for tonight.  So, guess what I had to do.  I had to erase the clipboard everytime before I copied onto it.
