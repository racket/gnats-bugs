I compiled PLT under ppc-linux from the source.

any clue? yrs, Edward Hoenkamp

NB I realize this is may not be a bug in PLT, but whereelse can I go. A
path that should be set?

 Sorry for the delayed response.
 
 I have no idea what is going on, but another Linux PPC user has
 reported the same problem. A quick Web search revealed a page about
 MkLinux:
   http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/mklinux/memo/diary.html
 
 According the entry dated May 8, there was some sort of required
 update to fix the "Unresolved inheritance operation" problems for
 programs using Athena widgets. MrEd/DrScheme does use Athena widgets.
 Is it possible that some part of your Linux installation needs to be
 updated?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Thank you Matthew for looking into this. I was on vacation (and really,
 really away from my mail), hence the late response. I'll try your advice.
 Edward.

I think this is resolved. Others are apparently building PPC Linux
versions without problems.
