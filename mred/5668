>Description:
When a button is clicked over a mred window,
mred brings the window to the front. I believe
that mred shouldn't bring the window to the
front until the mouse button is released in
the window, in the event of drag of drop.

The macos x finder brings windows to the front
on down clicks when there is nothing under
the mouse that can be dragged and brings it
to the front on up clicks when there is something
that can be dragged.

Reason>>> I believe the convention is for the window to be brought forward on the
down click, unless you click on something to drag.

So, when we get to drag-and-drop support, we'll naturally investigate
more, and things are working as well as they can in the meantime.
