 Matthew: this appears to be a -35 that's coming in to the
 scroll-editor-to method, which is then being forwarded to the admin's
 scroll-to method. Line 67 of the currently checked in
 first-line-text.ss.
 
 Or, if I simply change the definition of scroll-editor-to in
 first-line-text.ss to this:
 
     (define/override (scroll-editor-to localx localy width height refresh? bias)
       (super scroll-editor-to localx localy width height refresh? bias)
 
 the call to `super' fails because a -35 comes in and then is passed to
 the super.

 So we shouldn't turn it off.
 
 Can you create a small example? We need to publish more on contracts.  
 We had in mind a journal paper.

 Well, in this case, they're not even there to be turned on.
 
 But it is an interesting example. Many of the contracts can be turned
 off, but anytime there is new functionality it seems like you want to
 re-enable the contracts for the changed code.

 I should have done that to begin with.
 
 I just went and tried and ... I think Matthew may have already fixed the bug!
 
 Did you Matthew? (Do you know enough to put an explanation in the PR
 transcript?)
 
 Thanks,

 I am beginning to think that our conjecture about positive contract  
 checks being turned off is wrong in the presence of blame. We have no  
 proof. And this appears to be a counter-example.

 I always understood that if we wanted to supply the "Disable
 contracts" option at all, it should be a blame sensitive option. I
 think that the 'lifevests on land' thing still applies, but at least
 blame plays a role.
