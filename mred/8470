windows-xp
>Description:
Program crash, "MrEd-based application has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience". Occurs when a key is pressed on the keyboard while Dr Scheme has focus. Occurs in versions 352, 360 (current) and 369.3 (newest). MrEd and MzScheme work as separate applications, problem appears to be with Dr Scheme.

Can't enter a bug report because while the menus work, the action of typing causes the crash.

It's possible to paste text into the windows using the copy/paste buffer and a mouse.
>How-To-Repeat:
Take a fresh Windows XP machine, install any of PLT Scheme 352, 360 or 369.3, run Dr Scheme, attempt to enter a character into either pane of the Dr Scheme window using the keyboard. The program will crash every time.

 Have discovered the crash occurs when "All-chars", a macro package from
 http://allchars.zwolnet.com/ is active. On my system, with AllChars version
 3.6.2 activated, all versions of DrScheme I tried down to and including 350
 would crash as soon as a key was pressed. Firefox, Outlook, Xemacs and other
 software were not affected.

 All-Chars patch to 3.6.3 appears to fix the problem.

 Thanks for finding the problem.  It's good to know in case someone
 else runs into it.  I'll close the report now.
