>Description:
Running the program below in drracket and then clicking the button does not restore the focus back to drracket (but it should).

The same thing also happens with the 'goto line' (esc-g) keybinding.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define d (new dialog% [label "dialog"] [width 200] [height 200]))
(define b (new button% [label "button"] [callback (Î» x (send d show #f))] [parent d]))
(send d show #t)

 It sounds like your DrRacket is in a state where that will happen with
 most any frame. Does restarting DrRAcket fix it?
 
 I don't yet know what goes wrong, but I see this sometimes, too.

 Yeah, that did. Ugh. I should have tried that.

 I'll see if I see anything that triggers it...

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 02 Dec 2010 15:08:44 -0500
Reason>>> fixed a while back; the problem was related to
resizing a window with a registered GC blit
