State-Changed-Why:

Have you tried version 51 (released a few weeks ago)? Did it fix the
problem?

I haven't seen this problem, and I use Linux heavily. Since I can't
reproduce the problem, I'm hoping it was fixed along the way to 51.
(Certainly, many things related to event handling were fixed, but I
can't remember anything that would address your problem specifically.)
