>Description:
After switching from 199.21 to 199.22, DrScheme now dies
when loading my tool (or sometimes loads it ok, but dies when
I try to use the tool, depending on what exactly my code looks
like - even if the tool loads fine, I found out that using the
error function seems to be a sure way to kill drscheme)

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a tool with the following files:

info.ss:

(module info
        (lib "infotab.ss" "setup")
        
        (define name "MrSpidey")
        (define tools '(("foo.ss")))
        (define tool-icons '(("mrspidey.bmp" "icons")))
        (define tool-names '("DrScheme MrSpidey Static Debugger"))
        )

foo.ss:

(module
 foo mzscheme )

and start DrScheme. It dies right after the spidey icon shows up in
the startup window.

 Hi Philippe,
 
 Does this still happen? I've never been able to re-create the crash.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 No. It disappeared after a "make clean" + "make" in the mzscheme
 source directory...
