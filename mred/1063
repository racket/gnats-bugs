>Description:
MrEd PPC is unusable (i.e. fails to launch) under any system software earlier than 8.5.  Although I don't have intimate knowledge of the NavigationLib issue, I have seen this error in other alpha/beta stage software and it doesn't sound difficult to fix.  The NavigationLib is what enables the new Open/Save dialogs of OS 8.5.  There is a fix to allow the program to default to the older style Open/Save dialogs if the OS is 8.1 or earlier.
>How-To-Repeat:
Launching DrScheme or Help Desk or Games simply fails silently.  Launching MrEd PPC directly displays the error:
"The application "MrEd PPC" could not be opened because "NavigationLib" could not be found"
