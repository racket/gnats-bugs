>Description:
Under some circumstances on Linux (X windows), but not Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows, the get-pixel and get-argb-pixels methods on bitmap-dc%, and in the latter case also on bitmap%, return incorrect RGB values when applied to a monochrome bitmap.  Namely, rather than white pixels showing as 255 for R, G, and B and black pixels showing as 0 for R, G, and B, the values of R and G are always 0 and the B is 0 for white and 1 for black.  For example, the code shown in the "Steps to Reproduce" section of this bug report will give a byte string containing the incorrect RGB values under Linux (look for \0\0\1) whereas under MacOS X it gives a byte string contining the correct RGB values. This particular example illustrates the bug in the get-argb-pixels operation on bitmap%; if the bitmap is left set into the dc and the dc's get-argb-pixels operation is used, the problem does not manifest.  However, under other circumstances the bitmap-dc% operations (get-argb-pixels and get-pixel)!
  can also manifest the same misencoding.
>How-To-Repeat:
(let* ((bm (make-object bitmap% 5 5 #t))
       (dc (new bitmap-dc% (bitmap bm)))
       (pt (lambda (x y) (make-object point% x y)))
       (bs (make-bytes 100)))
  (send dc clear)
  (send dc set-brush (make-object color% 0 0 0) 'solid)
  (send dc draw-polygon (list (pt 2 0) (pt 2 4)
                              (pt 4 4) (pt 4 0)))
  (send dc set-bitmap #f)
  (send bm get-argb-pixels 0 0 5 5 bs)
  bs)

Thanks for the report!

 Thanks.  I had hoped to test your fix in my original application  
 context using the nightly build.  However, no built version has  
 emerged in the three nights since your put your fix into SVN.  Is  
 something broken?

 Yes - a server that controls the build process is being replaced. The
 server has many jobs, so it's taking a while. Hopefully the new server
 will be working soon.
