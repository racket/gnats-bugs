>Description:
	
Replace-all in Find window now generates internal error.

Enter (define foo 4) and try a replace-all from "foo" to "baz".

  <=: expected arg of type <number>; 
  given #<primitive:wx:media-edit%::get-end-position> 
  (type <primitive-closure>)

I think I can also get internal errors from replace and 
replace&search, but maybe not.

PR 72 is also about replace-all, but this is a different and more
serious problem.
