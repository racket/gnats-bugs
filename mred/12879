>Description:
for instance if i type in the name 'Racket' in Persian into the ide
it will be shown as
رکت --> like {'ر','ک','ت'} on my computer!
that's not correct! some letters are supposed to be sticked togather! but they are all kinda displayed sepperated!,does racket have any notion of Right to Left strings?

and thanks in advance for any help!
Racket is a lovely thing!;-) but that's a serious problem i think!
