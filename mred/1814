>Description:
apologies if this is already reported -- I didn't see it in the
archives.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. evaluate code:

(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400))
(make-object slider% "slider" 0 100 f void)
(send f show #t)

;; 2. click on rhs arrow thingy carefully
;;    sometimes the slider jumps by two instead
;;    of just one.
