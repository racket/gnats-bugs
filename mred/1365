>Description:
Currently, the macos launchers run a separate binary which causes problems
for the applications menu, icons, and apple events. If we could just make
mred and mzscheme be shared libraries and have the launchers actually
create little app stubs that link in the shared library, that would be much 
better.

We should also improve the launcher interface so people can specify their
own file creator and types and even a resource file (for icons and memory
allocation, etc).
