Mac PowerPC
>Description:
MrEd does not seem to keep up with a display depth change on the mac.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the display depth to lots of colors.
Start up DrScheme.
Change depth to 256 colors.
Some of the colors go funny.

In my case, the texts became black on black and the paren highlighting is
now black on blue. The buttons all look fine, tho.
