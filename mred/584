mac

>Description:

When zooming, the top 10 or 15 pixels are not taken by the zoomed
window. So, there is a little hole along the top of screen, where other
windows peek thru. Just to be sure, I tried the same thing in SimpleText,
and SimpleText fills that space with it's zoomed windows.

>How-To-Repeat:

Open a file in mred. Click on the zoom button.
