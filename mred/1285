>Description:
The frame background (on my mac, a pale gray) is 
blanked to white and not redrawn when the frame is
already at a minimum size and is resized to be
smaller.

This bug seems to be mac-only (doesn't happen under
UNIX) but I'd appreciate suggestions on its origin.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Execute the following code:
           
(define my-frame (make-object frame% "frame-title"))
(define my-canvas (make-object canvas% my-frame))
(define my-button (make-object button% "my button" my-frame (lambda (a b) 3)))
(send my-canvas min-width 300)
(send my-canvas min-height 300)

(send my-frame show #t)

2) with the frame already at its minimum size, use
the resize box to shrink the window further (say,
to 100x100).  The window is redrawn at the same
size, but the gray behind the button is not redrawn.

 I am surprised that you can even make it smaller than the initial size.
 It should pop back to the original size. Perhaps that is the real bug?

 No, no, you can't resize it.  It just gets redrawn without the right 
 background.
 I should have been clearer.
