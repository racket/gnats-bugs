 Are you going to provide a "install this thunk into the about box menu item
 and call it this string" procedure that works on the mac and windows and
 does something under X?

 I have now documented the special handling that is already built into
 MrEd. The following documentation appears in wx:menu-bar%'s append
 (and it's referenced in a few other places).
  
  If the menu is given the name "Help", it is treated specially on some
  platforms. Under X Windows, the "Help" menu is typically right-aligned
  in the menu bar. Under MacOS, if the name of the first item in the
  "Help" menu starts with "About", then the menu item is duplicated as
  the first item under the Apple menu.
 
 Nothing special is needed under Windows: there's no simple way to
 right-align menus in the menu bar, and there's no special menu item
 for About boxes.

 Is this new? Man, that's twice in recent memory I've missed a change to the
 engine that I need to pick up on in the system. Sorry about that.

 Except for the convention that Richard mentioned?
 
 Well, I think that I will add an installer that sets the name and the
 callback that vertain frames will pick up automatically.

 Ah. Nevermind "I have *now* documented..." I can read, really!
