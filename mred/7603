Student saved contents of definition window while in DrScheme.  The file was saved on a network drive.
When he tried to reopen the file, gets an error
insert-file in text%:
error loading the file

Do you know what would cause this error message?  Could it be related to using a box to comment out lines of code?

Thanks,
Charlotte

 You are using version 299.200, which had a bug in saving files.  This
 bug is fixed in version 299.400, so tell the students to upgrade to
 that and you will not have this problem.  Unfortunately there is no
 automatic way to recover the damaged file -- you can send it to me and
 I may recover some of the text.
