>Description:
Running the code below should produce a window with a "Menu", and clicking
the menu should do the printout.  On OS X PPC machines it doesn't.

This is the bug that leads to the problems with the language menu on PPC.
I'm submitting it so it doesn't get forgotten, and to CC John Chandler, since
he is eager for it to be fixed.  In addition, he said:

| (If the bug hasn't been fixed yet, and realizing that this may already
| be obvious, I'd point out that the symptom seems *not* to occur on
| Leopard, even on PPC, which might say something about what's
| involved.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require racket/gui)
(define f  (new frame% [label "Foo"] [width 200] [height 200]))
(define mb (new menu-bar% [parent f]))
(define cb (Î» _ (printf "Foo!\n")))
(define m (new menu% [parent mb] [label "Menu"] [demand-callback cb]))
(send f show #t)
