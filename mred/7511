 This was true for me until recently, but I'm pretty sure that I fixed
 it sometime around the 29.108 release. Double-checking, I see that
 DrScheme behaves correctly for me right now, and it works when I use
 the nightly build instead of my development build.
 
 Robby: Does the "Help Desk" menu work for you when no window is open,
 or does the app quit?
 
 Paul: If you clear out version 299.108 from
    ~/Library/Frameworks/PLT_*/Versions/
 and install the nightly build, do you still see the same behavior?

 Ok, just did so, down-loaded this morning's above files, replaced the ones
 in ~/Library/Frameworks/, ran ./install -i, then did as above:
 
 - DrScheme still silently quits?
 
 - and for the hell of it, checked window zoom-unexpand behavior, which still
   grows the height of a window every time it unexpands just as my local
   compiled version does, so it would seem to me an OSX version library
   version idiosyncrasy on my machine? (and if helpful, it grows past the
   bottom of the screen, so it would appear that a window being sized larger
   than the screen also isn't being caught?)

 And if you delete or move the PLT_MrEd files, then DrScheme and MrEd
 don't start, but MzScheme still does? What's the m5d result for
 PLT_MrEd.framework/Versions/299.108/PLT_MrEd ?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 The app quits for me, but I see a nwe `configure' so I'm re-building.

 I re-built and tried three times, two times I got Help Desk and one
 time it exited.

 - implying something's obviously not deterministic somewhere?

 Aha - I managed to get it to fail by trying multiple times in the same
 DrScheme run.
 
 Possibly fixed, now.
