>Description:
The insert method of mred:media-edit% is supposed to replace
a portion of text when called with start and end arguments.
This means that calling insert on an empty string should
effectively delete text.  However, this does not happen---
empty strings seem to get entirely ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
(let* ((frame (make-object mred:frame% null "Test"))
       (panel (make-object mred:vertical-panel% frame))
       (canvas (make-object mred:one-line-canvas% panel))
       (edit (make-object mred:return-edit% (lambda () #t))))
  (send frame show #t)
  (send canvas set-media edit)
  (send edit insert "Test")
  (send edit insert "" 0 (send edit last-position)))
