>Description:

The ellipse drawing in xor mode does not quite get the same pixels as it
does in solid mode. A sliver is left in the upper left.

>How-To-Repeat:

(define solid-pen (make-object pen% "BLACK" 1 'solid))
(define solid-brush (make-object brush% "BLACK" 'solid))
(define transparent-pen (make-object pen% "BLACK" 1 'transparent))
(define xor-brush (make-object brush% "BLACK" 'xor))

(define frame (make-object frame% "frame"))
(make-object (class canvas% ()
	       (inherit get-dc)
	       (override
		[on-paint
		 (lambda ()
		   (let ([dc (get-dc)])
		     (send dc set-pen solid-pen)
		     (send dc set-brush solid-brush)
		     (send dc draw-ellipse 10 10 80 80)

		     (send dc set-pen transparent-pen)
		     (send dc set-brush xor-brush)
		     (send dc draw-ellipse 10 10 80 80)))])
	       (inherit min-width min-height)
	       (sequence
		 (super-init frame)
		 (min-width 100)
		 (min-height 100))))

(send frame show #t)

 Your example actually shows that a brush doesn't cover the same ellipse
 area as a pen.

 Change the latter to xor and you do get white.
 
 It's unclear whether I can do anything about the brush-pen mismatch for
 now.
