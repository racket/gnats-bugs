>Description:
When the users types an existing file's name in the
platform-independent file-save dialog, it should show
a message box that says something like "really save over
the existing file?". Instead, there's an internal error:

  message-box: expects argument of type <list of style symbols>; given yes-no

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme in X (or without platform-specific file dialogs
  in Windows/MacOS)
Select File|Save
Type the name of an existing file
Click "Ok"
