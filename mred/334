>Description:
	I have a file that contains 
	(define paddle (vector wPADDLE0 ePADDLE0))

	(Define (in? sel)
	  (lambda (x)

        I cap'ed PADDLE0 in line 1, and voila` the following D went cap,
        too.

>How-To-Repeat:
	I can repeat it for this particular pair of lines as often as I
	want: lc PADDLE0 and the D and start over. 
	
	I cannot repeat it anywhere else.
