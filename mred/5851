>Description:
when a parented dialog pops up another parented dialog
the sheets look fine, but closing the second dialog
causes problems for other mred windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
The code below demonstrates the problem --
the `button2' and `close' buttons are
greyed out even after the second "sheet" closes.

But I think that there are still other problems
relating to eventspaces with this. I haven' ttried
to narrow it down, but drscheme itself gets
confused when you run the program below a few times.

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define b1 (make-object button% "button1" f (lambda (x y) (button1))))
(define (button1)
  (define d (make-object dialog% "dlg" f))
  (define b2 (make-object button% "button2" d (lambda (x y) (button2))))
  (define cb (make-object button% "close" d (lambda (x y) (send d show #f))))
  (define (button2)
    (message-box "a" "b" d))

  (send d show #t))
(send f show #t)
