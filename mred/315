>Description:
	The garbage collection icon turns off prematurely.
	Garbage collection for some resources requries actual os work,
	during the finalization. During this phase, the gc light is off.
>How-To-Repeat:
	have some garbage generating on-paint for a pasteboard and 
	make it run a lot (say drscheme ii's compound units or check
	sytax's arrows). You will see pauses in the drawing when the
	gc light is off.

State-Changed-Why:
After a long period of investigation, I've decided that it's best to
leave the GC icon off during finalization. Finalization should not
take a discernable amount of time, and the lack of a light has been a
good indicator of finalization going badly.
