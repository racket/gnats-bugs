>Description:
This error occurred on Windows Vista with DrScheme 4.1 english while trying to build an executable that uses the world.ss teachpack from a program in Intermediate Student with lambda custom:

copy-directory/files: encountered C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\mzlib\icons/file.gif, neither a file nor a directory

 === context ===
C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\compiler\distribute.ss:392:28: loop
C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\compiler\distribute.ss:368:4: loop
core
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrScheme 4.1 english on Windows Vista
2. Add the world.ss teachpack
3. Select Intermediate Student with lambda as the language
4. Run
5. Write a program
6. Make an executable
7. Find the error (or not)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:26 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
