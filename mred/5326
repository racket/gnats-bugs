see the visible portion of the editor change, but it shouldn't.

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

Some notes on the example:
 - es2 and es3 are not needed to demonstrate
   the problem
 - if you remove the explicit `scroll-to' call,
   then the canvas doesn't scroll to the insertion
   of the most recent esX, and it should

The problem is that scroll requests from an embedded editor
were half-way dropped when the embedding editor has an
edit sequence. The embedded editor didn't report the scroll
request, but it also didn't forget it. Later, when you click
on the clickback, the embedded would report "by the way,
please scroll to position X, because I forgot to ask a long
time ago".

The repair was to make sure that the scroll request is
reported. This means that more work is performed than
needed, since the scroll request is replaced by another
before the enclosing editor is displayed. In other words,
the repair weakens the already-weak effect of edit
sequences on embedded editors. This could cause
performance problems in code that was not otherwise
affected by the bug, but I think probably it won't.

A better solution would be to extend the editor protocol
to that the embedded editor can say "I have a scroll request;
if you ever become interested, send me back this information
and I'll turn it into a normal scroll request". Maybe one day.

 Great!
 
 Any chance this fix will help with the mysterious scrolling when a  
 file containing lots of embedded editors is opened?
