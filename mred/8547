>Description:
DrScheme crashes shortly after startup when using libx11 1.1. This is a known problem in Debian ([1], backtrace included) and Ubuntu [2] and has not been fixed in DrScheme 360. After starting DrScheme, clicking anywhere produces the following message and crashes the program:

mred: xcb_xlib.c:41: xcb_xlib_lock: Assertion `!c->xlib.lock' failed.

This is a known problem mentioned in [3] and indicates a bug in MrEd: XLockDisplay is being called on an already locked display. This bug has started causing problems with the release [4] of xlib 1.1, which uses XCB as a transport layer and triggers an assertion if a locked display is locked again (or an unlocked display is unlocked).

Some time with GDB indicates that the bug exists in src/mred/mredx.cxx, functions CheckPred and MrEdGetNextEvent.

The function MrEdGetNextEvent calls XCheckIfEvent with CheckPred as a predicate. "man XCheckIfEvent" says that
"Your predicate procedure must decide if the event is useful without calling any Xlib functions". However CheckPred calls XGetGeometry, violating this rule.

The assertion is triggered because XCheckIfEvent locks the display before calling CheckPred. CheckPred calls XGetGeometry, which attempts to lock the (already locked) display. The solution is to fix CheckPred to not call any Xlib functions.

 It appears that the Debian bug is a different problem, but caused by
 the same assertion in Xlib/XCB. There may be more than one place in
 the DrScheme code (or underlying libraries) where that assertion is
 being triggered.

 I think I have a fix for the next version.
 
 However, I'm not very good at installing different variations of Linux
 or its libraries. Any suggestions on how I can quickly arrive at a
 suitably configured Linux installation for testing?
 
 (I normally use Ubuntu Edgy in a Parallels VM.)
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I can let you access all of the build machines (in most of them I have
 a password that you know), but I don't know if any of them has a newer
 libx.  (Is there an easy (distro-independent) way to find out?)

 Check whether clicking in MrEd crashes. :)

 Running "ldd /usr/lib/libX11.so" should show mention "xcb" somewhere
 if it's a newer version.

 The problem is setting up the X redirection, and doing it on my
 office's screen instead of through VNC.
 
 Actually -- is this a problem of the X server or the client?  If it's
 the server, then all I have is my office machine (FC6) or Xvnc.

 I checked out the SVN trunk and I'm happy to say that the problem is
 indeed fixed. However, there are more locking errors in the CheckPred
 function. Now, MrEd starts up fine, but when you type something and
 then try to move the mouse, it crashes the program with the same
 assertion.
 
 I believe this happens in the code fragment which unhides the cursor
 on MotionNotify events:
     if (e->xbutton.time > lastUnhideTime) {
       lastUnhideTime = e->xbutton.time;
       wxUnhideAllCursors();
     }
 wxUnhideAllCursors ends up calling XtVaSetValues which eventually
 calls XDefineCursor, which tries to lock the screen. Here is the
 relevant backtrace excerpt:

 I should have caught that, and it should be fixed in SVN, now.

 Indeed, DrScheme is working very well now. I'll continue to use it and
 watch for further XCB-related problems. I'm only concerned about the
 backtrace on the Debian bug report
 [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=409197] which
 doesn't match any of the backtraces I got. I'm not entirely sure how
 that sequence of function calls can occur. Perhaps you could take a
 look at it and see if it might present a problem.
 
 Thanks for all your help

 That is puzzling. My best guess is that some compiler optimization has
 caused MrEdCheckForBreak to be substituted for CheckPred in the
 backtrace.
