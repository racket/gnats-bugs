>Description:
Checkable menu items toggle their (checked) value when selected using the mouse or using the alt keys, but not when using the specified shortcut key. The keymap that is built for the shortcut just calls the callback as opposed to actually selecting the menu-item. See mrmenu.ss line 308, (callback this (make-object wx:control-event% 'menu)), as opposed to wxmenu.ss line 71, (send menu select this). The former handles the shortcut character while the latter handles label shortcuts (accessed via alt keys). I think the call in mrmenu.ss should also be to the select method to ensure that any side effects of the selection (like toggling the check value) occur in addition to whatever is in the callback.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following shows the problem.

#lang scheme/gui

(define the-frame
  (instantiate frame%
    ("Test")
    (min-width 100)
    (min-height 100)))

(define the-menu-bar
  (instantiate menu-bar%
    (the-frame)))

(define the-test-menu
  (instantiate menu%
    ("&Test" the-menu-bar)))

(define the-checkable-menu-item
  (instantiate checkable-menu-item%
    ("&Check" the-test-menu)
    (callback
     (lambda (checkable-menu-item event)
       (printf "is-checked? = ~a~n"
               (send checkable-menu-item is-checked?))))
    (shortcut #\C)))

(send the-frame show #t)

If you select the checkable menu item using the mouse or alt keys (alt-T, alt-C), the value toggles correctly. If you access it with the shortcut (cntl-C) it doesn't toggle, although the callback is called.
The behavior is the same on Windows XP, Mac OS X, and Linux (Ubuntu AMD64).
