>Description:
When I saved my file, It took quite a bit of time to do some time to do so on this machine. I had time to move the drscheme window before the save process was completed. When I moved the window I got a drscheme internal error:

on-move in window<%>: expects argument of type <exact integer in [-10000, 10000]>; given 20103

The window disappeared. When I dismissed the error message-box the window reappeared where I had moved it to.
>How-To-Repeat:
I was able to recreate the problem by opening many drscheme windows and using them for some time. Doing this caused drscheme to run slowly after a while so that when I clicked save I would have enough time to move the window before it was done.
