>Description:

One cannot tell by looking at a list box if it has the focus, under Xt. (ie
there's no little black frame around it, like buttons and canvases have).

State-Changed-Why:

Fixed and released for sparc-solaris, i386-freebsd, and i386-linux.

When the focus is not on a list, the list looks a little weird because
the room for the hilite frame is only around the list items, not
including the scroll bar. Fixing this minor cosmetic detail is a lot
of work.
