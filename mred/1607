>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
1. start mred
2. click close box of repl window
-- mred should exit at this point, but it doesn't.
-- instead, it does the same thing it used to do
-- when there were no windows open, but mred was still
-- running (ie, respond very slowly to clicks and have
--          a funny menu bar that eventually changes
--          into one with a file|quit menu item)
