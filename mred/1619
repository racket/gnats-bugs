When I have created a new project I cannot add files to it.

This problem only exists with the Windows version of DrScheme, 
it works the way I expect it both with the MacOS and the Linux i386 version.

Is there anything special to consider when I use the Win version??

 Thanks for the bug report.
 
 This is a bug in the windows version of DrScheme -- it has been fixed 
 for the next release due out sometime next month.
 
 Sorry for the problem,
 Robby

 [As Robby says, we've fixed this bug for 103.]
 
 Meanwhile, the add-file dialog will likely work if you select multiple
 files to add at a time (as opposed to a single file).
 
 Thanks for the bug report,
 Matthew
