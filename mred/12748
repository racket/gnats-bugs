>Description:
Debian thinks it needs at least libjpg.so.62
but the program wants exactly libjpg.so.62 (v 6.2)

I have libjpg.so.8 (version 8) and I just made a
ln -s libjpg.so.8 libjpg.so.62

It seems to be working OK :)

Newbies will have trouble with this because
apt-get is supposed to "just work".

Reason>>> This was fixed two months ago -- by the Debian packager...  It will be
included in the next release.
