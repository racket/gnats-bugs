>Description:
creating a modal dialog and having no button callback that
does a show #f can wedge entire mred (presumably just the eventspace
but I didn't check that)

The file|close menu doesn't work.

The only way to get out of mred is to forcibly kill the application,
which can lose lots of work :(

 There are many ways to wedge MrEd; that's why it's being deprecated in
 favor of DrScheme with the MrEd vocabulary.
 
 But, unless you override on-close, file|close should work. Just to
 double-check, file|close doesn't work for this dialog, right?:
   (send (make-object mred:dialog-box% null "hi" #t) show #t)

 Apologies for not including example code. This code you sent suffices to
 show the problem:
 
  (send (make-object mred:dialog-box% null "hi" #t) show #t)
