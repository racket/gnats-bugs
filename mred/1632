>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. evaluate program below
;; 2. hit spacebar (clicks the button)
;; 3. window re-appears, but without
;;    drawing the dotted line that indicates
;;    the button is focused.
;;    (The space bar still seems to work, tho)

(define dialog (make-object dialog% "dialog"))

(define (f)
  (let* ([button
	  (make-object button% "button" dialog
		       (lambda x
			 (send dialog show #f)))])
    (send button focus)
    (send dialog show #t)))

(f)
(send dialog change-children (lambda (l) null))
(f)

State-Changed-Why:

Fixed serious half of the problem: in the above example,
the *old* button is still given the focus by Windows.(I think
this is a Windows bug, but nevermind.

I can't find a way to get Windows to not restore the focus on the old
button.
