>Description:
Currently I can embed native widgets into a racket gui program by extracting out the native object and manipulating it with the native APIs. But If I want to create a racket widget I need to extend from any of the existing subclasses, but this does not work if there is not something comparable to subclass from. Currently there is no public racket windowing class that corresponds to a subwindow<%> without any other features, thus I cannot make exactly what I want. Currently my workaround is to use a panel%, but this leads to the problem that my widget should not have subwindows, but the API says it should be able to support them.
