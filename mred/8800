>Description:
The only way I can navigate my filesystem in this dialog is to type names in the "Filename" field.  Happily, completion works there.
>How-To-Repeat:
I started DrScheme
From the "File" menu, I chose "Open..."
In the "Open File" dialog that appeared, I double-clicked one of the directory names that was shown in the large scrollable area.

 I tried several builds, and reduced this problem to the change in
 revision 6563 (which says something about container sequences).

 Ah, that was a big clue -- thanks!
 
 This should be fixed in SVN, now, as well as the problem with the Help
 Desk "Rewind" button.
 
 The change in revision 6563 caused controls to be created more
 frequently in an initially-invisible state. Internally, that created an
 Xt widget that is not only unmanaged, but unrealized. Since the widget
 was unrealized, something went wrong in installing the event
 translations. (I don't really understand why, but it seems to be
 related to extra event callbacks installed outside the widget. Also,
 the dialog always worked for me the second time, which suggests some
 timing-of-callbacks interaction.) An initially unmanaged widget is now
 at least realized.
