>Description:
I can hi-lite, copy and paste from DrScheme to DrScheme, but trying to use the copied text and pasting
to Notepad does not work.  'Paste' is grayed out in Notepad.  However, I can copy from Notepad into DrScheme.
FWIW, I can paste into MS Word, but not other text editors like Notepad Light, CONtext, Crimson Editor, etc.

I am using Windows 98, first edition and using latest version of DrScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type something, hi-lite, copy, and the try to paste in Notepad.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:18 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
