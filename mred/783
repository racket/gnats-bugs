>Description:
according to the docs, get-view-start is the replacement for
view-start. Also, the error message is buggy. Instead of saying
"class canvas%" it says "class derived from canvas%". See below.

Also, there is some other strange behavior going on. The
method "get-view-start" is allowed in inherit clauses, but
not allowed at runtime when it is looked up. See below for
the transcript.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (send (make-object canvas% (make-object frame% "test")) view-start)
ivar: instance variable not found: view-start in class: canvas%

> (send (make-object canvas% (make-object frame% "test")) get-view-start)
ivar: instance variable not found: get-view-start in class: derived from canvas%

> (class canvas% args (inherit get-view-start))
#<class>

In 100/5, get-view-start works, but it returns the offset in pixels,
rather than scrollbar steps.
