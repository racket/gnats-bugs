>Description:
I have overridden on-new-string-snip, but it isn't always used.

the code below produces lots of #f and one #t and I
expected only #ts.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module m mzscheme
  (require (lib "class.ss")
           (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))

  (define 1-text%
    (class text%
      (define/override (on-new-string-snip)
        (instantiate 1-pixel-string-snip% ()))
      (super-instantiate ())))
  
  (define 1-pixel-string-snip%
    (class string-snip%
      (init-rest args)
      (apply super-make-object args)))
  
  (define t (make-object 1-text%))

  (send t insert "abcdef\n\nghijklm")
  (define snips
    (let loop ([s (send t find-first-snip)])
      (cond
        [(not s) null]
        [else (cons s (loop (send s next)))])))

  (display (map (lambda (x) (is-a? x 1-pixel-string-snip%)) snips)))

 You need to override `split-snip'; that's where the string-snip%
 instances are coming from.

 Further information: this seems to be a problem with snips splitting.

 perhaps the docs somewhere should be updated to clairify when
 on-new-string-snip is called.
