>Description:
If the expression hilighted in gray by the balanced-paren
shader is very large and the buffer is scrolled near the end
of that region, a portion of the shading is missing. 

The problem almost certainly occurs because the code that 
draws the shade tries to draw a ractangle with a height
greater than 32K pixels. The solution is to only draw
the portion of the rectangle that is visible. (Probably the
shading is part of a buffer's on-paint method, in which case
the visible rectangle of the buffer is passed via bounding
box arguments.)

The documentation will be revised to clarify the size
restrictions on drawing. Eliminiating the restriction would
be really hard.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start mred
Turn on "Hilight between matching parens"
Open plt/collects/guibuilder/gbr.ss
Put the caret at the last paren of the file
Wait for the last line to turn gray; all the
 preceding lines should be gray, too, but they
 aren't
