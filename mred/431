>Originator:     Todd Hartley
>Release:        Version 50
>Organization:
titan
>Environment:
MS Windows 95
>Description:
Slowly Dr. Scheme steals Windows 95 resources until it (and other
programs) can't run, or the system becomes unstable.
I believe this has to do with the GUI routines for highlighting selected
text.
>How-To-Repeat:
[1] Open up some type of resource meter program (I used the default one
that came with Windows 95).

[2] Move the cursor to end of some expression with parans this should
automatically highlight the paran area.
IE: (car&cdr (s (cdr slst) errvalue))

[3a] Via keyboard, hold shift down, hit the "HOME" key, press the down
arrow key, and then hit the "END" key.  If the resource meter doesn't
decrease then repeat a few more times.  I would lose 1% every 2 or 3 times
I did this.

[3b] Via a mouse, hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse up
a spaces and down a few spaces.  Same as above, if the meter doesn't
decrease then repeat this few more times.

State-Changed-Why:

Whatever it was, it was fixed sometime during the development of
51. It was easy to reproduce the problem in 50, and it's not there in
51 (which will be released in a few weeks). That it's already fixed is
not surprising since I've done a lot of work on the graphics subsystem
in 51.
