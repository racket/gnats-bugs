I have defined in the Preferences the -adobe-courier font; 
on the screen, it is right and the french letters (é à è ...) are well
displayed.

But, on printing, a non fixed width font is used instead of the requested
one and I loose my french letters.

 I thought that this might be the problem that we fixed before where 
 the printer font was not the same as the displayed font, but we had 
 released that change in 101, so I don't know the story here.
 
 Do you plan to look at this PR?

 Hi,
 
 We have fixed this problem in the next release, version 102. It will
 likely be released in about a month.
 
 Thanks for the problem report,
 Matthew
