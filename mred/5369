>Description:
It's not possible to use the "move forward one s-expression" (M-C-f) to
extend the selection while in auto-select mode.

Of course M-C-SPACE works, but it would be nice if M-C-f/b/u/d worked
in conjunction with the auto-select feature.

It would also be nice to have a "I made a mistake, stop auto-selecting"
keyboard shortcut (of course, I can currently use M-C-f to do that, but
then the cursor doesn't end up where I want it to be - thinking about it,
I think I would want the cursor to then be where the selection was
started...)

 Does meta-space not do what you want in that case? If not, can you
 explain more precisely what you want?

 Meta-space ? Meta-space doesn't seem to do anything when I'm in
 auto-select mode. I can use it and nothing happens and I'm still in
 auto-select mode afterwards.
 
 What I want is a keyboard shortcut that, when used while in
 auto-select mode, will deselect what's currently selected, move the
 cursor back where the selection stared (idealy) and switch back into
 normal mode. I.e. have the same effect as if I were clicking with
 the mouse at the position where the auto-selecting started.

 Sorry, control-space. It should turn off auto-select mode when you are
 in auto-select mode.

 Here's the sequence for you:
 
   control-space ... some stuff... oops, I want to start over!
   control-space, left arrow (or maybe right arrow, depending if you
      were selecting backwards or forwards)

 Matthew, is this something that I can do? Right now, the keystroke just
 calls set-position.

 The auto-select feature is called "anchor"ing in the docs; `get-anchor'
 tells you whether anchoring is on, and `set-anchor' turns it on or off.
 
 Missing in the docs: the `move-position' method is affected by the
 anchor setting.
 
 One way to make things work would be to use `move-position' instead of
 `set-position', but you'd have to do a bunch of `move-position's in a
 loop to move 'right or 'left. (Note: to move the left end of the
 selection N items, you might need more than N moves, because the first
 few might "unmove" the right end of the selection.)
 
 So, all things considered, we probably want a new method that is like
 `move-position', except that takes a specific position like
 `set-position'. I'll look into it.
