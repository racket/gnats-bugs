>Description:
Background: I'm in the habit of starting drscheme from the
command line. This morning, I got my laptop up to speed on
DrS by updating source and collection trees, and did a 
clean compile.  However, now when I start drscheme from 
the command-line, DrScheme seems to be flying below the OS
radar.  In particular, I get the wizard window, but it's
not in the foreground.  Clicking on it does not bring it
to the foreground, and no MrEd/DrScheme icon appears in 
the dock.  Clicking on the "next" button is possible, and
DrScheme finishes starting up.  After startup, DrScheme
opens a nice big window; but again, it's in the background,
with no way to bring it forward, short of closing or moving
everything in front of it.  It still doesn't appear in the
list of applications in the dock.  It shows up fine in
'top', and I can kill it that way.

I should note that I had no such problem starting DrS on
my office desktop machine yesterday, and both machines 
are running 10.2.  On the other hand, it's been quite a
while since I updated the binaries on that machine.  

Has the MrEd or DrScheme startup code changed recently? 
>How-To-Repeat:
start up drscheme from the 'drscheme' shell script under
OS X 10.2

 Is plt/bin/mred a script or a link?
