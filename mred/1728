>Description:
The window radio-box% label is positioned nicely above the choices
in a vertical radio-box%. In macos adn windows, the label is
placed to the left of the choice box, which is far uglier, esp.
in the context of the language dialog -- imagine a label on the
radio box that appears when you choose the full-scheme variant.

It would be better if the radio-box label on macos and X windows
looked something closer to the way it looks under windows.

 For the record, this is also an issue with list-boxes. And I agree with you.
