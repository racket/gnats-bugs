>Description:
on-event mouseover handlers, such as the one which Check Syntax uses to detect which symbol the mouse is over, stop detecting mouse movement when the scroll wheel is used, and start working again only when one of the first three buttons is clicked.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open any Scheme file and activate Check Syntax. Verify that whenever you mouse over a symbol with known bindings, they're displayed. Use the scroll wheel to scroll up or down in that document. Moving the mouse to a new symbol will no longer change the display. Clicking with one of the first three buttons should restore the behavior to normal.

 This reminded me of an old PR I submitted a while ago -- it's PR6691,
 which is probably the same problem.  While I was looking for that, I
 also saw PR5938 (which Robby marked as his) which is definitely the
 same.

 Heh, sorry for not checking. I've gotten so used to finding unique
 bugs that I didn't  bother to look...

 I think I marked that back as mine in order to make a good test case
 for it. (I would do it right now, but I seem to be out of batteries for
 my scroll-wheel mouse ..)
