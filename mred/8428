Selecting "File" "Open" from the main menu

The given list of directories is from my Home-Directory. Possibly too many folders for the listbox. Opening of documents via Shell-commandline is possible, so the bug is somewhere in the get-file-dialog.

 Do you have any filenames that are longer than 200 characters?  How
 many files+directories do you have?  If you don't mind, can you do
 this in Scheme
 
   (map (lambda (p)
          (list (path->string p)
                (link-exists? p)
                (file-exists? p)
                (directory-exists? p)))
        (directory-list))
 
 and send me the result?  (Maybe change some of the strings if there's
 some confidential stuff you don't want to pass along.)
 
 Using this I can try to replicate that problem and hopefully solve it.

 Raising the limit is not a good solution...  Instead, I'll see if I
 can make the GUI truncate really long names and show that instead.  (I
 don't think that will be a problem to do that -- it doesn't sound
 likely that people will use such long names with the last few
 characters identifying the files.)
 
 
 BTW, are you sure that it was a link?  This --

 looks like MzScheme thinks that it's not a link.

 Fixed, finally.  Thanks again.
