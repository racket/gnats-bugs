>Description:
When a frame% is moved *manually* and not by its move method, on Linux get-x and get-y return the original position instead of the actual position of the window. Moreover, the on-move method is not called when the frame% is moved manually. (Calling reflow-container before get-x or get-y has no effect either.)

Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 with Gnome 2.

Workaround: none, since on-move is never called when the window is moved manually
>How-To-Repeat:
; Run:
#lang racket/gui
(define a (new frame% (label "test")(width 200)(height 200)))
(send a show #t)
(send a get-x)
(send a get-y)

; Now *manually* move the window somewhere else and evaluate again:

(send a get-x)
(send a get-y)

; ==> The methods return the same position values as previously.
