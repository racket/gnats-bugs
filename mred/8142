>Description:
I have not figured out how I caused this to happen, but here's the symptom: When the mouse pointer is in the main window, it simply doesn't show up. Widgets to react to mouse-clicks, though (I randomly moved it around and clicked, and saw things happen).

Interestingly, in newly-created windows (e.g., a new main window or dialogs such as Find or the Bug Reporter), the pointer does appear.
>How-To-Repeat:
Haven't figured out yet how to reproduce. Will keep you posted if I get this to happen again. I imagine, though, that this is a Linux-specific problem.

 The mouse is intentionally hidden when you type stuff, but it should
 re-appear when you moce the mouse.  So it would really be helpful if
 you can find the way to make it disappear for ever.  (For small values
 of "ever"...)

 Haven't been completely successful, but this just happened to me again in
 conjunction with pasting the X clipboard: I highlighted something in Emacs,
 and by accident tried to use DrScheme's paste (ctrl+v), which of course
 pasted the wrong thing. I immediately then middle-clicked, which pasted the
 emacs kill ring. At this point my mouse pointer was permanently gone.
 Problem is I tried this again since and it hasn't happened again.

 This is mred-level stuff. I think it gets hid when typing happens and
 is shown when the mouse moves (at least it is supposed to be that way).
 
 I'll move the pr.

 So far it has happened a few more times on two machines, both 1Mhz-1.2Mhz,
 512Mb PCs running Ubuntu Dapper, but never after a repeatable sequence of
 events. In all cases, though, this was while typing in the definitions
 window, and the machine was overloaded (i.e., much thrashing). Maybe it's
 some race condition where the cursor is intentionally hidden due to some
 typing, and a subsequent mouse move event, which should make it show up
 again, is "lost". Of course, I could go on speculating like this all day..

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:46:57 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
