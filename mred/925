 Matt,
 
 	Did you have a previous version installed?  If so,
 try uninstalling it, and reinstalling 53.

 Last time I saw these symptoms, the problem was a corrupted win.ini
 file. MrEd and DrScheme try to read win.ini on startup, even though
 win.ini is deprecated. (Like most other Windows programs, MzScheme and
 DrScheme Jr do not read win.ini.) The next release of MrEd/DrScheme
 will ignore win.ini.
 
 Try moving win.ini out of the system folder, and then see if DrScheme
 starts up.
