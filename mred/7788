>Description:
In order to get DrScheme v300 / Xft / Freetype to work under Ubuntu Breezy 5.10, I had to hand compile DrScheme from sources. Since I'm a developer, thats OK - and under Gentoo, this is typically a breeze because Gentoo is source based and usually everyting is just "there".

However, Ubuntu is a binary based distro, and I had to make sure I had all the 'devel' or 'dev' packages installed. Following in the instructions, I made sure I hade the headers/libs for stated dependent libs: FreeType, Cairo, Xft, and X.

after a "./configure " everything seemed to go well. However, after "make" , compilation failed a number of times until I installed the appropriate -devel package - one surprising one was 'xbitmaps'.

The autoconf scripts should probably check the environment more thoroughly so that errors are reported before the build.
>How-To-Repeat:
On Ubuntu Breezy 5.10 with freetype, xft, X, Cairo devel packages installed:

./configure && make
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 23 Feb 2006 15:22:26 -0500
Reason>>> I've improved the configure script to detect
missing libraries. (I used a fresh Breezy install
to check it.) The xbitmaps headers are no longer
needed.
