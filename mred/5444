>Description:
The set-modified method of the outer editor is not
called when an embedded editor changes, even tho
saving the file would result in a different file.

The on-change method is being called, however.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. run the code below
;; 2. save the editor
;; 3. put the focus to the
;;    embedded editor.
;; 4. type
;; don't see the set modified method being called.

(define t%
  (class text%
    (rename [super-set-modified set-modified])
    (define/override (set-modified x)
      (printf "set-modified: ~s\n" x)
      (super-set-modified x))
    (define/override (on-change)
      (printf "on-change\n"))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define t (make-object t%))
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 300 300))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send t insert (make-object editor-snip% (make-object text%)))
(define b (instantiate button% ()
            (label "save")
            (parent f)
            (callback (lambda (x y) (send t save-file)))))
(send f show #t)
