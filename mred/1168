The documentation for the auto-wrap preference says:

Changing this preference affects new windows only.

However, this is true only for non-framework editors.
text:basic-mixin installs a callback which calls auto-wrap
upon every change.  Worse, it even does this when auto-wrap
has been changed from outside the preference mechanism.

I do think the software should be fixed rather than the
documentation.

 Sorry! I "fixed" the preference to work for already opened frames and
 did not update the documentation.
 
 I will fix the software again so that the text autowrapping is in a
 separate mixin, which can be elided to get something like the old
 behavior. Would that be satisfactory?
