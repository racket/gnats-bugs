DrScheme sets the title bar title to the empty string when opening the second tabs, and leaves it empty succequently.


KDE has this to say about title bar titles:

"
The application window should be labelled with the name of the document in the window, and the application name, separated by a hyphen. For example, "www.kde.org - Konqueror", "StyleGuide.ps - KGhostView", or "(untitled) - KEdit".
"
http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/basics/windows.html



And gnome says this:
"
Use Filename as the window title for document-based applications. Do not use the full pathname, as the filename alone is easier to distinguish amongst other open window titles, for example on the window list.

Example 3.1. Using document names as window titles
Application	Example window title
AbiWord	My Report.abw
Evolution	Inbox
Music player	U2 - Better Than the Real Thing

If the pathname is important, for example the user has opened two documents with the same name from different directories in the same application, show the full pathname in the statusbar.

Before a new document has been saved for the first time, set the window title to Unsaved <document type>. For example, Unsaved Drawing, Unsaved Spreadsheet, or the more generic Unsaved Document.

When a document has pending changes, insert an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the window title. For example, *Unsaved Drawing, *AnnualReport.

For non-document-based applications, use Application Name as the window title.

 This is not the behavior I see under mac os x.
 
 Is this a mred-level issue?

 This is a MrEd problem, and it's a duplicate of PR7276.  I thought
 that the problem was sawfish-specific, so I closed it, but recently
 learned that the bug is in MrEd.
 
 You will see this bug if you run this code, which will pop-up a
 window, and after two seconds the title will become blank instead of
 turning to "Bar":
 
   (define f (new frame% [label "Foo"] [min-width 200] [min-height 200]))
   (send f show #t)
   (sleep/yield 2)
   (send f set-label "Bar")
   (sleep/yield 2)
 
 (I revived the other PR and will mark this as a duplicate)
