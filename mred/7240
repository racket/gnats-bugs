>Description:
I'm using the latest Xorg version and i can't get any text on the GUI interface. I've read on several forums that everyone who has the same problem uses Xorg. It looks like the GUI interface tries to use a font that's not in Xorg.
>How-To-Repeat:
just try to use it in Xorg no matter what version, tried it with version 205 and 209.

 For the record, I'm using Fedora Core which uses Xorg, and there is no
 problem at all.

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
