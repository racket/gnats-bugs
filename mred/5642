>Description:
I am using Lite Switch to alt-tab among applications. 
When I switch from IE to Terminal, and each of them 
has 2 or more frames open, all the frames associated 
with the app come up. When I do the same for MrEd frames, 
only one of the frames of a MrEd application comes up. 
This is particularly annoying for SirMail.
