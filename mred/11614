>Description:
Under Windows, printing out sourcecode from the racket editor leads to a printout with a much bigger font-size than using in the editor.
If the printout should be one page in editor-font-size (due to 5.0.2), Racket prints only one page and cuts the remaining code, altough there should be a second page due to the bigger font.
>How-To-Repeat:
Print out a Racket-File
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Thu, 13 Jan 2011 22:16:03 -0500
Reason>>> The font-size problem should be fixed with the latest
code. Previously, the printing context was set up to make 
one drawing unit equal one point, but the font subsystem
used the screen resolution to scale font sizes to drawing
units; the usual DPI for Windows is 96, so text was 96/72
times as big as it should have been. The repair was to
set up a printing drawing context so that one drawing
unit matches the resolution claimed by the screen.

This change would not address the problem of getting
only one page where multiple pages are expected,
however, and I could not replicate that problem. Was
the cut-off part on the right (i.e., the line should
have wrapped) or at the bottom (i.e., the next page
should have continued with leftover lines)?

 Yep, the size is fine now.

 Both... I made pdf-printouts from an example in 5.0.2 and 5.0.99.6:
 http://www.dobretzberger.de/printing-5.0.2.pdf
 http://www.dobretzberger.de/printing-5.0.99.6.pdf
 
 And one more thing I noticed, don't know if it matters:
 The printing-dialogue has different appearance between 5.0.2 and 5.0.99.6:

 Does that fix the problem of text being dropped off the right and
 bottom of the page?
 
 I'll have to investigate further about the dialog difference.

 It seems that doesn't take effect on my system.
 
 And one more thing I discovered:
 When line numbers are shown in the editor, the printout is much more =
 cropped:

 I've corrected the printing dialog style, but I'm still stumped by the
 page-size problem.
 
 Did you generate the mis-formatted PDFs using the HP 6940 driver that
 shows up in your screen shots?

 I generated the PDFs with the Adobe PDF Printer and "real" printouts =
 with the HP 6940.

 I've pushed another fix that may resolve the problem with printing
 beyond the page size.

 Without line-numbers on, the fix doesn't change anything for printing =
 here and with line-numbers on,
 now DrRacket crashes with following message: =

 I only want to remind you, that the problem is not still fixed yet.
 It's a little bit annoying, because some of my students are not 
 able to print out their sources via DrRacket.
 
 We found out another strange behaviour, maybe concerned with the "only-one-page-printing"-problem:
 If you change the margins for printing via "File->Page Setup" (the values doesn't matter), you get a blank page on printing.
 
 That all happens reproducible at least on Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 with DrRacket 5.1.x.
