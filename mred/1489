 This is intentional, and imitates Motif, although I agree that it's not
 ideal:
 
   * The black border moved by Tab corresponds to the space bar.
 
   * The chiseled border corresponds to Return.
 
 The usual whimpering disclaimer applies: if it was at all easy to
 change, I'd have done it already.
