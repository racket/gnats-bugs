>Description:
The docs say that the choice's parameter to a radio box can be: "list of strings or bitmap% objects". I agree that this is not precise (whatever
happened to using Spidey's type language?) but the best guess I have is:

  (list-of (union string (instance bitmap%))

This is the wrong guess:

  > (make-object radio-box% "" (list "a" "a" (make-object bitmap% "")) (make-object frame% "frame") void)
  initialization for radio-box%: expects argument of type <non-empty list of strings or bitmap% objects>; given ("a" "a" #<object:bitmap%>)

(Note that the error message has the same problem)

So, I guess that the acutal type accepted is:

  (union (list-of string) (list-of (instance bitmap%)))
