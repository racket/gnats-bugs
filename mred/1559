>Description:
When the 'anchored flag is set on an editor-snip%, in fact it 
is not anchored and can be resized and dragged about the pasteboard.

The text-editor-snip's get-flags method returns '(anchored), as expected, 
but the snip's behavior isn't anchored.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "frame" #f 800 800))
(define text (make-object text%))
(send text set-styles-sticky #f)
(send text auto-wrap #t)
(define editor-canvas (make-object editor-canvas% frame text))
(define pb (make-object pasteboard%))
(define pb-snip (make-object editor-snip% pb #t 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 500 500 500 500))
(send text insert pb-snip)

(define text-editor (make-object text%))
(define text-editor-snip (make-object editor-snip% text-editor #t 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 200 200 200 200))
(send text-editor-snip set-flags '(anchored))
(send pb insert text-editor-snip)

 'anchored seems not to be implemented at all. It doesn't look familiar
 to me, so it must be an old idea that never got implemented (and then I
 forgot about it).
 
 You should be able to implement the desired behavior by overriding
 `can-move-to?' in the pasteboard, instead.
 
 I'll plan to remove 'anchored for version 103.
