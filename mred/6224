>Description:
Sending the delete method to a tab-panel% with an index <> 0 results in incorrect behaviour: the tab is not removed and often extra tabs appear.  This in DrScheme 202.3-cvs18sep2002
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
         (lib "class.ss"))

(define top-frame 
  (instantiate frame% () (label "Tabbed Panel Test")))

(define tabbed-panel
  (instantiate tab-panel% () (parent top-frame) (choices '()) (callback (lambda foo (void)))))

(send top-frame show #t)

(for-each (lambda (name) 
           (send tabbed-panel append name))
          (list "foo" "bar" "quux"))

(send tabbed-panel delete 2)
(send tabbed-panel delete 1)

should show a window with one tab "foo".  Instead shows a windows with four tabs (!!) : "foo", "foo", "bar" & "quux"
