>Description:
When the code below is evaluated, the displkay of the snips is all messed up.
Not only does the embedded pasteboards not appear below the text snips,
but they outer ones doesn't even appear to be big enough for just the
inner pasteboards (ie, the pasetboards look bigger when the code in
pr 995 is evaluated)
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "frame"))

(define pb (make-object pasteboard%))
(define editor-canvas (make-object editor-canvas% frame pb))

(let loop ([n 10]
	   [pb pb])
  (unless (zero? n)
    (let ([new-pb (make-object pasteboard%)]
	  [ts (make-object string-snip% 3)])
      (send ts insert "aaa" 3)
      (send pb insert ts)
      (let ([b1 (box 0)]
	    [b2 (box 0)])
	(send pb get-snip-location ts #f b1 #f)
	(send pb get-snip-location ts #f b2 #t)
	(send pb insert (make-object editor-snip% new-pb) 0 
	      (+ (- (unbox b1) (unbox b2)) 3)))
      (loop (- n 1)
	    new-pb))))

(send frame show #t)

State-Changed-Why:

Same update/resizing bug as PR 995. The boxes don't appear below the
text because the text's bottom location is subtracted from the top,
instead of the other way around.
