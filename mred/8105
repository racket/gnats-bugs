 I did something to try to fix it, but not sure.
 
 Matthew -- this exception happened in the following code:
 
       ;; Use the path-list for completion options
       (define saved-path-list-state #f)
       (define (save-path-list-state)
         (unless saved-path-list-state
           (set! saved-path-list-state
                 (list (send path-list get-first-visible-item)
                       (send path-list get-selections)))))
       (define (restore-path-list-state)
         (when saved-path-list-state
           (send path-list set paths)
           (for-each (lambda (i) (send path-list select i))
                     (cadr saved-path-list-state))
           (send path-list set-first-visible-item (car saved-path-list-state))
           (set! saved-path-list-state #f)))
 
 and this is the only code that touches `saved-path-list-state'.  If it
 is invoked from the GUI, can it happen that it gets in a race
 condition?  I thought that GUI messages are handled one by one...
 
 (And the fix that I'm not sure about is to serialize the two functions
 above using a semaphore.)

 Right - there's no threading in your dialog code. The semaphore is
 useless.
 
 I can get this result by 
 
  1. Going to ~/
 
  2. Checking the box to show "." files
 
  3. Selecting the last file in the list
 
  4. Typing "D", which matches only "Desktop".
 
  5. Unchecking the box to show "." files
 
  6. Deleting the "D"
 
 This is the first thing I tried, so my guess is that there are other
 ways to make the list-of-files state change across the save and restore
 of the selection.

 OK, removed.

 (Actually, if it matches only "Desktop" then there is no problem,
 since the path-list is filtered only when there is more than a unique
 match.)

 It all goes through a single function so it was easy to fix.  I'll
 close the PR now.
