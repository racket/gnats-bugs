>Description:
See the comment at the top of the "steps to reproduce" program.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; This program demonstrates a bug in drawing monochrome bitmaps to printer drawing contexts.
;; Color bitmaps are not affected, even if they only contain black and white.
;; This bug has been verified using DrScheme version 4.2.2 (Pretty Big language).
;;
;; The program, when run under Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows, should produce two printous,
;; each of which should contain a diagonal line from the upper-left corner down to (200,200).
;; Both are produced by drawing the line on a 200 x 200 bitmap and then drawing the bitmap to
;; the printer.  The difference is one uses a monochrome bitmap, the other a color bitmap.
;;
;; The actual behavior depends on the operating system platform, the type of printer used,
;; and even the specific printer driver used.
;;
;; In all circumstances, the second printout, done with monochrome being #f, comes out fine.
;; But the first printout, done with a monochrome bitmap, produces the following results:
;;
;; (1) Under Mac OS 10.5, when the printer is an HP LaserJet 4050, only the upper-left pixel
;;     is printed -- the printout is almost entirely white.  (Other monochrome bitmaps have
;;     had other pixels printed, but always there are many missing pixels.)
;;
;; (2) Under Mac OS 10.5, when the printer is an HP Color LaserJet 2600n, the printout is fine.
;;
;; (3) Under Mac OS 10.5, when the print panel is used to save a PDF file, that PDF file
;;      previews fine, but when printed on the monochrome LaserJet behaves as in (1). If
;;      the PDF file is saved from Preview as a PNG, that prints fine.
;;
;; (4) Under Windows XP, the HP LaserJet 4050 with the PS driver prints a 200 x 200 solid
;;      black square in place of the bitmap.
;;
;; (5) Under Windows XP, the HP LaserJet 4050 with the PCL driver prints fine.
;;
;; (6) Under Windows XP, the HP Color LaserJet 2600n prints fine.
