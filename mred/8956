>Description:
For my Adelphi students, on classroom, campus, laptop, and desktop computers, DrScheme v37x sometimes closes when someone does each of the following (whether on Mac, Desktop, Laptop, campus, or home computer):
1) Clicking Run
2) Pressing Backspace or Enter
3) Going to Internet Explorer (i.e. to get a picture). (DrScheme either disappears when they click on IE, when they click back on DrScheme, or neither.)

 Hm. I don't suppose there is any more specific information you can provide?
 
 Is it possible they are running out of memory? Perhaps you might try
 with the memory limit enabled?

 Under the "Scheme" menu is a menu item called "Limit Memory". I'd try
 something like 128 megs, on a 2 gig machine, at least for use in
 lecture.
 
 Your drscheme should kill the user program if it runs out of memory.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:06 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
