 This bug has been fixed. Due to the popularity of the Windows version
 of DrScheme and the seriousness of this bug, we have decided to
 re-release version "50" of DrScheme for Windows with the bug fixed.
 
 The Windows distribution archive on the web page has been updated. The
 only change in the plt.exe archive is a new mred.exe.
