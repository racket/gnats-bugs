Human Language: english
>Description:
JP Roy notices that DrScheme does not respect the OS-level
(human) language preference. This manifests itself in two
ways: 
1) DrScheme maintains a separate preference for this
(cross-platform issues probably make this still the right
way to go)
2) DrScheme does not avail itself of automatic translation
in the apple and the "DrScheme" Menu.

I'm guessing the second one is easy to fix; there's 
probably a "SetMenuLanguagePreference" call or something
like that.  OTOH, maybe this is a problem with all carbon
apps.

Problem number 1) admits a variety of solutions; one
possibility would be to check on startup whether the OS
language preference matches the DrS language preference...
of course, this would probably mean widening the MrEd
interface in a non-platform-independent way.  Another
possibility would be to just leave it alone.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open the "International" control panel
2) Drag the word "Francais" up to the top of the 
  preference list.
3) Start an application (say, the Terminal).  See that
The Apple and Terminal menus are in that silly frenchy 
language.
4) Start DrScheme. See that The Apple and DrScheme menus
are still in English (problem 2) See that the rest of
the menus are still in English (problem 1).

5) quick! back out of all changes before all your system 
error messages are in French.
