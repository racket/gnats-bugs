>Description:
I had two files open in DrScheme, a saved definitions window and a
saved interactions window, both of which had been emailed to me by
a student.  After scrolling down part of the way in one window, I
tried to scroll farther down by moving the "thumb" in the scroll bar.
The "thumb" moved, exactly as I would expect, but there was no
change to the window contents; ditto with scrolling up.  I switched
to another app and back; no change.  I tried quitting DrScheme with
the pretzel-Q key combination; no response.  DrScheme menus were
dead, as was the "close" dot in the window.  I brought the other
file window to the front, and got an infinite flicker where the two
windows overlapped, as though each was trying to move to the front
many times per second.  A "force quit" solved the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
It hasn't happened again, even with the same files open and the same
other programs running, so I have no idea how to reproduce it.
But I thought my description might be helpful if you hear of another
similar bug.

 Thanks for the detailed bug report. I'm pretty sure that this class of
 bugs has been fixed in v299. (The infinite flicker is certainly fixed.)

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by mflatt at Wed, 27 Apr 2005 11:53:20 -0400
Reason>>> Probably fixed, but let's keep the PR until 299 is tested more.
