>Description:
Creating an mdi-child of an mdi-child will crash mred, under windows 98.
>How-To-Repeat:
The steps I did were:

1) create a mdi-parent with #f for a parent
2) create a mdi-parent & mdi-child with 1 as parent (no error is signaled
   and this frame does not appear inside 1.
3) create a mdi-child with 1 as parent.
4) create a mdi-child with 3 as parent. Crash.
