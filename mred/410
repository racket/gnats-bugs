>Description:
After minimizing modal dialog, it cannot be restored.

>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce:

1) Choose "File | Open"
2) Minimize the dialog box

The minimized dialog does not show up in window manager menu
(twm, in my case).  Minimizing/restoring DrScheme does not
bring up the dialog.  DrScheme is unusable at this point, 
since the dialog is modal.

State-Changed-Why:

This is a deeper problem than I thought. It seems that Window managers
don't put dialog boxes in their list of windows to un-iconify. The
window manager assumes that all dialog boxes have a parent frame, and
the manager auto-uniconifies dialog boxes when their parent frame is
uniconfied.

Here's the problem: In MrEd, a dialog box is not required to have a
parent frame. More to the point, MrEd and DrScheme often create dialog
boxes without a parent.

What should we do? Here's a proposal: Dialogs without a parent should
not be iconfiable. (Assuming this is possible to implement; I have a
collection of hacks in mind that should work.) In addition, [Robby, ]
the get-file, etc.  procedures should be extended to take an optional
parent dialog/frame, and this argument should be provided whenever
possible (pretty much always for get-file).

Any better ideas? Otherwise, can this be done for 51?
