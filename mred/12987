>Description:
Running the program below (under windows) causes
the window to be created and appear in the taskbar,
but it refuses to accept the selection and come to
the front (and probably all events are not getting
processes).

Removing the 'x' initialization argument to the
frame% makes it work again.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base
(require racket/gui/base
         racket/class)

(define f (new frame% [width 600] [height 800] [label ""] [x 400]))
(send f show #t)
