>Description:
There seems to be a dark like between the slider and the panel
tab selectors, possibly some artifact of drawing the slider, maybe the
slider just needs to be moved slightly lower?

(also not sure, but the panel tab selectors may look better if the
 first and last tabs were squared off at the ends, rather than leaving
 blank whitespace around the left and right most edges?)

>How-To-Repeat:
(look in the font & editing preference panels)

 Thanks for the reminder! I will fix this before the release.

 For this one, I was hoping to use the usual macos background of grey
 with white lines to fill in those gaps -- I suspect that will look
 good.
