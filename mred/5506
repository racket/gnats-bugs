>Description:
I'm not sure which file caused this, because the error
message doesn't say, but when I do a Find in Files...
(in DrScheme) and search in all of plt/, limiting to
files that end in .ss on the mac, I get this message:

Overread caused by file corruption or unknown internal error.
There was an error loading the file.
Overread caused by file corruption or unknown internal error.
There was an error loading the file.

I searched for htdp-full, but I doubt it mattters what
you search for, since the error is generated by loading
the file.

 This error comes from reading a WXME (MrEd non-text format) file.
 Perhaps there really is a corrupted file in your plt directory?

 It's possible. I will try to find it. Nevertheless, this is not a good
 error message!

 Perhaps. It is difficult to tell, however, since I cannot handle the
 error to tell which file is causing the problem.
