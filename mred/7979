 Here's the call:
 
 			  (send the-brush-list
 				find-or-create-brush
 				(send (send dc get-pen) get-color)
 				'solid)
 
 Looks like maybe something strange happening in the get-color method?
 
 Matthias -- this looks like what can go wrong if you turn off positive
 checks prematurely :) (well .... assuming the bug is what it appears to
 be at the moment)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sat, 25 Mar 2006 22:36:55 -0500
Reason>>> This shoiuld be fixed, now. I introduced the bug today
when reorganizing to make C++ new calls explicitly
use GC. I made the mistake of thinking that color objects
are atomic, but they can contain a pointer to a Scheme
object.

Thanks for the report!

 Matthew: have you had a chance to look into this bug? Matthias and I
 are really curious about it.

 Yes, I closed the PR. It was a memory bug that I introduced yesterday.
 
 You're not still seeing it, are you?

 I never saw it, actually.
 
 Here's a question: if the runtime system had contracts that actually
 checked that the results of the primitives were what they were supposed
 to be (instead of only checking inputs), would that have helped with
 this bug (or similar bugs) at all?

 Makes sense. You would have had to update from SVN between about 2:00pm
 and 10:00pm CST on Saturday.

 There's not much to be done for a memory bug. In this particular case,
 I was lucky: the corrupted memory happened to start with a valid type
 tag, and the stack trace was enough to make the problem obvious.

 If you have an assertion on the output side of a function, and it 
 doesn't respond properly to the check -- no matter what tag your funky 
 value has -- at least the program stops and you have an early 
 indication.

 The memory bug was in the JIT?
