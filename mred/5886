>Description:
Often when main menu headings are quickly single clicked (i.e.
the mouse button is not held down for any period of time), which
should simply open the menu item lists for subsequent selection
without the mouse button needing to be held down, this does not
happen until the mouse is actually moved. This in itself is not
catastrophic, but thought I'd make sure that appropriate parties
were aware of it, as it may be indicative of a subtle event processing
bug which may affect other aspects of user-interface or inter-process
communications in more insidious ways that weren't apparent to me.
>How-To-Repeat:
(try it, occasionally it appears to work fine, other times only after
 the main window title bar or some other content within the main
 window has been clicked).

State-Changed-Why:
    This doesn't happen for me, now. It's possible that it's fixed,
    and also possible that I'm just not clicking the right way.
    
    Paul: Do you still see the problem? (I.e., if you single-click on
    the menu bat, do you sometimes have to move the mouse to see
    a menu pop down?)
    
    Thanks,
    Matthew
State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:35:36 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
