>Description:
When snips are nested with no border, there is an
extra pixel appearing on the right of a second-level
deep editor. It appears between the second and third 
Xs in the code below.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (make-snip e) (make-object editor-snip% e #f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0))
(define top (make-object text%))
(define middle (make-object text%))
(define bottom (make-object text%))

(send top insert (make-snip middle))
(send middle insert "X")
(send middle insert (make-snip bottom))
(send middle insert "X")
(send bottom insert "X")

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define c (make-object editor-canvas% f top))
(send f show #t)

 Whoops, this is the extra pixel at the end of the line, reserved for
 the caret, itsn't it. So,
 I guess what I want is a way to turn off that pixel. I don't care if
 the caret cannot appear anymore. 
 
 Also, if this extra pixel is just turned off in postscript, that would
 be enough for me (but seems like a less perfect solution).

 The extra space is not due to the snip. It's due to the editor%'s size,
 as reported by get-extent.
 
 Actually, there should be 2 extra pixels, not 1, but media-snip%
 contains a hack that reduces the space to 1 (because it looks better).
 
 I'll have to think about this one more.

 I was under the impression that this pixel was there for the caret. If so,
 I am perfectly happy to say (up front, when creating an editor) that I
 never plan to use the caret in this editor, so don't show the space for
 it.
 
 While we are on the topic, how do subsequent editor-snips align
 themselves? If I had an editor-snip with some modern "a"s followed by an
 editor snip with some roman "a"s, the "a"s do not line up next to each
 other. (This is on the mac with courier and times, I think).

 In 101/6, use:
   (send an-editor-snip set-tight-text-fit #t)

 If the editor-snips have the default alignment (bottom), then the
 bottoms of the as should line up. I checked under X with different
 fonts and sizes for the "a"s. It's possible that there's a Mac-specific
 problem with get-text-extent in dc%.

 It does appear to be mac-specific. I have submitted a separate pr.
