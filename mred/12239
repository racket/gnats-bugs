 I'm still getting the followign symptoms.
 - spash never appears.
 - 'dr' takes a long tome to open/may be prompted by clicking in the toolbar.
 - simple gui windows dont appear until I attempt to quit
 - attmpting to close the 'dr' window causes the red dot to go dark, but
 fails to close the window, (DrRacket>close in the menu does work)
 
 Can I help inany way?

 Apologies --- after sending my message, we discovered that the change
 created problems for modal dialogs, such as the file dialog, so I
 reverted the change.
 
 I've pushed the fix again, this time with a correction for modal dialogs.
