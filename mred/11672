>Description:
Cmd-q seems to fail in a number of circumstances to actually close DrRacket successfully on the Mac, but one specific case I've identified is when a window is minimized. In this case cmd-q just seems to disappear into the ether.

This is a regression from 5.0.2 which correctly closed the application when the window was minimized.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket, minimize the window, press cmd-q.

 It also appears that the key sequence cmd-m, cmd-n fails to open a new
 window. As if key bindings are inactive with a minimized window. Also,
 clicking on the application dock icon normally brings up the last minimized
 window if no other windows are active, but that also seems to not work as
 expected.
