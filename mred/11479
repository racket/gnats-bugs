>Description:
Between every letter in the editor is a pixel location that is where the cursor would sit blinking if you clicked there.  If you click slightly to the right of the cursor, it doesn't move.  But if you click even a single pixel to the left of the cursor, the cursor jumps to the previous inter-character gap.  This is broken because it requires much greater mousing precision in the editing process (or at least, significant retraining from experience in other editing situations).  (This bug may be Win-specific; it doesn't apply to Macs, at least.)

Background:
I had sort of noticed my students having problems clicking where they meant to in DrRacket, and had chalked it up to computer inexperience, although it seemed strangely common.  But I've been dogfooding lately and found myself feeling weirdly incompetent with the mouse despite being perfectly comfortable with mouse usage for more than twenty years.  I click a spot and start editing only to find myself on the wrong side of a paren or space.

Analysis:
This is especially noticeable when trying to click to the right of a space character or a character whose glyph is narrow (such as punctuation, like parens, in most fonts).  You can have an I-bar mouse cursor that is entirely to the right of every darkened pixel of (say) a paren, click, and the vertical-line text cursor still places itself to the left of the paren.

For comparison, in Notepad (Win 7) if you click right in the middle of a letter it does put the insertion point to the left of that letter, but if you are near the right side of the character it will "round up" and put the insertion point after the character---the cutoff seems to be around 2/3 the width of the character.  (On a Mac, both TextEdit and DrRacket round up or down relative to the middle of the character.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new DrRacket window.

Type "as(df:gh  jkl"
Click to right of colon.
Line up I-bar mouse cursor with vertical-bar text cursor.
Click---the cursor doesn't move.
Move mouse one pixel to the left---still well to the right of the colon.
Click---the text cursor jumps to the left.

Try to click in the middle of the two spaces, aiming slightly right of centre---easy to hit.
Click elsewhere.
Try to click in the middle of the two spaces, aiming slightly left of centre---asymmetric and much harder to hit.
