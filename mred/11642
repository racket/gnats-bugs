>Description:
When there's a submenu where all entries are disabled, the behavior on linux is
confusing.  For example, say that there are no bug reports -- on windows, I'll see
the "Saved bug reports" menu entry with an arrow indicating a submenu, and hitting
the right key there will open the submenu with the disabled entry highlighted.  On
linux the arrow indicator is there too, but hitting "right" doesn't open the submenu,
instead, it behaves as if there was no indicator and moves to the File menu.

This is probably related to another annoyance on linux -- hitting enter is not like
clicking the menu item -- the submenu is being displayed because I'm "hovering" over
it, but nothing else happens.
