>Description:
Sometimes, the on-default-action of a wx:dialog-box is called
with "null" as an argument, and not an object. According to the
docs this should never be the case.

I believe it happens when nothing is selected in the dialog.

I gave this PR high priority only for the answer to this question:
  Is this a bug in the docs or the code?
