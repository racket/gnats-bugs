>Description:
Screenshot: http://imm.io/3Rwk
The high CPU usage shown was when I was resizing the panels by moving the central separator up and down.

High CPU usage is also observed when browsing through the preferences.

System specs:
Core2Duo P8400 @2.26Ghz, 4GB DDR2, 320GB HDD, 64-bit Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 on 80GB partition (fully updated), 64-bit DrRacket v5.1.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrRacket
2. Try to resize the two editing panels vertically by moving the central bar. It will be very sluggish and CPU usage will be very high.
3. Open the preferences and cycle through the tabs while observing CPU usage. The response will again be sluggish, amd CPU usage will go up, although not by as much as Step2 above.
