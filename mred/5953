>Description:
Can't highlight a region of text in DrScheme in order to paste over it (ie replace region with clip board contents).  By highlighting, the region is automatically put into clipboard and therefore the paste just replaces the region with the same region.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copy some text, A
Select a region in DrScheme, B
Paste
B remains, and is in clip board. 
A is gone from clip board.

 Sadly, this is the behavior of X Windows for all programs (try xterm).
 You can get back to the old contents of the clipboard using meta-y,
 tho. That is, use control-y to paste and then meta-y will replace the
 pasted text with the last version of the clipboard.

 I believe this is the standard behavior of all X applications.  Other 
 platforms don't do it this way, it's true.  I'm not sure this is 
 something that can easily be changed.
