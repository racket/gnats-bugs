>Description:
If you move "create-image" from the top module to the bottom module in this program 
below, the (send ... insert ...) message blows up, claiming that the bitmap is a 
character and the method call ill-formed. 

(module create-embedded-snip mzscheme 
  (require 
   (lib "class.ss")
   (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
  
  (define-struct aircraft (name image))
  
  (define (create-image txt fil)
    (define bm (make-object bitmap% fil 'jpeg))
    (define dc (new bitmap-dc% [bitmap bm]))    
    (send dc set-text-foreground (make-object color% "red"))
    (send dc draw-text txt 1 -1)
    (send dc set-bitmap #f)
    (make-object image-snip% bm))
  
  (define a (make-aircraft "I-16" (create-image "I-16" "I-16.jpg")))
  
  (provide a aircraft-image))

(module consume mzscheme
  (require 
   (lib "class.ss")
   (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
  
  (require create-embedded-snip)
  
  (define frame (new frame% [label "error"]))
  
  (define tx (new text%))
  (define ec (new editor-canvas% [editor tx][parent frame]
                  [style '(no-border no-hscroll no-vscroll)]
                  [min-width 85]
                  [min-height 70]
                  [stretchable-width #f]
                  [stretchable-height #f]
                  [horizontal-inset 5]
                  [vertical-inset 5]))
  (send tx insert (aircraft-image a) 0)
  
  (send frame show #t))

(require consume)

In principle, this is a functional refactoring and should work just fine. 
You can put a printf in front of the (send tx insert ...) call and
verify that the image is a bitmap. Tuff. 

WARNING: the above is NOT a mechanism for reproducing this bug. 
I was unable to create a small file that reproduces this error. 
I did reproduce it many times in a larger example than the above
(some 400 lines in 2 modules) but I am reluctant to submit those. 

So consider this a warning that something is wrong but I can't 
do better with the example. Perhaps one day I can and show you 
what's wrong. 

[NB: this is also the code that causes crashes in 3m routinely.]

 I don't quite understand this bug report. If I move the `create-image'
 call down, then I also need to adjust the exports of the first module,
 or something like that.
 
 I suspect the real problem is whatever is causing the crash, though,
 and the other message is a result of memory being trashed in some
 consistent way.
 
 Maybe it has something to do with this specific image file. Are you
 using it a lot in the cases where DrScheme crashes? Or maybe other
 images of a similar size and shape?
 
 In any case, can you send me the image file?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I'll spend an hour today reconstructing the error with large files.  
 This is important to me.
 
 And yes: when I was working with these two modules and the images, I  
 experienced a ton of crashes.
 
 The whole thing is in svn: ~matthias/Squadron/ though I may have to  
 turn on permissions in auth.

 I give up.
 
 I restore the two modules to the state that caused the problems with  
 images. And sure enough, the problem didn't show up. Also, I have had  
 no crashes, which I also expected to come back (and I had been  
 running the poor dr in gdb).
 
 So whatever you fixed between december 21 and now may have removed  
 the bug that I was experiencing where this fragment
 
        (define tx (new text%))
        (define ec (new editor-canvas% [editor tx][parent pic]
                        [style '(no-border no-hscroll no-vscroll)]
                        [min-width 85][stretchable-width #f]
                        [min-height 60][stretchable-height #f]
                        [horizontal-inset 5][vertical-inset 5]))
        (printf "snip: ~s\n" sn)
        (send tx insert sn 0 0 #f)
 
 would signal an error for the insert message about sn being a byte  
 and the message having the wrong format even though the printf  
 message confirmed that it was an image-snip.

 P.S. The files are labeled error- ... scm in the svn directory I  
 mentioned this morning.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 03:40:06 -0400
Reason>>> mred?  looks like the problem did not repeat.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:48:18 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
