 How are you "reopening" your code? What kind of computer are you using? You
 might have a problem if your file name does not end in ".ss". Try making
 sure that you use the ".ss" ending. 
 
 Also, see if you get a window somewhere with an error message, besides the
 "error initializing" window, and send me the contents of that message.
 
 Thanks for your report!
