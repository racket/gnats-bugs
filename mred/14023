>Description:
Hi,

When calling `clear' and then `set' from within the `list-box%' callback, it triggers another undesired 'list-box event (possibly looping).

In the following code, once the frame is shown, click on "b", the second item.
This triggers a first 'list-box event, but the `clear' and `set' calls trigger another one, and so on:

#lang racket/gui

(define my-frame (new frame% [label "my-frame"] 
                      [min-width 200] [min-height 200]))

(define lb (new list-box%
                [parent my-frame]
                [label "values"]
                [choices '("a" "b")]
                [callback (?(lb ev) 
                            (displayln (send ev get-event-type))
                            (send lb clear)
                            (send lb set '("b"))
                            )]))

(send my-frame show #t)

; Click on "b", this will trigger infinite events

With clickable-headers, clicking the column header will have the same behavior.


On a side note, although I'm very happy to have a multi-column list box%, it looks half-baked:
- For example there is no `get' and `append-row' methods, and the initial `choices' is useless for multi-column
- I had to make a complicated and quite inefficient wrapper with a lot of data duplication to be able to sort the columns when clicking on them:
https://github.com/Metaxal/bazaar/blob/master/gui/list-box-sort.rkt

I took a look at the list-box% code, but couldn't really find my way around, as methods are dispatched in several places.

In case this is too complicated to resolve, could you at least tell me so, so that I can build work arounds? 
(this is slightly blocking me right now actually)

Thank you,
Laurent

 As mentioned on the mailing list, the simple solution is to avoid using
 `(clear)' and `(set ...)' in the callback at the same time.
 Since the it is not possible (it seems) to use `set' to empty the choices,
 one has to use a condition:
 (if (empty? new-choices)
     (clear)
     (set new-choices))
 
 Maybe it's just sufficient to add a warning in the docs then.

 I'm still a bit surprised that this would go into a loop, as invoking the
 methods directly generally does not invoke the callbacks.
 
 (But I'm not 100% clear on this.)

 Yes, it's surprising (tracking it down was punctuated by some "What the
 hell is going on?!" ;) ).
 Do you see this behavior on non-gtk platforms?
