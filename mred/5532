 Summary: get-directory fails to use defalt dir spec
 
 Description:
 
 get-directory does not seem to recognize its
 third argument (default directory designator).
 
 Steps to Reproduce:
 
 In the following program,
 
 (get-directory "Select Again" #f
                (get-directory "Select" #f #f))
 
 the first (inner) selector brings up my My Documents.
 Choosing a different directory and clicking OK doesn't
 help: the second (outer) selector still starts in
 My Documents.
