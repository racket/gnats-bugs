>Description:
I installed the new release 2.05 on my ibook and 
the editor is missing the button bar at the top of the window
 (with "check syntax" "execute" buttons etc.)
I've tried reinstalling with no luck.
And I've reinstalled 2.04 and it has the button bar.
>How-To-Repeat:

 Try clicking on the wide button on the top right of the DrScheme
 window. It should appear. I'm not sure why it disappeared. I believe
 that there is a bug tho -- when you iconify the window, it
 automatically "clicks" that button too. Something to watch out for.
 Sorry.

State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed for the next release, assuming that you
    got into the mysterious state by minimizing the
    DrScheme window (which is how most people get there).
    
    Thanks for the bug report,
