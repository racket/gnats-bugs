 What is the depth of your display (16? 24? 32?) and what X Server are
 you running (XFree? Windows X-Win?)?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I'm using X-Win32 on champlain, which has 65K colors, so 16-bit
 color depth, I'd guess.

State-Changed-Why:
Turns out that X Win is 24-bit color in 32 bits per pixel.
XFree is 24-bit color in 24 bits per pixel.
By calling XCreateImage once, MrEd can distinguish these cases
and handle them appropriately.
