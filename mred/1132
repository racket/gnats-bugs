>Description:
When using check syntax, the popup menu's rename identifier
item calls get-text-from-user and the focus is never set to the
text object. This is the call:

(mred:get-text-from-user
 "Rename Identifier"
 (format "Rename ~a to:" id-name)
 #f
 (format "~a" id-name))

This is in plt/collects/drscheme/tools/syncheck/unit.ss

Unfortunately, this call by itself does set the focus; only when
using drscheme is it wrong. I dont know what could be different.

 One difference is that evaluating the expression above in DrScheme (or
 MrEd) creates a new window in an empty eventspace, so the keyboard
 focus must shift eventspaces. When check syntax calls
 get-text-from-user, the focus must shift within an eventspace. So the
 problem may be some sort of race condition.
 
 What happens with the following code?:
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 (define frame (make-object frame% "SendCode" #f 100 100))
 (define canvas (make-object editor-canvas% frame (make-object text%)))
 
 (send frame show #t)
 
 (thread
  (lambda ()
    (sleep 4)
    (queue-callback
     (lambda ()
       (get-text-from-user
        "Rename Identifier"
        "Rename ? to:"
        #f
        "?")))))
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 If the focus is set correctly by the above code, then the next test is
 to call get-text-from-user via a clickback (to see whether it has
 something to do with event handling in canvases). If that still doesn't
 reproduce the bug, then the next test is a clickback that pops up a
 menu that calls get-text-from-user (to see whether it has something to
 do with popup menus). If that still doesn't reproduce the bug, then I'm
 stuck until we get more information.

 This code reproduces the bug:
 
 (define frame (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 100))
 
 (define text
   (make-object
    (class text% ()
      (override
        [on-event
         (lambda (evt)
           (when (send evt button-down?)
             (get-text-from-user
              "Rename Identifier"
              "Rename ? to:"
              #f
              "?")))])
      (sequence (super-init)))))
 
 (define canvas (make-object editor-canvas% frame text))
 
 (send text insert "text")
 
 (send frame show #t)
 
 (also works if on-event is replaced with on-default-event, but I figure this
 one is more primitive)
