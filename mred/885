>Description:
I have several times now had a student in our lab do a large upward scroll
(by dragging scroll bar, I think) in the DrScheme interaction window
and wind up with a panel telling them that there was an internal error,
that make-object expected a first argument of type <class> and instead
got #<bad-value>, with additional arguments 100.0 and 183.0.  We haven't
found any way to recover short of killing the process.  I have not
succeeded in replicating the behavior myself, but as mentioned have now
seen it repeatedly.  In each case where I have observed it, the following
three things have been true.  I don't know whether any are relevant:

 (1) The student had the preference set to keep interaction history

 (2) The student had selected the concabs.ss library

 (3) The student had used that library to do evaluations that resulted in
      "fungraph snips" (graphical images produced by funcitonal means).

The concabs.ss library (which may not even be relevant, but I don't know)
is available at
