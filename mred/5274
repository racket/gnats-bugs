 I'm not able to reproduce this problem; bitmaps are scaled for me.
 
 Any ideas why my program might not match yours? My complete program is

 Thanks,

 (define bitmap 
   (make-object bitmap% (build-path (collection-path "icons") "bb.gif")))
 
 (define f (make-object frame% "Hi" #f 300 300))
 (define c (make-object canvas% f))
 (send f show #t)
 
 
 (define dc (send c get-dc))
 (send dc set-scale 1.0 1.0)
 (send dc draw-bitmap bitmap 0 0)
 (sleep 1)
 (send dc set-scale 2.0 2.0)
 (send dc draw-bitmap bitmap 0 0)
