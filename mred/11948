>Description:
The scroll wheel (and corresponding mouse-pad motion) on
macs doesn't behave correctly for list boxes.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a mac, run this program:

#lang racket
(require racket/gui/base)

(define dialog (instantiate dialog% ("dialog")))
(new message% [parent dialog] 
              [label "long enough to be visible"])
(define list-box (new list-box% 
                      [label ""]
                      [choices (list "choice1" "choice2"
                                     "choice3" "choice4"
                                     "choice5" "choice6")]
                      [parent dialog]))

(send dialog show #t)


... then use the scroll wheel to scroll down.  When you 
get to the bottom, it silently jumps up to the top again,
giving the appearance of a *really long* list.
