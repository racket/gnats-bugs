>Description:
The ascent descent and height return values from get-text-extent do
not seem to depend on the string passed to get-text-extent.

For example, I would expect that "g" and "1" should have different
ascent and descent, but they don't. Both have ascent 4 and descent 0.

Also, the strings "()" and "0" appear to have the same ascent, descent,
and height, but the parenthesis string should be slightly taller.

My font configuration is:

mred.ScreenDecorative__:	
mred.DrScheme-splash-max-width:	140
mred.MrEd-REPL-size:	(790 425)
mred.ScreenSwiss__:	
mred.DrScheme-splash-max-depth:	6
mred.ScreenModern__:	
mred.defaultFontSize:	12
mred.ScreenRoman__:	
mred.ScreenDefault__:	

but that may be wrong, since MrEd eats that file occasionally. I am
looking at the font:

-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

(I matched this up visually, using xfontsel)
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is some code that tries to box strings exactly:

(define (draw dc)
  (let*-values ([(str1) "g"]
		[(width1 height1 ascent1 descent1)
		 (send dc get-text-extent str1)]
		[(str2) "012j34"]
		[(width2 height2 ascent2 descent2)
		 (send dc get-text-extent str2)])
		
    (send dc draw-text str1 0 0)
    (send dc draw-rectangle 0 0 width1 height1)

    (send dc draw-text str2 0 height1)
    (send dc draw-rectangle 0 height1 width2 (- height2 descent2))

    (printf "descent1: ~a~n" descent1)
    (printf "ascent1: ~a~n" ascent1)
    (printf "descent2: ~a~n" descent2)
    (printf "ascent2: ~a~n" ascent2)))

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define c (make-object (class canvas% ()
			 (inherit get-dc)
			 (override
			  [on-paint (lambda () (draw (get-dc)))])
			 (sequence
			   (super-init f)))))

(send c min-width 100)
(send c min-height 100)
(send f show #t)

 The ascent and descent are font-specific, not string-specific. The
 documentation technically claims that they're font-specific, but I'll
 make it even clearer.

 So, how do I get the string specific information? Write the string into a
 bitmap and count pixels?

 Portably? Beats me. Years ago, I couldn't find a way to do it in MacOS.
 
 .. I just went to the library and consulted the new-style humongo
 MacOS book "Text". Still no dice. ...
 
 It appears that X provides per-character ascent and decent information.
 I don't know about Windows, if you can tell me how to do it in MacOS,
 I'll look into it.

 Well, there you have it...
