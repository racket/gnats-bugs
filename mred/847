>Description:

this may not technically be a bug, but IMO text%'s caret should not blink
unless the text is ready to receive input. Right now, when a menu is pulled 
down, the caret continues to blink while the menu is shown.

State-Changed-Why:

It would be extremely difficult to fix this. The problem is that the
menu must grab the mouse and keyboard, but to X a grab means don't
even send focus-change events to other windows. The menus must use a
grab, and sending manual focus events highly error-prone, so I'm going
to leave this one alone for a while.
