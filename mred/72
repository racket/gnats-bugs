>Description:
A backwards replace-all does only one replace, not all, when the search 
string matches the replace string (and thus would give an infinite loop
if you're not careful).  The forward direction does replace all.

Also, if the search string doesn't match the replace string (so no 
danger of infinite loop), then replace-all does replace all, both
forwards and backwards (correct).

So, I'm guessing there's some special check to avoid infinite loops
that isn't quite right going backwards.

Ok, probably no one will ever notice or care ....
(but The Machine is having trouble fulfilling its quota :-)
(and The Machine likes regular expressions.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Enter "aa2aa2aa" into definitions window.
Set search string to "2" and replace string to "22".

Forward Replace-All starting from beginning of buffer gives
"aa22aa22aa".

But backward Replace-All starting from end of buffer gives
"aa2aa22aa".
