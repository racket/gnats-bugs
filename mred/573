>Description:

run the code below. The frames that appear have two menu entries (the first 
of which is blank) and they should only have one.

>How-To-Repeat:

(define generate (let ([n 2000]) (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) n)))

(define (testA t)
  (define f (make-object wx:frame% null "menu test A" 0 0 300 100))
  (define mb (make-object wx:menu-bar%))
  (define m (make-object wx:menu%))
  (t m)
  (send m append (generate) "test2")
  (send mb append m "menu")
  (send f set-menu-bar mb)
  (send f show #t))

(testA (lambda (m)
	 (send m append (generate) "test0")
	 (send m delete-by-position 0)))
(testA (lambda (m)
	 (let ([test1 (generate)])
	   (send m append test1 "test1")
	   (send m delete test1))))

 Yep - the test suite only tested deleting from the end of a menu (even
 though I remembered to test deleting from the middle of a menu bar).

State-Changed-When: Wed Apr 22 09:41:10 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Actually, there was a test for delete-from-the-middle. But there was no
test for delete-all-items-and-add-a-new-one, which was the bug. The
delete method actually works, but the append method didn't properly
handle an empty menu state except for the initial state.

Fixed and released for FreeBSD.

 Ah, that's good news for me, tho. I can just re-order my deletes for now.
 
 BTW, I also saw some wierdness using delete-by-position. Somehow, if I
 deleted too much, new entires wouldnt be added in. I was alsyways passing 0 
 as the final argument to delete-by-position and calling delete-by-position
 at least one more time than the number of menu items. I couldn't get that
 to reproduce in a small setting, tho. But, maybe you will see something,
 while you are down in there.
