>Description:
The behavior of popping menus when the Meta key is pressed is probably
something that should make Windows users feel better...  However, the
natural thing for these users who did this by mistake is to hit it again
to close the window, but this just re-pops it...
It would be nice to have it close an already opened menu or better - have
a way of configuring this behavior.

 The ESC key pops it back down. This is the same as Windows, so that
 those of us who use both don't go crazy. :)
 
 With some effort, I could make it configurable, but is it enough that
 ESC works?
