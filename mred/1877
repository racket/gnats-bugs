When a snip is inserted into a pasteboards at a negative position, it can
be lost. The scroll bars don't let you scroll to it.

>How-To-Repeat:

(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400 400))
(define pb (make-object pasteboard%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f pb))
(send pb insert (make-object string-snip% "abcdef") -10 0)
(send f show #t)
