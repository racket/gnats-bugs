>Description:
If I change the language and exit via the File|Quit menu item,
my changes to the language are saved. If I change the language
and exit by clicking the close box on the window, my changes
are not saved.

The same appears to be true for the REPL interaction history,
but not preferences (i.e., preference changes are saved by
either quit method).

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme, init language is A
Change language to B
Quit via menu
Start DrScheme, language is B
Change language to C
Quit via close box
Start DrScheme, language is B (not C)
