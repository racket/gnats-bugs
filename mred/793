>Description:
copying is slow on the mac, and pasting is really slow.

During the paste, the scrollbar moves along, but the screen doesn't redraw.

Apologies if this is a partial repeat. I thought that there was a pasting
pr, but I didn't find it. In any case, I don't think that there ever
was a copying pr submitted.
