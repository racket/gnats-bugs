>Description:
Combo fields, up until recently, had a button at the right end of the text entry area, labelled with up/down triangles.  When pressed, the button opened a popup menu with the combo field's choices in it.  Now there is no button, and to open the popup menu I have to click a small range of pixels (which I found only by guessing) on the right of the text entry area.

The code under "steps to reproduce" creates an displays a combo field.  On my computer, running PLT Scheme built from SVN revision 14578, it demonstrates this bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/gui

(define f (new frame% [label "Test Frame"]))
(define c (new combo-field% [label "Test Combo"] [choices (list "A" "B" "C")] [parent f]))

(send f show #t)

Reason>>> finally fixed in svn
