>Description:
The hotspot for the ibeam cursor is near the top of the cursor.
I was under the impression that it should be near the bottom. (around
the "baseline"). Netscape also seems to have near the top, tho. 
I don't have MS Word (or Psyscope :) to test with.

We're using the cursor that's built into the System. I'll trust Apple
on this one.
