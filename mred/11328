>Description:
When I use open from the shell in mac os x to open a file in the gr2 drracket, sometimes it causes drracket to go into a loop. It doens't happen every time, but it has happened the second time I opened a file twice in a row now.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:45:03 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
