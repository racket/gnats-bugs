>Description:
	The stipple pen behaves differently on different platforms.
        On unix, if drawing in copy mode, and on a black background, you
see nothing. 
	On nt, copy mode, black background, you see the pattern

	There also seems to be a problem with the actual stipple itself in
this example. On nt, it doesn't look like a the gray pattern, but on X it
does.
>How-To-Repeat:

evaluate this:

(define black-brush
  (send wx:the-brush-list find-or-create-brush "BLACK" wx:const-solid))
(define stipple-pen (make-object wx:pen%))

;; gray pattern
(define bits 
  (map integer->char (list #xaa #x55 #xaa #x55 #xaa #x55 #xaa #x55)))

(send* stipple-pen 
  (set-style wx:const-stipple)
  (set-stipple (make-object wx:bitmap% bits 8 8 1)))

(define f (make-object wx:frame% '() "pasteboard" 100 100 210 210))
(define p (make-object wx:panel% f))
(define c (make-object wx:media-canvas% p))
(define p% (class-asi wx:media-pasteboard%
	     (public
	       [on-paint
		(lambda (before dc left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret)
		  (unless before
		    (send dc set-logical-function wx:const-copy)
		    (send dc set-pen stipple-pen)
		    (send dc set-brush black-brush)
		    (send dc draw-rectangle dx dy 200 100)
		    (send dc draw-line (+ dx 100) dy (+ dx 100) (+ dy 200))))])))

(define p (make-object p%))
(send c set-media p)
(send f show #t)

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed by adding wx:const-opaque-stipple, which is guranteed
to have the opaque behaviro. wx:const-stipple was left
ill-defined for backward compatility.
