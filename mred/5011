>Description:
I have 6 DrScheme windows open. I am editing stuff in window
#6. DrScheme starts garbage collecting. Since the process is
146MB in size, it takes a little while. After the GC is done,
window #6 starts showing the content of window #5. No
more editing is possible in window #6 (but the other windows
are fine). Actually, the content of window #6 seems to change
over time: right now it shows a mix of the content of window
#5, and of the content of this very bug report... The funny
thing is, I tried to save the content of window #6 (the menus
are still working, except that I cannot undo/redo anything),
and the content of the saved file is still the original text
that I was editing in window #6 before the problem
showed up...

>How-To-Repeat:
Don't know. It's the first time it happens, so I have no
hope to be able to reproduce it. This bug report is just
for informational purposes...

 All editors share a common offscreen bitmap. It sounds like something
 has gone wrong with that bitmap in window #6; maybe the editor in
 window #6 thinks it's drawing to the bitmap, but it isn't. I can't
 think of how that would happen, though.
 
 Thanks for the alert,
 Matthew
