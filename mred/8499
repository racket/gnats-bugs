>Description:
I started playing with timer% in an effort to understand and tweak the world.ss teachpack, and the only answer I ever get back from (send timer interval) is 0.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define my-time (new timer% (notify-callback (lambda () (display "Ha!")))))
(send my-time start 1500) ; starts printing "Ha!"'s, as expected
(send my-time interval) ; returns 0, expected 1500
(send my-time stop) ; stops printing, as expected
(send my-time interval) ; still returns 0
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 25 Jan 2007 20:06:38 -0500
Reason>>> The `interval' method was broken under Mac OS X.
It's now fixed for the next version.

Thanks!
Matthew
