>Description:
Importing readline from the mred-text repl doesn't activate readline, but starting mred-text as `mred-text -il readline` does. This is inconvenient, e.g., when you include "(require readline/rep)" in .mzschemerc and mred-text fails to respond to it.

mzscheme doesn't share the problem, it works fine there.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run mred-text -il readline
2. Observe that readline is active

1. Run mred-text
2. Eval any of (require (lib "readline")), (require readline/rep), or (require readline)
3. Observe that readline is not active
