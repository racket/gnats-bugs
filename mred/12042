>Description:
On OSX I was morbidly curious about what would happen with the frame style 'mdi-parent.  Rather than failing as expected, Dr. Racket crashes.  

In the bug submission form, had there been a pull-down option even lower on the totem pole than "non-critical", I would have chosen it.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

; inappropriately executed on OSX in Dr. Racket
(define frame 
  (new frame%
       [ label "test" ]
       [ style '(mdi-parent) ]))
