(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define p (make-object panel% f))
(make-object message% "test" p)
(make-object message% "test" f)
(send p set-label-font (send the-font-list find-or-create-font

 ???
 
 From the docs:
 
  set-label-font
 
  Sets the font for drawing
 
  ...
 
  Only controls and sub-containers created after the call to
  set-label-font are affected...
 
 This requirement can't be lifted (without extreme effort).
