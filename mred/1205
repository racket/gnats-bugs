>Description:
I would like the callback for a text-field% (or something)
to be informed when the text-field loses the focus
and when the option / command / shift / control keys
are pressed.

Is that possible?
>How-To-Repeat:
I tried this program:
  
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 100))
(define t (make-object text-field% #f f (lambda x (display x) (newline))))
(define t (make-object text-field% #f f (lambda x (display x) (newline))))
(send f show #t)

and didn't get any feedback when pressing the modifier keys or
clicking the focus around. I also didn't see anything on a
pane that indicated the information being there either (this is
only one of the possible parents of a text-field% tho; why
isn't the proper interface used? (area-container<%>?))

 Use on-focus and pre-on-event.
