 Hi Jean-Paul,
 
   I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble reproducing the problem you're
 having with DrScheme. I started up DrScheme, typed cmd-q, and DrScheme
 is gone. Can you be more specific about how you see the problem?
 (starting from a fresh drscheme, what do you do, what do you see, and
 what did you expect to see?)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Oh, I see. We will look into that.

 Yes, this appears to be correct now.

 It should work without internet access. DrScheme starts it's own
 webserver running internally and uses that to serve the pages to a
 local browser. If it requires an enabled network for you, can you let
 us know your networking configuration so we can look into it more
 closely?
 
 > I didn't find open-url anymore. Gone ?
 
 There is an open-url in the browser collection that opens our homebrew
 browser:
 
   (require (lib "browser.ss" "browser"))
   (open-url "http://...")
 
 but you might prefer send-url:
 
   (require (lib "browser.ss" "net"))
   (send-url "http://...")
 
 which sends a url to the user's preferred browser. Finally, there is a
 third variety:
 
   (require (lib "send-url.ss" "net"))
   (send-url "http://...")
 
 which is just like the previous one, except that if the usre's
 preferred browser isn't set, it doesn't prompt the user for a choice
 and just uses the default (this version doesn't require the graphical
 library).
 
 I believe that the default buisiness is academic on all platforms
 except unix/X, since the default browser is chosen by the OS, we don't
 maintain a separate preference.

 Do you have a dialup connection at home?

 Okay, now I'm baffled. A month ago, I could reliably cause IE to fail
 to connect to drscheme when in dialup mode. Now I cannot get it to fail
 at all. (I've still got os x 10.1). There have been a few security
 patches and things that might have fixed a bug somewhere. I find it
 quite strange.
 
 Do you mind trying this out on your mac when you get a chance and see
 if you can get IE to fail?

 Since I NFS-mount my home directory, it's difficult to test this
 behavior. I have to take the machine down.
 
 If it's still an issue, I can try sometime next week.

 I've been doing some experimenting on my macintosh and haven't been
 able to find the problem. So, let me ask some questions:
 
   - at home, do you use a dialup modem to connect? If not, how do you
     connect to the internet?
 
   - what version of the OS are you using? Are you up to date with all
     of the patches from apple? (you can run "software update" from the
     "system preferences" to be sure).
 
    - What kind of error message do you see? Which application gives you
      the error message?
 
 Thanks for taking the time to help us debug the problem!
 
 Also, for our next release, we are going include a fallback mechanism
 that allows us to use our own (bad) browser to view the help desk
 pages. They won't look good, but at least it will be reliable....

 I don't have any idea about the first two questions, but Matthew Flatt
 might.
 
 As far as the class-field-mutator goes, I think that the answer is no.
 The class-field-mutator accepts a class and returns a procedure that
 affects instances of the class, not the class itself. So, it's just
 more like the . and = combined together. Ie, this expression (apologies
 if I forgot some semicolons):
 
    class C {int f;}
    C c = new C();
    c.f=1
 
 becomes:
 
   (define c% (class object% (field (f 2)) (super-instantiate ())))
   (define set-c-f (class-field-mutator c% f))
   (define c (instantiate c% ()))
   (set-c-f c 1)
 
 The Scheme version is more verbose because classes are first-class
 objects in Scheme, so you have to give mzscheme more help to tell it
 things that Java can infer statically (like the connection between the
 instance c and the field f).
