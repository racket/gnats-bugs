>Description:
When there is a editor snip in a text% with space above it 
(because somthing on the line is tall) clicking in that space
sends the focus to the embedded editor and not the outer editor,
even tho the click was outside the box outlining the outer editor.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 300 300))
(define t (make-object text%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))

(define t2 (make-object text%))
(send t2 insert "abcdef")
(send t insert (make-object editor-snip% t2))

(send t insert
      (let loop ([n 10])
	(cond
	 [(zero? n) (make-object editor-snip% (make-object text%))]
	 [else
	  (let ([text (make-object text%)])
	    (send text insert (loop (- n 1)))
	    (make-object editor-snip% text))])))

(send f show #t)

;; click in the space above the box on the right. The cursor
;; goes inside the box even tho the click was outside it.
