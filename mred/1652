>Description:
Using DrScheme 1.02 on a Macintosh
Running Solution to Ex 2.2.1 (Fahrenheit->Celsius) with the convert.ss teachpack:
In the graphical interface an artifact appears to the right of the number below the Fahrenheit slider when a new number with more digits or a negative number is selected, either with the slider or the arrow keys.
The numbers are redrawn when the window is resized so this is a kludge for the moment.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) define Fahrenheit->Celsius
2) load convert.ss teachpack
3) Execute
4) run (convert-gui Fahrenheit->Celsius)
5) increase Fahrenheit slider to 3 digit number and notice artifact to the right of the number.
6) decrease the F slider to 2 digit number and notice the artifact is still there.
7) decrease the F slider to negative number and notice the same problem.

 Robby, you improved that part of the code. Could you check it out, please? 
 Thanks -- Matthias

 This is a bug in the mred binary. Please add this to the test suite (surprised it isn't already there, actually). Here's how to reproduce:
 
 (define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
 (make-object slider% #f -100 100 f void)
 (send f show #t)
 
 Slide the slider. As the numbers get narrower, they don't erase the wider numbers that were there before. That is, if the slider had a "-100" drawn below it and you slide it over to -50, it will leave a little bit of the -100 drawn outside the -50.
 
 This is easily reproducible under MacOS 8.6.
 
 Robby
