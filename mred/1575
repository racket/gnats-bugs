>Description:
In X, selecting text replaces what is currently on the clipboard.
This is probably a feature rather than a bug but it keeps me 
from using copy/paste to replace a section of selected text. That is,
I select some text, copy it, select some more text that I want
to replace, and paste -- no change takes place.



>How-To-Repeat:
Select some text.
Copy (meta+c).
Select some more text.
Paste (meta+v)

 This used to bother me a lot, too, but as you say, it's the X standard.
 I found that doing something non-standard just confused me overall in
 using X programs.
 
 For what it's worth, ctl-y (paste) followed by esc-Y (paste previous)
 does what you want, but only when the copy source is within
 MrEd/DrScheme.
