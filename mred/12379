>How-To-Repeat:
I haven't got a good recipe to reproduce (I may look into it later, but I don't have time right now and thought the error context might be helpful enough), but it's happened 3 times in the last few minutes.  It's something like this:

1. Search for some text
2. Insert text around an instance of found text (possibly it has something to do with your new text containing the text you searched for)

 Oh, and I think that actually this _must_ be a bug in the record and reply
 code, if only for the simple reason that we should not see stacktraces like
 that.
 
 That is, the draw-ellipse method should be checking its arguments in the
 original context, and then we should not see errors when the draw-ellipse
 call is replayed.

 I don't see how the ellipses being drawn by the search results can possibly
 be responsible for this error. If you look at the source code for the place
 where that ellipse is drawn, you'll find it on line 462 in
 collects/framework/private/text.rkt where you can see that it passes (+
 width 8) as that third argument. The binding for width is (max 0 (- right
 left)), and there are no assignments to that variable. So I don't think
 that the search bubbles are the relevant ellipses here (either that, or
 there is a bug in the draw-ellipsis code, I suppose).
 
 One clue might be that the stacktrace shows that this is using the
 record-dc.rkt.  Maybe that is going wrong somehow?
 
 In any case, I think that some help trying to reproduce this would be
 useful. It may turn out to be nothing related to those ellipses at all, but
 instead some other ellipses.

Date: Sat, 26 Nov 2011 15:31:07 -0700

 I'm not sure I follow all of your reasoning, but
 
  * I think the exception is raised by the checking of arguments to a
    direct call to `draw-ellipse'. It happens that the canvas's DC is an
    instance of an internal `record-dc%', and `record-dc%' does defer
    the checking of arguments to its superclass, but the intent is that
    the exception is just from a generic `dc%'. The stack trace doesn't
    seem to be from a replay (and commands are recorded in `record-dc%'
    only after they are successfully sent to the superclass methods).
 
  * While it's true that `width' is defined as `(- right left)', the
    value for `right' might be derived from the canvas view rather than
    the `rectangle' record in cases where `left' comes from the
    rectangle record. (See the construction on line 249, for example).
    So, it seems possible for `right' to be less than `left'.
 
 Even with those thoughts, though, I wasn't able to replicate the error,
 so the conclusion is overall the same: we need more help replicating
 the error.

 Ah. Duh-- the stack frame points to some questionable call to
 draw-ellipse in the debugger. I've safeguarded those and I'll close
 the PR when I can next commit.

 The width I was talking about (the one in implementation of the
 framework's search bubbles) is bound to:
 
     (max 0 (- right left))
 
 not (- right left).

 I'm not sure that I had the debugger open every time I got the error, but
 there's a pretty good chance I did.  Would you still like me to try to find
 a way to replicate?

 I don't think it is necessary. Judging from the stack trace, I'm
 pretty sure that I fixed what you were seeing. It also seems to be not
 very easy to reproduce.
