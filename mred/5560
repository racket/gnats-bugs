I am not really sure if it is a bug or not, but I can not find a way to print the drawings which I created on the canvas after loading the draw.ss teachpack.  Is it posible to print the contents of the canvas? Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
    It is not possible print the contents of the canvas directly.
    
    Instead, abstract out your drawing routines from the canvas,
    so that it only operates on a DC. Call that function from the 
    paint callback, but you can also create a printer-dc% or
    a postscript-dc% and supply that to your function.
