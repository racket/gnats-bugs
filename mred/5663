>Description:
This might be a change request or a support issue,
and not a bug (I hope).  As far as I can see, 
there is no way in MrEd to display a non-rectangular
bitmap, that is, a bitmap with some transparent pixels.
I tried using .gif's with a "transparent" color, and
that doesn't work.  I know how to achieve the effect in
Win32 programming using ROP2 codes, and I don't see
the equivalent with MrEd.
  I certainly hope that I'm missing something and there
is a way to achieve this effect.  I'm teaching a
summer course at UC Irvine for high school students,
and the topic is computer game programmming in Scheme.
My co-teacher is David Kay, who is the major proponent
of Scheme here at Irvine.

 In version 200, you can supply a mask bitmap when drawing. There's not
 yet a way to automatically get a mask bitmap based on a .gif's
 transparent color, though that's planned for the near future.
 Meanwhile, you can create a mask bitmap, if you happen to know the
 backgorund color, by inspecting the pixels of the main bitmap.
 
 The only way in 103 to draw with a transparent background is to use a
 region. In principle, you can do the same thing as for a mask bitmap,
 unioning a bunck of one-pixel rectangular regions. I don't know how
 well it would perform.

 Matthew,
   Thanks for your quick response.  I'll investigate switching
 to version 200.  I had thought of creating a clipping region; if
 I pursue that I'll let you know how it works.
   I had another thought which perhaps is also in 200: a window%'s
 background should be a brush instead of a color.  This would,
 among other things, permit transparent backgrounds, which might
 eliminate some flashing.  (Win32 works this way, of course.)
 
 Thanks,
 
 --Dan
