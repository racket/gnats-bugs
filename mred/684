>Description:

if you do not know the size of the bitmap you need to create for some image,
it is impossible to create an image. (it may or maynot be possible when you 
know the size, I am not sure, since I don't know the sizes)

>How-To-Repeat:

All of these atempts at creating bitmaps give errors:

(make-object wx:bitmap% filename)
(make-object wx:bitmap% filename 'wx:const-bitmap-type-default)
(make-object wx:bitmap% filename wx:const-bitmap-type-default)

 What does the size have to do with anything? You do need to know hte type.

 wx:const-bitmap-type was removed in 53/1; the type must now be
 specified always.

 It's more clear if you look at the possibilities for creating bitmaps.

 Oh, that's the problem.
 
 While we are on the subject, is there any chance a jpeg package will be put 
 into mred sometime?
