>Description:
When creating a one line high editor canvas and making it not stretchable
in the y direction, it is too small. I believe the default font is
10pt courier.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object dialog% "test"))
(define c (make-object editor-canvas% f (make-object text%)))
(send c set-line-count 1)
(send c stretchable-height #f)
(send f show #t) ;; resize frame to a big size.

 The problem is related to the horizontal scrollbar. For some reason,
 the scrollbar doesn't affect the canvas's client size until after the
 canvas is shown. In contrast, the canvas size is correctly computed if
 set-line-count is called after the frame is shown, or if the cannvas
 is created without a horionztal scrollbar.

 Maybe you expected this, but even when I pass no-hscroll or hide-hscroll,
 I still get the wrong size canvas.
