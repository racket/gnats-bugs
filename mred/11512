>Description:
The m: key binding mapping doesn't appear to work under windows. The program below should map alt-up to insert "up" into the editor, but it doesn't. It does seem to map control-up, tho.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui
(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200] [height 200]))
(define t (new text%))
(define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
(define k (new keymap%))
(send t set-keymap k)
(send k add-function "up" (Î» x (send t insert "up")))
(send k map-function "m:up" "up")
(send k map-function "c:up" "up")
(send ec focus)
(send f show #t)
