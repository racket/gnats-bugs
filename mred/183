	A program that executes a tight loop using reads, possibly printfs,
	is extremly difficult to stop. It often runs on after four, five 
	attempts with JustBreak|Kill. One time I had to kill DrS with the 
	task manager.

	(let loop () (let ((ch (read aport))) (printf "~s~n" ch) (loop)))
	make sure aport is bound to file that's empty

I cannot seem to reproduce this one either. It doesn't always die when I
break it, but when I kill it, it dies.

 I tried to reproduce that, but was not able to. It doesn't seem to stop
 when I break it, but when I kill it, it dies.

 I am complaining that I can't "JustBreak". I don't want to kill.
