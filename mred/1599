>Description:
there is a bug in the set-string method of list boxes. Sometimes, this bug
crashes the machine, but in the code below it just puts random junk
into the list box.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 200 200))
(define lb (make-object list-box% #f null f void))
(send lb append "aaa")
(send f show #t)
(send lb set-string 0 "bbb")

 Trivial fix.  To check this, I put an additional button in the 
 list-testing frame of "/tests/mred/item.ss".  Now, this item is kind 
 of a hack, because it changes the names of list items, and the rest 
 of the test frame doesn't expect that; presumably, it keeps track of 
 the names of the items in the list boxes itself, and gets confused 
 when their names change.  For that reason, I have checked in but not 
 exp-tagged that change.  In fact, looking at it, I see that version 
 1.70 was checked in back in June, but never exp-tagged.  So I 
 _definitely_ won't exp-tag the change.  Anyway, more elegant versions 
 of this test are certainly welcome.
 
 Oh yes, the change is to src/wxmac/src/mac/wx_lbox.cc
 
 thanks,
