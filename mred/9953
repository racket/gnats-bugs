>Description:
I just installed DrScheme version 4.1.3.  Once I started the program, it took quite a long time to start (about double the usual start-up time), and then crashed after I entered a few keystrokes into the interactions window.  I tried removing all traces of my previous configuration files (which often cause problems with DrScheme), but the behavior persists.  I had no trouble with 4.1.2.  This is on a Mac Pro computer (64 bit, but can run 32 bit apps without problems).
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Install DrScheme on Mac OS X Leopard from the binary installer.
2) Launch DrScheme and specify the Module language level.
3) Type a few keystrokes into the bottom (interactions) window e.g. (+ 2 2).
4) Shortly after evaluating the previous expression, the window will disappear and the program will no longer be active.

 Apologies for your bad earlier experiences with files from previous
 installations.
 
 If you still have problems and have not reported them to, more detail
 would be welcome.
 
 Regards,
 Robby

 Usually, when a program crashes on the mac a dialog pops up asking if
 you want to report the crash. If you start the reporting process you
 will often get a useful stack trace that you can copy and paste out,
 without actually contacting apple.
 
 I can't think of anything else offhand. FWIW, I use a mac all the time
 and haven't seen that behavior, so there must be something about what
 you're doing or how you're doing it or something that is tickling the
 bug somehow. Sorry I don't have any better ideas.

 Yeah, I've seen the crash dialog too, but it didn't come up in this case.
 
 I'll try starting it from the command-line and seeing if anything
 interesting happens.  Ditto with mzscheme.  I wish I had strace on Mac
 OS X (maybe it's available somewhere).
 
 I also have another Mac (MacBook Pro, not 64-bit), so I'll try it on that.
 
 Mike



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:13 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
