>Description:
This may be fixed in the current CVS code.  If I open a document 
and maximize it, the window resizes, but the content area of the 
window (including the scrollbar) does not change.  If I then resize 
the window using the "drag box" at the corner, it resizes normally 
and the content area refreshes correctly.  While the content area 
is "shrunken", using the scrollbar functions normally, but only 
scrolls the original area, and does not force the entire window 
to resize.  I assume there's a message passed to a window when the 
maximize button is pressed, different from the resize message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open document.
Set window size to smaller than screen size.
Press maximize button on window.
