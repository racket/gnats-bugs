>Description:
I'm trying to test embedded MzScheme within MSVC v5. I followed the procedure for building the libraries and this worked fine. My code compiles also, no warnings or errors. However, when I try to link, I get a bunch of errors like this:

mzsrc.lib(network.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ___WSAFDIsSet@8

Is there another step I need to take? Will the libraries link properly only under MSVC v6?
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make libraries under MSVC v5.
2. Write a simple program to take arbitrary Scheme code and evaluate it.
3. Try to compile and link the program.

 James,

 I think you need to link against the WinSock library, WSOCK32.LIB, 
 as well as the MzScheme and GC libraries.  I do this for MzCOM,
 which contains an embedded MzScheme.
 
 I don't believe this is mentioned in the docs, although it should be.
