>Description:
It seems the MrEd executable in the FreeBSD kit
wasn't compiled with the right options:

Undefined symbol "scheme_wrong_type"

The MzScheme binary from the same kit does not
have that problem.

I'm recompiling right now to maybe find out what
exactly is going on.

Try to load any extension.

 Indeed, compiling with
 
 LDENDERS = -export-dynamic
 
 cures the problem.

 I probably forgot to link mred with the -rdynamic flag. It doesn't show
 up in my current Make.env for FreeBSD, which is a strong indicator.
