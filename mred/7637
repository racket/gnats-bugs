 FWIW, I've seen this bug (or a similar looking one) in 400 as well. I
 sent Matthew file.

 Yes, my students are beginning to claim we have this bug in .400, too. 
 Charlotte removed.

 I heard stories that seem suspicious, but so far after an
 investigation it all turned out as 299.200.  Actually, this bug can be
 a good candidate for a 299.400 bug since Charlotte already reported
 one.  (PR all/7603)

 Just to be clear, Charlotte, the question is whether the file could
 possibly have been *saved* in 299.200, as opposed to whether it fails
 to open in a particular version. The known bug is in saving files with
 299.200.
 
 So far, no one has provided a sequence of steps that generates a bad
 file in 299.400 --- though we'd certainly like to know, if you have
 one. Some users have thought that they got bad files out of 299.400,
 but in cases that we've investigated thoroughly, it seems more likely
 that they were just confused about the version being used. (Version
 confusion is quite understandable, given the short time and small
 changes between the 299.200 and 299.400 releases.)
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew

 Today my students and I took some time trying to recreate the problem.  We have the 400 version installed and these were newly created files.  Commenting out with a box almost always caused the file opening error.  Commenting out with semicolons did not.

 I just sat down with a student here, who also said that she had a
 problem when using comment boxes, but we could not reproduce it.  Do
 you have an actual text file where commenting some part of it
 generates the problem?

 Attached is a file for you.  I can generate the error by commenting out =
 the first line.
 
 I think I might have learned something that will help. =20
 I created the attached file by typing a few lines and then copying them =
 and pasting them back into the file.
 I just created a similar file by simply typing all the lines.  And =
 commenting out with a box in that file does not cause the opening error.
 
 I know my students have been using the cut and paste functions too.

 Thanks! It would have taken much longer to find the bug without your
 help. Even so, I nearly missed the bug by not following your directions
 closely enough.
 
 
 Naturally, the bug is related to state. DrScheme overrides the
 `on-save-file' method to change the save format stored with an editor,
 but MrEd computes the "actual" save format (from the editor's state)
 before calling `on-save-file'. The "actual" save format is later
 ignored as another method looks up the format again through editor's
 state --- seeing the format set by by `on-save-file'. So two parts of
 the save process see different format settings. Finally, after saving,
 MrEd installs the "actual" format into the editor's state, which erases
 any record of the discrepancy (and ensures that the problem continues
 if the file is saved again).
 
 The bug is easily fixed by computing the "real" format after calling
 `on-save-file'.
 
 The 299.400 bug is somewhat rarer than the 299.200 bug. In 299.400, the
 file must be opened as text in DrScheme, and then it must be changed
 from text to non-text before saving. When edits are saved for a file
 that is originally opened as non-text, there's no bug. Similarly,
 there's no problem when starting a new file from scratch in DrScheme,
 even if the file is saved as text before saving it as non-text (but a
 new file can be corrupted by saving as text, closing, opening again,
 changing to non-text, then saving).
 
 Most likely, we had trouble reproducing the bug because we never
 started by opening an existing text file. (Instead, I always tried
 starting with a new file, which works fine.)
 
 It turns out that the bug is partly visible on non-Windows platforms.
 On other platforms, the saved file is not corrupted, but an immediate
 "Revert" loads the binary content as text.
 
 Fixed in SVN for the next release.

 Charlotte, I would like to thank you for the patience you showed with 
 DrScheme.
 
 It is rare that such problems persist with DrScheme and even rarer that 
 a teacher can spend the time helping us. If, as I believe you have 
 never taken a TeachScheme! course, send me a postal address and I'll 
 send you a copy of HtDP with a signature. That of course just decreases 
 the value because you can't re-sell it but I'd like to thank you in 
 some way :-)
 
 Let's turn 299.xyz into 300 soon so that students can use a stable 
 version again.
