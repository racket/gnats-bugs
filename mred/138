access violation is

"The instruction at 0x0040f219 referenced memory at 0x0000001c.  The memory could not be read"


>How-To-Repeat:
Click on underlined mred or drscheme to get the about box.
under mred you get a simple access violation (and mred goes away) while under drscheme you get the additional message in a window titled standard output:

wx:media-edit%::insert: expected arg of type <character>;  given  #<procedure> (type <procedure>)

State-Changed-When: Thu May 29 12:02:43 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The access violation was caused by the use of setjmp instead of
scheme_setjmp in some of the wxWindows Scheme<->C++ glue. A repaired
binary has been released.

The error that only showed up in DrScheme is actually
platform-independent and also occurs in MrEd (and unlikely to be a
problem in mredengine), so I have re-submitted that portion of the bug
report.
