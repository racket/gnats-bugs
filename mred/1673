>Description:
In priciple, an empty list box and an empty editor canvas
with no horizontal scroll bars should look and behave identically.

In MrEd, however, there are several two differences
(listed in order of importance):

  - the list box has a few extra pixels (more than it
    needs for the highlight) of blank space around it
    The editor canvas does not.

  - the list-box draws a highlight around it when it 
    has the focus. The editor canvas does not.

Run the code below to see these differences in action.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define hp (make-object horizontal-panel% f))
(make-object editor-canvas% hp #f '(no-hscroll))
(make-object list-box% #f null hp void '(single))
(send f show #t)

Reason>>> In the v299 series, use the 'control-border style and use
2 for horiz-margin and vert-margin,
and then they're the same.
