>Release:        unknown
>Environment:
	doesn't matter
>Description:
	Hitting Ctl-C in MrEd when breaking is not allowed saves the break
	until breaking is allowed, even across separate interactions in the
	console.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Start MrEd. Hit Ctl-C (nothing happens). Eval 10 (10 is printed).
	Eval (let loop () (loop)) - user break occurs (due to the original
	Ctl-C).
>Fix:
	Flush queued breaks when a new prompt is presented?

I just tried this again, on May 28.
Now I can't get Ctl-C to break anything in mred.
