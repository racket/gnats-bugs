>Description:
All mutiply getter sends such as "(send event get-position)" cause a crash from on-scroll when called subsequentially.

No instructions in between were inserted.
Was only tested with manual scrollbars.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define my-canvas%
  (class canvas% 
    (define/override (on-scroll event)
      ((lambda (event)
         ;(display (send event get-event-type)) ; Each one does NOT produce a crash
         ;(display (send event get-direction)) ; But 2 at once do
         (display (send event get-position)) ; Uncommenting any of the above would trigger
         )
       event))
    (super-new)))
(define frame (new frame% [label "Blergh"]
                   [width 256]
                   [height 256]))
(define canvas
  (new my-canvas%
     [parent frame]
     [style '(hscroll vscroll)]
))

Reason>>> Thanks for the report!

I believe the crash here is triggered not by the `send`s but
by printing. The `on-scroll` method is incorrectly called in
atomic mode, and printing (especially within DrRacket) can
trigger synchronization that isn't allowed in atomic mode.

Commit b882281b33 in the "gui-lib" package's repository
repairs the call to `on-scroll` so that it's not in atomic
mode. Meanwhile, I hope you can avoid the bug by avoiding
printing during `on-scroll`.
