>Description:
The tab-panel% widget can break under certain circumstances under GTK.
In particular, the set-selection method appears to be broken somehow.

Attached below is some code that will show the failure. On Windows and
Mac (which we tested), it will display a window with some tabs inside.
On Linux/GTK, it will show a blank window and output a GTK error.

This is a problem because DrRacket's "Install .plt file" menu item will
also trigger this bug (type any string into the file field in the install
dialog, close the dialog, and open it again).
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require framework
         racket/gui)

(define frame (new frame% [label "Test"]))

(define (update tp _2)
  (define sel (send tp get-selection))
  (send swap active-child
        (if (zero? sel) f1 f2)))

(define tabs
  (new tab-panel% 
       [parent frame]
       [callback update]
       [choices (list "1" "2")]))

(define swap (new panel:single% [parent tabs]))

(define f1
  (new text-field%
       [parent swap]
       [callback void]
       [init-value ""]
       [label "F1"]))

(define f2
  (new text-field%
       [parent swap]
       [callback void]
       [init-value "Something"]
       [label "F2"]))

(send frame show #t)
(send swap active-child f1)
;; this next line is the problem
(send tabs set-selection 1)
