>Description:

My students have had problems using DrScheme on our brand-new
G3 Macs.  The machines have enough memory to start up and
run Dr. Scheme, and for a while there were no problems.  But
in the past few weeks it has started to crash on them
unexpectedly in the middle of their work, sometimes giving 
an "out of memory" error.  If they try to restart the program,
sometimes it would give the error immediately.

I've noticed recent problems with it as well, when doing demos
in class.  If I try to open a text file that wasn't created
with DrScheme, it frequently crashes *the first time* and
must be restarted.  Also, starting it up from an alias or
by double-clicking on a file created by DrScheme seems to lead
to it crashing.  

Is it possible that there is a memory allocation problem
somewhere in the Mac version?  I haven't noticed any problems
on other platforms.

Thanks,

Susan Fox
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is intermittent, but:

Start up Dr. Scheme.
Select Open, and choose a text file not created by Dr Scheme

(This has recently caused DrScheme to shut down immediately,
but only the first time the open is attempted.

 There is definitely a bug in starting DrScheme by double-clicking a
 file. Dragging a file onto the "MrEd" icon while DrScheme is running
 is also buggy. These problems have been fixed for the next release.
 
 We have not seen crashes when starting DrScheme via an alias. To make
 sure we understand: you create an alias for the DrScheme launcher, and
 double-clicking that alias causes DrScheme to crash?
 
 In general, DrScheme *does* have memory problems on the Mac that don't
 exist on other platforms. Mostly to blame is DrScheme's huge appetite
 for memory, but the MacOS's poor memory architecture aggravates the
 problem.  There doesn't seem to be much we can do to work around the
 OS problems. (In particular, when you get an out-of-memory error
 immediately after restarting a crashed DrScheme, it's essentially a
 problem with the Mac's memory architecture; the OS isn't able to
 clean-up from the crash.)
 
 We can offer one possible solution. If your machine has more memory,
 try increasing DrScheme's initial memory partition. Open the "Get
 Info" dialog for MrEd (not the DrScheme launcher) to give DrScheme
 more memory; give it as much as possible.
 
 Otherwise, if you've already maxed out the partition size, there's not
 much that we can do at this point. Rest assured that we are trying to
 decrease DrScheme's memory use, and each release is a little more
 compact than the previous one.

 The initial partition for mred is too small. When I use that partition size 
 I can only edit a few files in *mred* before crashing.
 
 Since we now have "real" consumers complaining and not just me, perhaps now 
 we can increase the default partition size for mred?

 It sounds like something is more seriously wrong. Do you know what the
 initial partition size is?

 Yes, but it also sounds like this is wrong.

 You're closer :)
 
 I believe that it is around 20 megabytes. Reasonable for small to medium 
 use of mred and small use of drscheme (in 53).
 
 I don't suppose that setup-plt can check the amount of memory on the 
 machine and change the partition size of the installed mred and mzscheme? I 
 guess that's asking a lot :)

 min 14000 preferred 24000. 14000 is _way_ too small.

I guess the partition size was the problem. Once DrScheme 100 is
running, we need to adjust the partition size.

Looks like the regular partition size is good for DrScheme 100.
