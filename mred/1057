>Description:
I get the dreaded "error type 2" dialog when I double-click on DrScheme,
DrScheme Jr, or mzc.  I've done all the usual things (checked available
memory, checked for system extension conflicts, etc.) but I can't get
past this.

As a last resort I'm downloading the m68k version to see if that will
work in emulation mode.

 I notice that "MzScheme" and "MrEd" are not in the list above. Is that
 because they work?
 
 The DrScheme, DrScheme Jr, and mzc lauchers are actually 68k
 applications that start the MrEd/MzScheme PPC binaries. So the problem
 may actually have something to do with running 68k programs (although
 we've never heard of such a problem before).

 Well, they start up but immediately quit with other errors.  MzScheme dies with
 an error box saying "InterfaceLib-DialogItemText could not be found".  MrEd dies
 with "InterfaceLib-ers could not be found".  I'm guessing that finding these
 libraries probably depends upon setup information provided by the launchers.

 I'm able to run other 68k programs, just not these.  I'll keep digging...

 No, they should start up directly. The launchers probably crash because
 MzScheme and MrEd won't start.
 
 Maybe InterfaceLib is a code fragment that the system is supposed to
 provide. Robby or John: do you have a file named "InterfaceLib" (or
 something like that) on your machine?
