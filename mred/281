MS Windows 95
>Description:
When File/Print Definitions selected, a Windows GPF ensues.  Error message 
states: "This program has performed an illegal operation...." Title bar 
associates error with MrEd. File/Print Interactions works perfectly.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have yet to get any other results.  Whether I have a program in the 
definitions buffer or not I still get the error.  Try just starting Mr.
Scheme and choose File/Print Definitions with just an empty buffer -- that
does it for me.

 This bug has been fixed, and version "50" of DrScheme for Windows was
 re-released. You can download DrScheme from the usual web site.  The
 only change in the distribution archive plt.exe is a new mred.exe.
 
 Thanks for the bug report,
 Matthew
