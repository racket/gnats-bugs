>Description:
If you instantiate a message% object whose label contains 
a newline, only the first line shows up under Windows.

Under Unix/X, all lines show up.


>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "foo"))


(define panel (instantiate vertical-panel% () 

                               (parent frame)))



(define msg (format "~a~n~a~n" "foo" "bar"))



(instantiate message% () 

  (label msg) (parent panel))


(send frame show #t)

; in Unix, you see "foo" and "bar", in Windows, just "foo"
