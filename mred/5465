>Description:
I plan to add menu-key-plus and menu-key-minus as shortcuts
for going to the next and previous windows, but the plus
key as a menu shortcut doesn't seem to work out.

I'd like that <menu-key>-equal be the same as <menu-key>-plus
since plus is the shifted version of equal. That seems standard,
but I'm not sure. IE has command-tilde and it works when I type
command-backquote (which is the unshifted form of tilde on my
keyboard).

Anyways, I'm happy if this is a platform-specific thing, since it
seems like MacOS is already doing something to find the shortcut
(witness'd by item 4. below)


>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. run the code below
;; 2. type command-minus and see printouts.
;; 3. type command-equal and see nothing
;; 4. type command-shift-equal (aka command-plus)
;;     and see the menu bar flash, but no callback

(module m mzscheme
  (require (lib "class.ss")
           (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
  (define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 400 400))
  (define mb (make-object menu-bar% f))
  (define m (make-object menu% "menu" mb))
  (define mi1 (make-object menu-item% "one" m (lambda x (display x) (newline)) #\+))
  (define mi2 (make-object menu-item% "two" m (lambda x (display x) (newline)) #\-))
  (send f show #t))
