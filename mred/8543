>Description:
I have been working with scheme in the "pretty big" language and have run into a devious bug.  It took me quite a few hours to solve this one:  When using a non-monochromatic image as the mask in a draw-bitmap-section DC call the mask works as expected.  However, when making subsequent calls with the mask and drawing different pieces of the same picture, the first src-x & src-y parameters are used and the given src-x & src-y parameters are ignored.  Also, I believe that changing the src-width & src-height parameters make the draw fail (nothing is drawn).
I found this bug while trying to draw an animation where all the frames of the animation were sequenced on one bitmap.  When I added a mask image to give the animation non-uniform edges the frames wouldn't advance!  I tried tweaking every parameter in many ways but nothing changed until I got to the mask parameter.  Once unmasked, the animation worked fine.  The mask was colored but only contained the colors black and white.
I finally resolved this bug by writing a method that took an image and spat out a monochrome version of that image.  I simply passed the mask through the converter at initialization, and the animation animated fine.
While searching on google I found a textfile with versioning fixes for drscheme.  One of the fixes mentioned adding support for colored bitmaps as masks.  This pointed me towards the colored/monochromatic solution and it turned out to be right!

Thanks very much for tracking down the
problem!
