>Description:
I downloaded the plt-300-bin-i36-linux-ubuntu510.sh file to use DrScheme v300 on my Ubuntu box. However, when I ran the IDE, the fonts were readable, but *very* ugly. For some reason, DrScheme was only picking up the bitmap fonts, not the TrueType fonts - and unusually large, too. Also, smoothing was not working.

I downloaded the source tarball and compiled it, and everything worked fine, and my bits worked fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme. Watch observe fonts for IDE (menus, dialogs) and code authoring area.
