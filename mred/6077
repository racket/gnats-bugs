>Description:
Tools don't seem to receive "moving?" events when you move
the mouse in DrScheme's definitions window, after having
switched to DrScheme from another virtual screen (see
below for details on how to make that happen).

I first noticed this while working on MrFlow: the
overriden on-event method of the definitions window was
not called when the mouse was moving.  Then I noticed
the same problem occured with Check Syntax.  It still
occurs even after updating my cvs tree, recompiling
everything from scratch and not loading MrFlow or
python.  The cause must be a recent change somewhere
because it was working correctly a little while ago.

I haven't tried with a window manager other than fvwm2,
but as far as I can tell I don't have any problem with
any other application and the binary for fvwm2 hasn't
changed in almost a year.

>How-To-Repeat:
Open a file in Drscheme

Click on the "Check syntax" button and wait for the
analysis to be done.  Move the mouse around and look
at the nice arrows being drawn.

Switch to another virtual screen using your favorite
window manager (e.g. fvwm2).

Switch back to the virtual screen where DrScheme is,
in such a way that the mouse ends up right in the middle
of the definitions window (e.g. I position my mouse at
the right place on the screen, then use a keyboard
shortcut to switch virtual screen)

Move the mouse around: nothing happens, no arrows are
drawn where they should be drawn (in the case of MrFlow
I actually added a printf in my code and it showed that
on-event was not called even though moving the mouse was
presumably still generating "moving?" events somewhere).

Everything works fine again as soon as the mouse leaves
the definitions window proper and back (e.g. moving the
cursor over the button bar at the top) or you click a
mouse button.

Any possibility of checking?
