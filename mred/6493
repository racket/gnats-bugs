 Specify a suitable radius, and it will draw correctly.
 
 The current default radius is 20 --- which doesn't make any sense.
 Probably the default should change to -0.25. Also, the method could use
 some checking to ensure that a reasonable value is provided (i.e.,
 between -0.5 and half of the smallest dimension).

 Is it possible to have a dc-independent semantics for the radius? 20
 looks fine in a macos x canvas.

 Yes --- in 205, MrEd will reject out-of-bounds radius values with a
 mismatch exception.

 Oh, I see -- the default was funny even for canvases?
