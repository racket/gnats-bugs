>Environment:
MS Windows 95
>Description:
A modal window (like the file dialog) inhibits *all* DrScheme
windows, not just the one from which the dialog was launched.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run DrScheme.
Create a new DrScheme with File | New.
Try to Save As the second DrScheme.
The windows task switcher has only one PLT icon, and you cannot
access the first DrScheme (which may contain a filename that
the second DrScheme's contents must be saved under).

 I do not think that this will be fixed soon. Sorry. There are some
 technical problems, relating to eventspaces and modal dialogs (discussd
 very briefly in our paper)

Responsible-Changed-Why:

I am moving this to you, Matthew, because of the meeting. We think that the 
best thing is to provide for some way to make the modal dialog always
esaily available. For example, if a window in the eventspace with the modal 
dialog comes to the front, the modal dialog hops up in front of it or
something like that. What do you think?
