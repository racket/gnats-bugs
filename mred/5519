>Description:
The .bmp and .gif formats allow you to specify a transparent color, however, the bitmap% class does not seem to support getting or using it.  There is currently no way to efficiently draw a bitmap with transparent regions to a display context.  I've gotten around the problem by building a mask bitmap from an existing one.  However, this has a number of problems:

1.  It requires me to know the rgb value for the transparent color (but even if I know the value, there's another problem altogether as .bmp files, for instance, usually specify a pallete at the beginning of the file and use indices into this table to describe the image.  One index is the transparent color, but another index may have the same rgb values as the transparent so that you can have pixels of the transparent color show up)

2.  I have to have two bitmaps sitting around for every image I wish to blt to the screen.

3.  Because the mask has to be monochrome, I can't store it to a file for use later (the documentation does not suggest a way to force a bitmap read from a file to be monochrome instead of color), so I have to generate the masks from scratch each time I run my program.

Suggestion:
(send dc<%> draw-bitmap bitmap% x y type color mask)
should take a color instead of a mask.  That would fix 2 and 3.

I can get around 1 by making my transparent color be white in all my images, but it would be nice if that information was readily available via the bitmap object.

State-Changed-Why:
    As of version 201, loading a bitmap from disk will
    optionally generate a mask bitmap for GIF files
    based on the transparent pixel value indicated in the
    89a file format.
    
    As far as I can tell, there's actually no indication
    of a transparent color in the BMP format. Am I wrong
    about that?
    
    Thanks,

State-Changed-Why:
    v203 will support loading .gif files in a way that
    produces a mask bitmap to go with the main bitmap.
    (Actually, the feature was in v202, but due to a bug
    in the distribution, the mask was inaccessible.) 
    
    When I last looked into this, I couldn't find a
    transparent-color attribute in a BMP file. I'm
    willing to be corrected, though, if you can clue
    me in.
