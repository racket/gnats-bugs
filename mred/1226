 For the next release, I've fixed move-position for moves to the right:
 it'll draw the caret at the end of the line for an ambigous position.
 That behavior probably got lost in the recent changes to move-position
 for non-empty selections.
 
 Note that you can get to the end-of-line position by keyboard
 navigation in the current release: move four characters into the
 "aaa..." line and type an up arrow.
 
 New wx_media.cxx committed and exp-tagged.

 So, when you move right to the "ambiguous" position, another right
 move will move you where? Past the first character on the next line?
 It seems like there should actually be two caret positions and moving
 right should move through both of them. Of course, I realize this
 takes (large?) changes to mred, so perhaps it is not feasible.
