>Description:
moving click/press within list-box, generates too may events, and appears to cause standard-output to open displaying interaction window overflow?
>How-To-Repeat:
; begin: list-box-event-bug.ss
; using language Graphical mzscheme, open this file in Definitions frame, then press Execute;
; then move cursor rapidly while click/pressed within the empty space below list; events should
; be displayed within the interactive window, but occasionally the Standard Output window comes
; up, also displaying these events for some reason, which it shouldn't?
; [actually multiple "#f list-box" events are generated, where I would have only expected one   ]
; [upon the release of the click/press, just as occurs if initially click/pressed witin a valid ]
; [list entry; so there may actually be two problems; 1-the standard-output displaying upon many]
; [events, 2-the continious generation of "#f list-box" events. Thanks for your help.           ]

(require (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))

(define my-frame (instantiate frame% ("frame" #f 200 300)))

(define (my-selection list-box control-event)

 Hi Matthew, etal.
 
 While fooling around with the use of the list-box within DrScheme to
 try to eliminate some of the anomalies referenced in this bug report,
 at the scheme level; I noticed that the latest version of A-List is 1.2,
 which from it's version history, seems to tweaked some things having to
 do with Carbon events, but don't know if it would specifically help with
 some of these or other Mac event idiosyncrasies, might be worth a look?
 
 (and as an aside, although Dr/MzScheme is now much more stable, I had
  also noticed that Boehm's GC seems to have stabilized at v6.1, which
  seems to be still used for the Mac, but don't know if it's worth
  updating to it, if you're planning to standardize on the use of 3m on
  the Mac platform in the near future?)
 
 Hopefully helpful observations, but I know that the PLT team has more
 than their hands full; thanks again,
 
 -paul-

 FWIW, as of the end of my custodianship of the mac code, we were using 
 a stock A-List.  The only change we needed was to disable the use of 
 UpdateAllControls(), and Kyle Hammond graciously added a compile flag 
 to handle this.  This suggests that were we to upgrade, the change 
 might be relatively painless.

 Sorry, for the earlier miss-information, apparently Hans just recently
 released gc6.2a1, which claims a few Mac OSX specific bug fixes.
