>Description:
Hi.
I am using a MacBook with an Intel core duo, and Mac OSX 10.4.7.
The keyboard shortcuts does not work in drscheme.
Every time I try some shortcut (starting with the "command-key") the only visible result is as if I had typed the question-mark.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install DrScheme, version 352 (newest as far as I know) on a macbook with an intel processor and Mac OSX 10.4.7.
Try the shortcuts.
(I dont know if this problem is only related to this kond of computer, but this is what I use.)

Reason>>> This bug has been fixed for our next release.
The bug affects DrScheme when certain non-U.S.
keyboard configurations are used.

Thanks for the report,
Matthew

 We have not yet set a date for the next release.
 
 If you'd like to try a snapshot of the latest, you can find it here:
 
    http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/
 
 New snapshots are taken daily. Obviously, since this is a snapshot of
 our live development version, things are more likely to go wrong with a
 snapshot than with an official release, but most snapshots are in good
 shape.
