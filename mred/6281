>Description:
Looks like the following program which works fine
under Linux with "mred -u", and also workd fine from
DrScheme, gets hanged after the file dialog is done
when it is used with "mred.exe -u" or made into an
executable.

Usually it just disappears, but I think that sometimes it
will continue after a really long delay (more than 10
minutes).

Also, if the `printf' is uncommented, it also works fine
since the standard output window is opened.

This behavior looks consistent with Windows 2000 and
with Windows running on a termserver.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try this program with "mred -u":

(module y mzscheme
  (require (lib "mred.ss" "mred"))
  ;(printf ">>>1\n")
  (message-box "FOO" "FOO1" #f '(ok))
  (get-file-list "Please select JPG files" #f #f #f "jpg" '()
                 '(("JPEG Files" "*.jpg") ("Any" "*.*")))
  (message-box "FOO" "FOO2" #f '(ok))
)

    Fixed in 205.8. This turned out not to be a deep
    bug related to the mysterious ways of the Windows
    message queue, as I had expected, but instead a simple
    signalling problem.
