 I forgot to mention that this bug is `robust', in the sense that if you
 widen the window and add a few spaces before the first line (then re-tab
 the second), the problem occurs again.

 Known bug in word-break finder (no PR so far) that I didn't get time to
 fix. Thanks for the PR.

State-Changed-Why:

I mis-diagnosed the bug. Although I've fixed the wordbreak bug, it
doesn't seem to apply to the above case (no wordbreak spans > 30
chars).

Can you tell me more about the bug, i.e., what the wrong wrapping is
and why it's wrong. (Since I don't have a Mac, I can't simply follow
the instructions to see what a bad wrap looks like.)

In case there's any question, the wrapping is supposed to work as
follows:

 * If the window is wide enough, there should be no wrapping.

 * As soon as the window becomes too narrow, the line will be wrapped
   just before xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (because MrEd wraps on
   word boundaries whenever possible).

 I understand this bug better now, and I can cause it on any platform.  The
 problem is that words which begin exactly 19 characters before the end of
 the line are considered by the word-wrapper to be a part of the previous
 word.
 
 Example:
 
 suppose my drscheme definitions window is 92 characters wide, the default
 on northamerica for me.  Let's call this number w, for width.  First, put
 at least one word in this line --- say, the word 'xxx' between 1:24 and
 1:27.  Now, starting at character (w - 18), type 19 x's.  In my window,
 this word stretches from position 1:64 to 1:93.  now type one more x.  You
 should see the wrap occur _before_ the first word on the line; in our case,
 at position 1:24.
 
 Let me know if this doesn't work for you.

 29, not 19 (thanks for including detailed instructions). I see the bug,
 and I see what's wrong in the code.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
