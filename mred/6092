>Description:
if you watch the USER object and GDI object count for DrScheme with Task Manager under Windows XP, it seems like there are some leaks.  For example, when you go to edit->preferences, switch to every tab in the dialog, and then dismiss it, the USER object count stays about 100 objects higher than before entering the preferences dialog.

 That's not a leak. Even though the dialog isn't visible, it still
 exists. The USER count shouldn't go up when you select
 edit->preferences again.
 
 There's definitely some imprecision in window clean-up, partly due to
 conservative GC. For example, if you open 5 DrScheme windows and close
 them all, not all 5 windows get reliably collected. But it's unlikely
 that more than a few windows stick around at any given time.

 I notice that IE is better than DrScheme, but not orders of magnitude.
 If I open 9 IE windows, IE needs 600 USER handles (compared to
 DrScheme's 1060).
 
 On the whole, for USER objects, I doubt that there's much else than GC
 imprecision and complex DrScheme windows. Hopefully the move toward 3m
 will happen soon, and hopefully it will help.
 
 GDI counts skyrocket when a program makes lots of mutable pens/brushes,
 instead of getting immutable pens/brushes from the-pen/brush-list.
 Probably MrEd should add an intermediate layer so that mutable objects
 actually share underlying Windows objects; I've been meaning to do that
 for years. Meanwhile, it's possible that other things contribute to the
 GDI problem; I haven't yet looked closely.

 Is there any chance that this stuff causes a printer problem on Win 98?

 There are three places left in DrScheme where pen objects are created;
 one is in the preferences dialog for the profiling band of color; one
 is in the profiling code to draw the profiling colors on the text and
 the last is in the framework for the highlighting colors (one per
 text:basic%).
 
 I tried to remove the last one, but I find that find-or-create-pen is
 returning #f even tho it is being passed a color% object. When I call
 find-or-create-pen with the same arguments by itself it returns a pen.
 I'm not sure why it would return #f and I'm not sure how to narrow this
 down. I do notice that if I create a new color% object with the same
 rgb values as the original color% object, find-or-create-pen is not
 returning #f for that new color% object.
 
 This is on line 289 in plt/collects/framework/text.ss.

 I can't find a way for find-or-create-pen to return #f given a color%
 object.
 
 This is under Mac OS X? Is code checked in, and can you tell me how to
 generate the #f myself?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 This was happening on my mac at home; I just got in to the office and
 put the same code into the framework and the problem doesn't happen,
 so I'm not sure what is going on.
 
 I reboot when I get home tonight...

 Well, I've eliminated all of the pens and brushes direct object
 creation I can find in drscheme, in favor of the find-or-create methods
 in the pen and brush lists.
 
 There are still more in slideshow, waterworld, the games collection,
 and other places like that, but I'd be curious to know if this object
 count that was originally mentioned in this PR has gone down with the
 latest code.
 
 Note: if you have a b/w monitor, drscheme still creates many pens. 
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
