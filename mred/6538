>Description:
Dear Sir, Mam,

congragulatioons to your team on creating something which is so complex, 
to appear so simple and effortless for all of us.  I wanted to point out 
somethings that I had noticed in using the PLT program.

In using the PLT Scheme (ver. 205) on Mac OSX (ver. 10.2.3 - Panther),
I am unable to choose any fonts other than Courier or Monaco from the 
preferences.  The other fonts listed appear as non-readable characters.

Also, but very minor, the help window does not resize properly when using the 
'+' button within the title-bar.

My computer is a G5 PowerMac (dual G5) with 512 MB memory.


Thank You,
Vikas.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Choose 'Preferences' from DrScheme menu.
2. choose 'Fonts' tab from the Preferences screen.
3. Select a font other than Courier or Monaco.

it.
