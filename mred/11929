>Description:
When a bitmap% is created by loading a png file, get-argb-pixels writes only alpha values 0 and 255 to the given byte buffer.

The loaded mask is perfectly fine. Though weird, it provides a workaround for now.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require racket/gui rackunit)

; create a bitmap with a range of alpha values
(define bm (make-object bitmap% 10 10 #f #t))
(define dc (make-object bitmap-dc% bm))
(send dc draw-text "O" 0 0)

; save it as png, load it again
(send bm save-file "test.png" 'png)
(define bm* (make-object bitmap% "test.png" 'png/mask #f))

; get bm alpha bytes
(define bs (make-bytes (* 4 10 10)))
(send bm get-argb-pixels 0 0 10 10 bs #t)

; get bm* alpha bytes
(define bs* (make-bytes (* 4 10 10)))
(send bm* get-argb-pixels 0 0 10 10 bs* #t)

; this fails, but shouldn't:
(check-equal? bs bs*)

 Unless I'm missing something, it's as intended (and, yes, weird).
 
 Use 'png/alpha to load a PNG file to a bitmap with an alpha channel
 instead of a mask bitmap.
 
 Better, use the more modern `read-bitmap', which has the right default.
