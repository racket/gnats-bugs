>Description:
I can start MrEd PPC.  I can start the Help Desk.  I can start the Games.
  
  But when I start DrScheme, it will either lockup the whole machine (cursor will not move), or screw up the fonts (requiring a restart of the machine).
  
  The splash screen which shows the progress bar completes.  The app will either lock when the bar reaches 100%, or it may continue a pop up windows, but with the fonts hosed.  The fonts appear to be resized down to a very small point size(like 1 pt).  Obviously all menus, etc. are not working either.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download v101
         Then, unpack
         Run "Setup PLT"
         Start DrScheme application

 Figured out a fix.  Some Mac apps don't like it when more than 128 fonts or
 font suitcases are in the System Folder:Fonts folder.
 
 Removing fonts so that I had less than 128 seems to have fixed the
 crash/lockups for now.
 
 Cordially

 You're right... this is a major problem.  However, I run DrScheme 
 every day under OS 9 with no problems, so I'll need more information 
 from you.
 
 My first question is whether this problem occurs with extensions 
 disabled.  If you hold down the <shift> key while booting, the mac 
 will start with all extensions disabled, and you'll see a message to 
 this effect during startup.  Apologies if you know all this already. 
 In any case, I'd like to know whether this solves the problem.
 
 Second ... well, second we get into drastic measures like asking you 
 to install MacsBug, or something like that.  So let's wait on that.
 
 Oh... one other thing.  Does the amount of memory allocated to MrEd 
 affect the problem? Okay, let me back up and explain one thing: when 
 you double-click on the DrScheme icon, you're actually starting up 
 the MrEd application, with some runtime arguments.  So, to increase 
 the amount of memory available to DrScheme, try increasing the memory 
 for MrEd.  The memory you allocate to DrScheme is irrelevant.
 
 Let me know if you figure anything out,

 Reducing the number of fonts in System Folder:Fonts to less than 128 seems
 to have completely fixed the problem.
