>Description:
The summary says it all I believe. I'm on a Titanium Powerbook G4.
>How-To-Repeat:

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:48:14 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
