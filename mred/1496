>Description:
	While actively editing a program of about fifty lines in the
definitions window, one of my students encountered what was reported
as a division-by-zero error.  The error occurred immediately after
the student positioned the cursor (with a mouse click).

	The procedure being edited was not syntactically correct Scheme
-- it contained a string literal that with no closing double quote.
The student was attempting to move the cursor just to the right of
a right parenthesis immediately to the right of this defective string
literal.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Although the student demonstrated the problem for me twice, I have
not been able to reconstruct the context well enough to reproduce it --
sorry.

>Fix:

 I believe this problem:
 
 a) was my fault, and
 b) has been fixed for 102.
 
 In particular, this is a failure of the color-matching code (!) that is trying 
 to find a good highlight color for a syntactic error.  Mea Culpa.
 
 Thanks,
 
 john
