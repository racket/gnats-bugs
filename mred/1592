>Description:
When pasting, then deleting, an output buffer, MrEd
seg faults.
>How-To-Repeat:
The code I use is

  (+ 1 'foo)
  (write 3)

I then copy all this text -- including output buffer,
once also including the unmodifiable text after the
prompt --, then proceed lower into the buffer and type
 
  (define exp

after which I paste all this stuff.  When I delete the
text, I sometimes get a seg fault from MrEd.

If I come up with a more accurate characterization, I'll
submit it.  I just tried to repeat the experiment and
failed, but it did happen twice in a row, the second time
in a *fresh* MrEd (so it's unlikely it was a memory
or other problem).

 I'm probably being dense, but I don't understand the instructions (not
 well enough to get a seg fault, at least). Some clarifications that
 might help me:
 
 Where do you use those two expressions? In the interactions window?
 
 What is an "output buffer"? The box with purple text that `(write 3)'
 produces?
 
 What is "all this text"? Part of the content of the interactions
 window?
 
 Does "lower in the buffer" mean "at the current evaluation prompt"?
 
 By "delete", you mean using the Delete/Backspace key to unpaste?
 
 Thanks for the clarifications,
 Matthew

 All in the Interactions window.

 Correct.  I didn't know what else to call it.

 All of the content from after the first prompt, down to the prompt
 where I am about to type -- ie, two input+output pairs.

 Correct.  The third expression.

 No.  I pasted it, then realized I had pasted the wrong text (I had
 selected something else earlier), so I went to the prompt and hit C-k
 a few times.
 
 Sorry about that -- I was rushing out yesterday dealing with the
 move.  If I can reproduce it, I'll try to grab a screen shot.

 Aha -- that's the trick.
 
 It's probably something to do with auto-line-wrapping editor content.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

Fixed for 103/2.

The bug would manifest itself when snips are deleted from a line
created by autowrapping, leaving nothing on a line except a newline.
As a result, the newline should be folded back into the preceeding
line, but the autowrapper would only do half the work: it would get
rid of the auto-wrap newline, but not delete the line record and move
up the newline. At this point, the editor structure is corrupt (i.e.,
important invariants do not hold).
