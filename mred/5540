>Description:
Immediately after launching DrScheme from the Finder on
Mac OS X (10.1.5), selecting the "Preferences" item from the "Edit"
menu causes DrScheme to immediately close. Mac OS X then displays
the standard "The application DrScheme has unexpectedly quit"
message box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Launch DrScheme from the Finder by double clicking on the DrScheme
icon. Select the "Edit" menu, scroll down to the "Preferences" item
in that menu. Click "Preferences".
