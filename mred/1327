Hi,

I took, in your web site, the version 101 of DrScheme, compiled for Linux 2.0
(ELF). After installation, some problems occured :

help-desk       --> segmentation-fault
drscheme        --> segmentation fault
drscheme-jer    --> ok
mzscheme        --> ok
mred            --> segmentation fault
setup-plt       --> ok
games           --> segmentation fault

Can you help me ?

Thank you.

 The problem is an incompatibility between glibc libraries.
 The solution is to download the DrScheme sources and 
 recompile MrEd and MzScheme.  You can download the Unix/X sources
 from http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/.
 The sources are near the bottom of the drop-down list.
