>Description:
I'm running DrScheme on a Mac Pro workstation (dual quad-core Xeons) running Mac OS X Leopard and I can't use it for more than a few minutes before it crashes.  The specific cause of the crash seems random, but I did notice on one crash report that the code was "translated from PPC code" which might be part of the problem.  I'm a Linux expert but a newbie at the Mac, so I'm not sure how to compile DrScheme from scratch, or if this is even wise.  One crash occurred as I was trying out the Fahrenheit->Celcius code from chapter 1 of HtDP (no kidding!).  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Launch DrScheme.
2. Write some functions.
3. It crashes at some random point.

Sorry I can't be more specific, but that's what happens.

 I'm not sure what is going on, but if you are getting a dialog about
 sending a bug report to apple, you can click "show details" and see a
 stack trace which might be helpful.
 
 Also, compiling on a mac is easy. Is the same configure, make, make
 install dance you would do under linux. (You need to install the "dev"
 stuff from the OS's install CDs.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:55 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
