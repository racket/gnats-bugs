>Description:
When using set-first-visible-item with a list box,
the list box does not show the items above the first
visible item (even if there is room) and draws the scroll
bar in such a way that it looks like there are not more
items.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 300))
(define c (make-object list-box% #f '("a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g") f void))
(send c set-first-visible-item 2)
(send f show #t)

 The problem is actually in resizing: when resizing the listbox changes
 the scrollbar's position, the list display needs to be updated for the
 new position.
 
 Fixed for the next release.
