>Description:
My students report that when they ask DrScheme v100
   to print (under Windows 98), DrScheme 
   always shows 32,000 pages as the number that needs
   to be printed.  One student uses an HP Deskjet 612c
   and the other uses a HP Deskjet 694c printer
   with the HP Deskjet 69x driver.
   
   (note: the auto generated info isn't valid,
          because I'm reporting a problem that
          appears on owlnet/home installations,
          not one on my machine)
>How-To-Repeat:
They claim this happens every time they print.

State-Changed-When: Fri Dec 10 07:55:19 1999
State-Changed-Why:
MrEd can't compute the number of pages until after a DC is created.
A DC can't be created until the user selects the printer.
Catch 22.

We could just remove the pages-to-print selection, but it
seems useful in case someone knows they only want one page, or
they have printined before and need a specific page.
