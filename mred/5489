>Description:
When an OS X keymapping like dvorak is chosen, the unmodified and
<command>- keys are remapped, but _not_ the <ctl>- keys.  All 
other applications observe the remapping for <ctl>- keys as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the OS X System Preferences App, choose the "International"
panel. Select the "Keyboard Menu" tab.  Click the "Dvorak" 
checkbox. Now switch to DrScheme, choose "DV" from the keyboard
menu in the menu bar (looks like a US Flag by default).

Notice that the <ctl>- keys are not remapped.

 What happens if you evaluate
 
  (special-control-key #f)
 
 ?
 
 [I had complete forgotten about this. I just happened to stumble across
 it while fixing the MrEd docs.]

 Setting special-control-key to #f does change the behavior of 
 DrScheme, but not in a way that I can readily characterize.  Here's 
 what I did:
 
 1) checked that the control keys were still unremapped in 202 with <ctrl>-k
 2) evaluated (special-control-key #f).
 3) tried <ctrl>-k for both the QWERTY and dvorak meanings of "k"; 
 neither one seemed to do anything at all (except that hitting them 
 ten or twenty times caused MrEd to collect garbage.

 This one has been re-reported two or three times, and affects me more 
 than anyone else in PLT, so I did a bit of homework.
 
 To summarize:  when using a nonstandard keymapping--dvorak, say--the 
 keys are not remapped when the control key is held down.  To reproduce:
 
 <to enable dvorak in OS X:>
 In the System Preferences menu, choose the "International" pane.  Then 
 choose the "Input Menu" tab.  check the "Dvorak" box.  Check the "show 
 input menu in menu bar" box at the bottom, if it's not already checked. 
   Quit. Now choose "Dvorak" from the drop-down menu in the menu bar (the 
 default one looks like an american flag).
 
 Now, start MrEd.  Hit the key labeled "s" on your keyboard.  This is 
 (correctly) remapped to "o".  Now hold down the control key, and hit 
 that same key.  Rather than "o", an "s" appears.
 
 
 
 It looks like the problem lies in the following piece of code, on line 
 717 of wxmac/src/mac/wx_app.cc
 
        if (transH && (cCurrentEvent.modifiers & wxMacDisableMods)) {
 	/* Remove effect of anything in wxMacDisableMods: */
 	int mods = cCurrentEvent.modifiers - (cCurrentEvent.modifiers & 
 wxMacDisableMods);
 	HLock(transH);
 	key = KeyTranslate(*transH, (key & 0x7F) | mods, &transState) & 
 charCodeMask;
 	HUnlock(transH);
        } else
 	key = cCurrentEvent.message & charCodeMask;
 
        if ((key > 127) && (key < 256)) {
 
 When tracing the code on a normal keypress, the program falls through 
 to the "else" clause, and key is assigned the ascii value 111.  
 However, when the control key is held down, the program is diverted 
 into the "then" clause, and the value of key--ascii 115--is received 
 from the result of the "KeyTranslate" call. It looks like this method 
 of acquiring a character input does not pass through the remapping 
 mechanism.  Can this code be discarded?

 Sorry - I should have let you know that I fixed this yesterday, though
 only for the v299 branch.
 
 If you'd like to copy the fix into the exp branch, it should be fairly
 easy.
