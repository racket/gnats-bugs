>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
Opening a large text file (in this case ~4M) makes DrScheme stop responding and spin the CPU.  (It seems like it's in some kind of GC thrash, but I don't have any way to be sure.)  

Here's an excerpt from top:

  PID COMMAND      %CPU   TIME   #TH #PRTS #MREGS RPRVT  RSHRD  RSIZE  VSIZE
  788 top          9.5%  0:01.17   1    14    17   236K   332K   532K  13.6M

  764 Terminal     0.7%  0:03.08   3    58   119  1.41M  6.96M  5.66M  50.1M 
  763 DrScheme    87.5%  5:31.13   2    71   266  77.9M  23.7M  90.8M   264M


In general, the IDE has trouble with large buffers, I have noticed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a moderately large text file---4M seems does it, but I haven't investigated what the smallest size that triggers this is.
>Fix:
Files open slowly, yes.  But they do open.  I opened a 4M file this morning (205.5).  It took a while. (I left for an hour, & when I came back, it was open.)
