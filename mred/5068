>Description:
I was in the midst of typing in a problem
report when DrScheme just hung on me.
All the windows are on my screen, but none
of them will refresh.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, no useful information.  I was in
the middle of the "Description" part of
the bug report.  I had pasted several bits
of text between the Help Desk and this window.
Specifically, I had copied the URLs for the
server configuration from the Web server docs.
