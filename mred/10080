>Description:
This student program used to work fine on a previous version of DrScheme.  Now, it crashes DrScheme (DrScheme doesn't actually report any kind of error, it just exits).  This is on Windows XP, and the program is being run in Advanced Student mode with the testing and world teachpacks.

I have tried various numbers for SIZE.  It works for SIZE 27, but breaks on SIZE 28.  Thinking that maybe the scene+line function wasn't handling non-integer values gracefully, I tried "round"ing the various values.  This seemed to allow me to increase the value of SIZE somewhat, but it still broke for larger values of SIZE.
I have also tried experimenting with the memory limit, but this had no effect.

 Hi Mark -- sorry for the delayed reply.
 
 I'm able to run the program below at level 150 on a (fast) mac after
 making a small change, namely using this definition of square:
 
 (define (square p1 p2 p3 p4 scene color)
   (scene+line scene
               (point-x p1) (point-y p1)
               (point-x p2) (point-y p2)
               color))
 
 since the squares are all less than a single pixel anyways, there's no
 point in drawing that pixel 4 times. Of course, that only lets you get
 a factor of 4 bigger.
 
 Still, I expect that the problem here is something windows-specific in
 the way the graphics library interacts with the OS. I'm not seeing
 lots of bitmaps being created, so maybe there is some other
 inefficiency in there.
 
 Matthew?
 
 Robby
