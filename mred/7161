The example program at

does not run.

reference to undefined identifier: mred:test:new-window.
Maybe the documentation is wrong.  Maybe it's missing some important preamble.  Maybe there's something wrong with the runtime.  A programmer attempting to learn how to use MrEd is given no clues as to what is wrong or how to fix it.

 No wonder -- that documentation is more than 6 years old!  PLT Scheme
 had three major revisions since then, each one had some substantial
 changes.  You can use DrScheme's Help Desk to get the manual version
 that fits your installed version.  BTW, you have version 206p1 which
 is also quite old -- v209 was released a short while ago.  You can get
 it at http://drscheme.org/
 
 (I've sent them a request to remove the outdated information.)
