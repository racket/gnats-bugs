I've got a Danish keyboard attached. When the keyboard language is set to Danish, keyboard shortcuts in DrScheme cause a ? to be printed in the editor instead of executing the command from the menu. Exceptions are command-Q and command-; that still work. I've tried it with other Unicode languages and some of them work, while others don't. Languages with Latin encoding seem to work in general.
>How-To-Repeat:
Activate the keyboard/language menu in the international system preferences and set the keyboard/language to Danish in the activated Finder menu. Open DrScheme and type something. Press command-S. 

Result: A ? occurs instead of being prompted to save the document.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 19 Sep 2006 22:42:08 -0400
Reason>>> This is fixed in SVN.

Thanks,
Matthew
