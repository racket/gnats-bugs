;; 1. evaluate code below

;; 3. drag mouse over editor canvas
;; 4. see mouse change to bar cursor
;; that would seem to indicate that the movement events
;; are going to the editor canvas even tho the panel
;; should have grabbed the mouse.

 Quick update on this problem:
 
 The grab is working ok. The problem is that X's cursor handling on
 grabs isn't what I thought, and the difference only shows up when a
 window has child windows.
 
 I'm working on a fix for 199.21.
