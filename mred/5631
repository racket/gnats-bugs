>Description:
apologies if this is a duplicate, but it's
been a while since I submitted these things
and I ran across it in a new context now.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. run code below 
;; 2. click in editor canvas to give focus 
;; 3. click on canvas% 
;; expect blinking caret in editor, but it isn't. 

(define c% 
  (class canvas% 
    (define/override (on-event evt) 
      (when (send evt button-down?) 
        (send ec focus))) 
    (super-instantiate ()))) 
 
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #F 400 400)) 
(define t (make-object text%)) 
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t)) 
(define c (make-object c% f)) 
(send f show #t)
