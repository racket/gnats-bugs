>Environment:
Mac PowerPC
>Description:
Please consider adding support for interactively adjustable split-pane positioning, such that the dividing location between the definition pane and the interactive pane can be interactively adjusted to accommodate the users desire to allocate some percentage of widow area to each view, and allow a present setting to be saved as a default setting; it would also be nice to provide a buttons such that the widow will show either and/or of these two views without having to use the menu per-se.

Additionally, support for interactively scrolled text (or what ever) via the scroll bars would be helpful, as would proportional scroll bars.

(I don't know if this is a limitation of the present Mac support, but supporting these features would greatly modernize the DrScheme Mac editor user interface environment. Please consider adding these features to your upcomeing 104 release.)
