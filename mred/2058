>Description:
It looks like up events and mouse grabbing have problems 
in the newly released mred. Sometimes no up events come,
sometimes no events during the grab come (sometimes both?).
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. evaluate code below
;; 2. click, drag and release
;;    see wrong output.

(define p%
  (class vertical-panel%
    (define down? #f)
    (rename [super-on-subwindow-event on-subwindow-event])
    (define/override (on-subwindow-event receiver evt)
      (cond
        [(send evt button-down? 'left)
         (set! down? #t)
         (printf "turning on~n")]
        [(and down? (send evt button-up?))
         (set! down? #f)
         (printf "turning off~n")]
        [(and down? (send evt moving?))
         (printf "moving~n")]
        [else (super-on-subwindow-event receiver evt)]))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 300 400))
(define p (make-object p% f))
(send f show #t)

 New Window.cc committed and exp-tagged. (I'd left a 0 where I meant to
 fill in the right flags...)
