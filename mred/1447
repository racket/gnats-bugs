>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
;; - run the program below.
;; - switch to another application
;;   (netscape and finder both seem to work)
;; - copy some text in that app
;; - switch back to mred
;; - the text field's contents do not change.

;; but, if you just switch windows in mred,
;; then the text that was copied in the finder
;; appears.

(define f%
  (class frame% args
    (override
      [on-activate
       (lambda (on?)
         (when on?
           (active)))])
    (sequence (apply super-init args))))

(define (active)
  (send (send tf get-editor) erase)
  (send (send tf get-editor) do-edit-operation 'paste))

(define f (make-object f% "frame" #f 100 100))
(define tf (make-object text-field% #f f void))
