>Description:
When executing the included source, memory consumption increases rapidly and continously, causing extreme levels of page-swapping, and rendering the computer temporarily unusable.
Clicking "stop" has no effect. Killing the program (through the scheme-menu) stops it, but does not free the memory. Closing the document/program does not free the memory. Completely quitting DrScheme does free the memory.

Granted, there are probably some bug in my code (I am not very experienced with scheme yet), but I'd thought there should be some form of protection against situations like this.

My Intel core duo MacBookcame to an immediate grinding halt when it had 512 MB Ram. Now, with two gigabytes, it takes some seconds before all the free memory is "converted" to "inactive" pages, just enough time to allow me to kill it.
  
Please let me know when the error has been foud, and / or fixed.

And thank you for giving us DrScheme. Its a nice tool.

 DrScheme doesn't release memory back to the OS. DrScheme3m, our
 experimental system with a different memory manager, does release
 memory back to the OS, and we hope to make that the standard version
 before too long.
 
 The unresponsive "Stop" button is not yet resolved. It's a Mac-specific
 problem where DrScheme doesn't register the mouse click on a button
 under heavy load.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:27 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
