>Description:
When starting DrScheme the application won't start. It fails with this message:
"Error: XfwfSetScrollbar called with incorrect arguments"

I'm running Gentoo with a 2.6.9 kernel, nptl, gcc 3.4.3, gnome 2.8.
If you need other information, feel free to ask.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Sat, 05 Feb 2005 12:24:51 -0500
Reason>>> mred


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:37:40 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
