I just load Dr Scheme.
I want to try it
But when I launch it (double click on DrScheme) then the "lambda" window appears
whit the bar and then the MrEd PPC shows the line :
************************************************************
require-relative-library-unit/sig: result from ("scm-unit.ss") is not a signed unit
************************************************************

I unstuffed the .sit
I launched Setup PLT
MrEd PPC can run alone
I tried the games

 This is an unusual error.  What version of DrScheme are you working with?
 
 If you haven't already resolved this error, send me a copy of the 
 file "scm-unit.ss" in the "zodiac" folder of the "collects" folder of 
 the DrScheme installation.
 
 Thanks,
