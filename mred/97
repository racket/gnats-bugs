	drscheme -x, Windows NT and FreeBSD
>Description:
	I have my autosave delay set to 10 seconds. When I open a file
in MrEd, edit it, and let it sit for a few seconds, I see an autosave
file. When I do the same thing in DrScheme (for a Scheme file), I
never see an autosave file. DrScheme *does* autosave non-Scheme files.
