MS Windows 95
>Description:
DrScheme causes fullscreen DOS boxes to crash and makes Win95 have
trouble shutting down.  It reports the actual crash in the video
driver (I have a Matrox Mystique 170 using driver release 370 (fairly
current, released ~1 month ago)).  This problem only occurs if DrScheme
has run on my system.

This doesn't seriously impede my use of DrScheme itself but it is very
annoying to have to shutdown my system, watch it crash, reboot, and
scandisk every time I want to use a dos box after using DrScheme.

If you need more details, I will be happy to provide.

As an aside, a bug report feature in DrScheme using its WWW access would
be pretty spiffy.

Thanks
>How-To-Repeat:
1.  start DrScheme
1a.  optionally exit DrScheme
2.  start a fullscreen DOS box
3.  watch the system error dialog appear:
"WinOldAp: An error has occurred..."

*or*

1.  start DrScheme
2.  exit DrScheme
3.  shut down Win95
4.  stare at the Black Screen of Death for several minutes
