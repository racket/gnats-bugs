>Description:
Following up my recent post to plt-scheme:  If an editor-snip% containing a text% is inserted, released, and re-inserted into a pasteboard%, after the second insert it is no longer possible to edit the contents of the text%; the caret doesn't appear when the snip is selected.

I first observed this with aligned-pasteboard%s, but it appears to occur with all pasteboard%s, actually.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following code creates a frame with a non-functioning editor-snip:

#lang scheme/gui
;; Ordinary pasteboard% test:
(define f2 (new frame% [label "pb test"][width 200] [height 200]))
(define pb2 (new pasteboard%))
(define ec2 (new editor-canvas% [parent f2] [editor pb2]))
(define ed (new text%))  ;; code box's editor
(define snip (new editor-snip%
                  [editor ed]
                  [with-border? #t]
                  [min-width 100]))
(send pb2 insert snip)
(send pb2 release-snip snip)
(send pb2 insert snip)
(send f2 show #t)

 Hi guys,
 
 Update:  The bug seems to be in pasteboard%'s release-snip.  See the  
 following code:
 
 #lang scheme/gui
 
 (define f1 (new frame% [label "text test"][width 200] [height 200]))
 (define txt (new text%))
 (define ec1 (new editor-canvas% [parent f1] [editor txt]))
 
 (define f2 (new frame% [label "pb test"][width 200] [height 200]))
 (define pb (new pasteboard%))
 (define ec2 (new editor-canvas% [parent f2] [editor pb]))
 
 (define ed (new text%))  ;; snip's editor
 (define snip (new editor-snip%
                    [editor ed]
                    [with-border? #t]
                    [min-width 100]))
 
 ;; The following lines that put snip into the text% after the pb%  
 create a
 ;; non-working snip in the text%.  If you swap 'pb' for 'txt', the  
 snip works
 ;; in the pb% after insertion/removal in the text%.
 (send pb insert snip)
 (send pb release-snip snip)
 (send txt insert snip)
 (send f1 show #t)
 (send f2 show #t)

 Hi again,
 
 A further update:  I found the bug.  In mred/private/wxme/ 
 pasteboard.ss lines 761ff. the arguments to add-flag and remove-flag  
 are given in reverse order.  remove-flag doesn't commute. :)
 
 Here is a diff showing the needed changes to pasteboard.ss:

 I'm sorry that I haven't had a chance to look into the problem.
 Thanks very much for tracking down the problem and supplying a patch!
 I've committed your change in SVN.
