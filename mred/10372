When there's a yes/no dialog, it should accept an Alt+Y/N as a way to click the corresponding button.  The same holds for several other similar dialogs, and probably a result of not using & in the labels.

 Do you have any examples?  Both for posterity, and so I can classify this bug.

 Seems that Alt+Y/N work, at least on linux and windows.  But there are
 two other minor problems still, both with a yes/no dialog:
 
 * On linux there are no underlines to indicate the possible keys.
 
 * When I hit enter in a yes/no dialog I get back 'no, which seems like
   a wrong default.
 
 Code to try:
 
   #lang racket/gui
   (message-box "Foo" "Foo?" #f '(yes-no))
