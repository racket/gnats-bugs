 When you write "crash" do you mean that the application disappears with
 a seg fault or a bus error or something like that? Or, do you mean that
 there is a Scheme error or that the program freezes and you have to
 force quit.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 The app disappears and is replaced with a small dialog box stating:
 
 "The application DrScheme has unexpectedly quit.
  The system and other applications have not been affected."
 
 Is this not repeatable for you? For me it also happens for me when I use
 the CVS source with John's precompiled binaries; so something changed in
 the last few days.
 
 Hope that info's helpful.

 We know of a crashing bug that is not reproducibile (except, on
 occasion on a single machine only) and you might be seeing that bug.
 Typically, however, that bug shows up at startup of the app, not when
 it runs. Also, re-building .zo files makes it go away, strangely
 enough. It appears to be a memory trashing bug.

 The problem here was that the tour moved to a new location and the link
 from DrScheme wasn't updated, probably because I didn't know about it!
 
 I've fixed it, and I'll check it in when I'm next online.
