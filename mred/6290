>Description:
The GUI Builder work seems to nicely tickle some wierd interaction
between the MrEd framework and the MAC/OSX graphics API, resulting
in what appears to be a reliable way to demonstraite the interaction.
(see below)
>How-To-Repeat:
- open DrScheme
- click in definition window
- select "insert GUI" menu item
- select "show GUI Toolbar"
(the whole screen washes out/in progressively for a second)
- select "hide GUI Toolbar"
(now the menu highlight is likely also reversed)
- repeat several "show/hide GUI Toolbar" a several times.
(the same behavior will often repeate itself)

wierd/interesting?
