>Description:
I have a dual-head setup, a PowerBook with an external
monitor.  Frames on the external monitor, which has
1600x1200 resolution, don't seem to get larger
than about 1024x768.  My gut tells me it's being
limited by the size of smaller 1024x768 screen, but
the window max height seems to be slightly higher than
768.
