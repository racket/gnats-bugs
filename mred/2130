MS Windows NT
>Description:
I can't change the language from English to anything else.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try changing the language from either the DrScheme startup dialog or the
menus.  Next time DrS starts, it's still in English.

BTW, maybe there's a better word than "Quit".  That's too close
to "Cancel" to my taste.  How about "Accept" or "Accept and Exit"?

 I suspect that this is a bug in write-resource and read-resource. Since
 I don't have this kind of machine readily available, can you verify
 that they work?

 I will change that.

 It looks like get-resource works, but write-resource does not.
 In a MrEd window, I called write-resource to store a value, but nothing
 showed up in the mred.ini file.  
 
 I tried putting 
 
   gui_language="French" 
 
 into the mred.ini file using an editor.  I can use get-resource to
 retrieve that value.  Indeed, DrScheme starts up in French with that
 change.
