>Description:
DrRacket can no longer produce distributable executables on Windows
7.  Essentially the same program that I distributed last week I cannot
get to run even on my own machine.

In Create Executable I choose the Distribution option to obtain a .zip
file (base Racket).  First of all, the file isn't even executable:

Roubaix ~/Desktop/r/gh/proj/wink/Try> ls -l wink/wink.exe
-rw-r--r--+ 1 sk None 7317760 2010-08-06 09:27 wink/wink.exe
Roubaix ~/Desktop/r/gh/proj/wink/Try> ./wink/wink.exe
bash: ./wink/wink.exe: Permission denied
Roubaix ~/Desktop/r/gh/proj/wink/Try> chmod a+x wink/wink.exe
Roubaix ~/Desktop/r/gh/proj/wink/Try> ./wink/wink.exe

At this point I get the error:

  Failure: cannot load DLL
  <this dir>\wink\lib\libracket3m_89or8o.dll

[filename copied by hand, so there may be mistakes]

The file seems to be there:

Roubaix ~/Desktop/r/gh/proj/wink/Try> ls -l wink/lib/libracket3m_89or8o.dll
-rw-r--r--+ 1 sk None 3084288 2010-08-03 11:20 wink/lib/libracket3m_89or8o.dll

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by ryanc at Wed, 08 Sep 2010 18:09:05 -0400
Reason>>> responsible (Please re-assign if appropriate.)



State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 24 Dec 2010 17:04:08 -0500
Reason>>> appears to have been fixed at some point in the past
