 Please check the date on the MrEd framework:
 
 [osterley:~] clements% ls -l 
 /Library/Frameworks/PLT_MrEd.framework/Versions/200/PLT_MrEd
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  2312120 Jun 25 11:48 
 /Library/Frameworks/PLT_MrEd.framework/Versions/200/PLT_MrEd
 
 
 If the date is earlier than this (say, Jun 24), you need to delete 
 this framework (that is, 'rm -rf 
 /Library/Frameworks/PLT_MrEd.framework') and reinstall.  The problem 
 here is that after fixing a small bug (just after the release) I 
 misunderstood the dynamics of the installer, and supposed that a new 
 bundle would replace existing frameworks, even if they had the same 
 version number.  Obviously, I was wrong.
 
 If my supposition is incorrect, please let me know as soon as 
 possible so I can track down this bug.
 
 Thanks,
 
 john clements
