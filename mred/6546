>Description:
The docs for get-position say:

(send a-text get-position start end) -> void 
   start : boxed exact non-negative integer or #f 
   end = #f : boxed exact non-negative integer or #f

The start box is filled with the starting position of the
selection, unless start is #f. The end box is filled with
the ending position of the selection, unless end is #f.



.... Ah!  the contract should read "#f or boxed exact non-negative integer"
to avoid confusion.


It's not obvious to me how to fix this in the docs.

 
>How-To-Repeat:
(send (instantiate text% ()) get-position (box #f) (box 3))

=>

get-position in text%, extracting boxed argument: expects 
argument of type <non-negative exact integer>; given #f

Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 05:11:00 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Sat, 03 Apr 2004 11:58:53 -0500
Reason>>> I'm not sure who knows how to fix this -- I've looked in
iplt/doc and it's not there.  Maybe this is something that
is extracted from a contract that should change?
Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Sat, 03 Apr 2004 12:05:23 -0500
Reason>>> mrf's

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:16 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
