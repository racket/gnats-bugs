>Description:
When a dialog with a parent is frontmost get-top-level-focus-window
returns #f.

Note to self: When this bug is fixed, remove the "#f" on line 609 in
              plt/collects/framework/finder.ss (in def'n of
              common-get-file)


>How-To-Repeat:
(thread
 (letrec ([f (lambda ()
	       (let ([w (get-top-level-focus-window)])
		 (display (and w (list (send w get-label)))))
	       (newline)
	       (sleep 1)
	       (f))])
   f))

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(send f show #t)
(define d (make-object dialog% "dialog" f))
(send d show #t)

;; bring dialog to front, #f's will be printed.
;; unlike when frame is front most and (frame) will
;; be printed

 I've fixed this in Xt and Windows for the next release, but I think
 that MacOS does not have this bug. Can you verify that MacOS is already
 right?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
