 I guess the error should instead be something about a bitmap-allocation
 failure.
 
 Robby: It would be nice if DrRacket's memory limit kicked in, but (I
 think) because the bitmap is being allocated in DrRacket's space to
 show in the interactions Window, the memory use is charged to DrRacket
 itself. Would it be possible/easy to force the creation of the bitmap
 in the user's space?

 The drracket printer now specially recognizes 2htdp/images and, on the
 user thread, forces them to do their bitmap creation/drawing, so that
 by the time they get to the drracket space, the drawing consists only
 of drawing the bitmap (and some selection stuff -- no serious
 allocation tho).
 
 I also considered having drracket use the convertible interface, but
 that seemed worse, since selecting a 2htdp/image image might not look
 right.
 
 But I'm not sure about that. The advantage is fewer special cases in
 the drracket printer.
 
 Robby
