>Description:
Trying to print on linux Redhat Eneterprise version
2.4.21-27.EL kernel doesn't work for multi-page files.
I get a single page of output, which is overprinted multiple
times in a way that is hard to read.
Printing via the previewer, gv, works fine.
But this causes considerable consternation for my
students... 
>How-To-Repeat:
0. Login to a linux machine.
1. Open DrScheme on the file PLT/collects/ssax/input-parse.scm.
2. Click on the File menu, select Print Definitions...
3. Select to print directly to the printer. Leave everything
else as the default (I tried
using a networked postscript printer (a HP 8150),
and used 8.5x11 page size, Horizontal and vertical scale
factor of 0.8, no horizontal or vertical translation,
using lpr as the printer.

Reason>>> mr

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 10 Feb 2005 17:37:22 -0500
Reason>>> The problem is that DrScheme generates a file with an EPS
header. Some printer drivers take this as a hint to ignore
all showpage commands, so mutliple pages sprial into
the first page.

This is fixed for the next version. Meanwhile, one workaround
is to delete the "EPSF-2.0" that shows up in the first line of
a DrScheme-generated PostScript file.

Thanks for the report,
Matthew
