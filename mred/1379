>Description:
Run the program below. The string "Untitled" shows up
right next to the box and the string "(define ...)" shows
up overlapping with the box.

Even if this is not fixable, please let me know if the
string _should_ be overlapping with the text or not.

Thanks!

 I'm not sure I understand the PR, but the issue seems to be how MrEd's
 text-size information relates to the actual pixels that make up a
 string image.
 
 In the example code, the text always appears within the rectangle,
 possibly overlapping with the rectangle's frame, regardless of platform
 or font size.
 
 Under Windows, for the case of "Untitled", none of the pixels of the
 text overlap with the rectangle pixels. In the case of "(define ...)",
 the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the text overlap with the
 rectangle.
 
 Under X, in contrast, rightmost text pixels overlap with the rectangle
 in both cases, and leftmost text pixels do not overlap with the
 rectangle in either case.
 
 As the font is scaled, text pixels sometimes overlap and sometimes
 don't overlap, depending on the font size. Both Windows and X produce
 varying results for varying font sizes.
 
 So the conclusion is this: MrEd (or the OS it runs on) reports a width
 that is guranteed to contain the text string. However, some undefined
 number of pixels to the left and right (and top and bottom) of the
 displayed string may be whitespace, depending on the whims of the font
 designer and the font scaling mechanism. [I'll add that to the
 documentation.]
 
 Have I understood the PR?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
