>Description:
Hi,

Maybe it's just me but, using the latest release of DrScheme, when I select text from a Word 2007 document, copy it, then try to paste it into either the Definitions or Interactions window, it is pasted as an image, not as text.

I tried pasting the text into TextEdit then copying it from there into DrScheme and the text pasted correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Create text in Word 2007 (Mac)
2) Highlight the text
3) Copy the text
4) Paste the text (from clipboard) into Definitions/Interactions windows.

It is pasted as an image?
