>Description:
In drscheme, after an io box is inserted into the repl, the
prompt is not drawn. There is a little space to the
left of the caret, but the prompt is invisible. Forcing the 
buffer to redraw the line makes the prompt re-appear.

 Also, when the drs window is covered (by a window in another app, maybe
 also with another drs window, I dunno) and uncovered, the prompt disappears 
 again. It might just be the last line that isn't redrawing.

This was fixed before the 52 release. It was also fixed just before
the 51 release, but the change somehow got lost.
