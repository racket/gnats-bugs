>Description:
I can not edit files using the editor that comes when drscheme is typed
on the commandline. More precisely, I can paste text, but can not type any text.
The same is true with the open url option of the file menu. The
dialog box pops but text can not be typed into the box. I tried the
serach option of the edit menu. As before, I couldn't enter any text
in the serach field.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ drscheme
; the default window pops up.
; type text
; select open url option of file menu and type text
