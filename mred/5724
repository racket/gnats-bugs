>Description:
Well, I'm not sure if this is a bug at all, however "Create Executable..." on OS X behaves very unexpectly (for me): It brings up a dialog box to choose a destination folder. Instead of creating a new application bundle in this destination folder it removes all contents of the folder and puts the bundle-files there -- without asking before! So, if I choose the "Desktop folder" or my home directory for example, evertyhing in there will be deleted without a warning. IMHO this is a bit dangerous, it's probably not the way Mac-users expect "Create Executable..." to work. Maybe it would be nice (safer?), if "Create Executable..." simply creates a new folder inside the destination folder, named after the scheme-file (+ ".app").

 Will we be doing anything beyond documentation for this for 202?

 I would hope so. An interface that deletes a whole directory without
 warning is not what we want.

 I infer from this that the problem is somehow mine? I suppose if I could tell 
 which directories were .app files I could open a warning dialog if the user 
 selected one that wasn't? Except if they just created the directory? Or, 
 perhaps you are thinking that I should build a put-directory dialog?

 I think the current interface should report an error when the given
 file/directory doesn't have the expected suffix. And when executables
 are directories, DrScheme should provide a warning that the selected
 directory will be replaced.
 
 If I find a spare half day, I'll try again to customize the put-file
 dialog. I notice that PackageMaker makes it work for package targets,
 so it must be possible. Also, I think I've stumbled across the key
 toolbox function, but the docs have too few details to know how it
 actually works. I'll have to experiment, which will take a half day if
 I guess well, up to a day otherwise.
 
 It's not likely that I'll find a half day before we want to send v202
 out, though.
 
 Matthew

 I've done this (soon to be checked in).
 
 I'll move the PR to your ownership for the other bits.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 25 Nov 2005 07:47:40 -0500
Reason>>> In 299.403 and later, DrScheme's "Create Executable" interface
finally views executables as bundles instead of directories.
