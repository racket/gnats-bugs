>Description:
Type the following, execute and look at the new window: none of 
the items in the list box are visible. Resize the window and the
items appear. (I had 100's of item in there at first; same effect)

(define F (make-object frame% "List" #f))

(define P (make-object horizontal-panel% F))

(define L (make-object list-box% "Stress Testing List Boxes" the-list P void))

(send F show #t)
