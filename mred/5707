>Description:
Right clicking on the <> icon in an XML box brings up a menu
that flashes wildly as long as the right button is held down.
This is contrasted with the behavior of the Edit menu you get
when right clicking in other parts of DrScheme where the menu is rock solid.

Reason>>> The XML box snip (actually, decorated-editor-snip%) popped
up the menu for any event when the right button is held down,
as opposed to a right-button-click event. This doesn't matter
under Mac OS X, where a pop-up menu blocks all of MrEd. But
it matters under X.

I fixed decorated-editor-snip%.
