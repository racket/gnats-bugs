>Description:
If I run traces from MrEd then the File -> Toggle bottom stuff menu item has the keyboard shortcut cmd-shift-t, but it doesn't work. When I try to use it, the File menu flashes but the bottom stuff does not toggle.

(In DrScheme, the menu item doesn't have a keyboard shortcut.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Run (traces ...) from MrEd and press cmd-shift-t. Observe that the File menu flashes but the bottom stuff does not toggle.

With the mouse, click the menu item to toggle the bottom stuff and try the keyboard shortcut again. Same result.

 Strangely enough, I don't see a shortcut in the code nor do I see one
 in the menus. This one's mysterious to me!

 Oops! I set that keyboard shortcut manually in the Keyboard & Mouse prefere=
 nces.
 
 In that case, my bug is that menu items triggered in this way in
 DrScheme and MrEd appear to have no effect other than flashing their
 menu title. Since I use custom shortcuts successfully with various
 other applications, I expect this is a bug with DrScheme/MrEd instead
 of OSX.
 
 Steps to reproduce:
 1. Add a custom keyboard shortcut:
   a. System Preferences -> Keyboard & Mouse -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> +
   b. For Application, you'll probably have to use Other... and
 navigate to DrScheme.app/MrEd.app
   c. For Menu Title, use anything found in DrScheme or MrEd, e.g.
 "Show Module Browser" in DrScheme
   d. Set a shortcut, e.g. cmd-shift-m
 2. (Re)start DrScheme/MrEd and verify that the shortcut displays next
 to the menu item
 3. Press the keyboard shortcut, and observe that the menu title
 flashes but nothing else happens

 Yes. Unfortunately, this is not easy to fix, and it will most likely
 have to wait for the planned re-write of MrEd (which will resume as
 soon as I have time).
