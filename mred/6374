>Description:
DrScheme's s-expression highlighting gets disabled when you
insert a comment box and then "uncomment" the box by selecting
Scheme -> Uncomment from the menu.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a new DrScheme window.
2. Special -> Insert Comment Box
3. With cursor inside the box, Scheme -> Uncomment
4. Type (). Notice that the expression is not highlighted in
gray when the cursor is next to it.

 Matthew, the code below seems to demonstrate a bug in mred, or in my
 understanding of it. Here are the printouts that I see:
 
   it on-focus: #f
   ot on-focus: #f
   ot on-focus: #t
   it on-focus: #t
   ot on-focus: #f
 
 and then when I click on the button, I see this:
 
   it on-focus: #f
 
 but the focus seems to be in the outer editor. When I type, characters
 show up there.
 
 Out of curiosity, is this covered in a test suite? I guess it's not an
 automatic one, but I wonder, do you think it could be made automatic? I
 would think that it could be, by turning the button click below into
 a queue'd callback.

 (define t%
   (class text%
     (init-field l)
     (define/override (on-focus x)
       (printf "~a on-focus: ~s\n" l x))
     (super-new)))
 
 (define it (new t% (l "it")))
 (define es (new editor-snip% (editor it)))
 (define ot (new t% (l "ot")))
 
 (send ot insert es)
 
 (define f (new frame% (label "") (width 100) (height 100)))
 (define ec (new editor-canvas% (parent f) (editor ot)))
 (define b
   (new button% 
        (label "button")
        (parent f)
        (callback
         (lambda (x y)
           (send ot delete 0 1)))))
 
 (send f show #t)

 Yes, it looks like a bug. I'll try to look into it.
