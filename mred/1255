 Matthew, do you plan to respond to this person? (I fixed the scheme bug,
 but not the other one. I don't have linux to test 100. see if the bug is
 still present.

 I'm not able to reproduce the crash with either version 100 or 101. It
 might have been some sort of library incompatibility.

 So, this should fall under the general "recompile if not version X, Y,
 or Z of linux" umbrella? Is that blurb written? If so, I can respond
 to him.

 Is it possible to test for the version of RedHat they are using? If
 you can find some tag file somewhere in your version (I think that the
 stuff ahead of the login: prompt is in some file somewhere in /etc) I
 will put the contents of it into the Help Desk bug reports. This will
 save lots of email when people have the library problem in general.

        ivar: instance variable not found: checked? in class: control-event%
        Segmentation fault 
 
 Re the seg fault:
 
 There are variations in the libraries used in Linux distributions.
 We've found that the binaries we distribute, which we build on RedHat, 
 are not always compatible with other Linux distributions, or even
 RedHat, if the libraries have been updated.  
 
 Try recompiling MrEd from sources, and see if that makes a difference.
 
 We're about to release v.101, which we've built on RH6.1, so you may want 
 wait for it.

>Unformatted:
 
 I have fixed the problem in the Scheme code, but not the segmentation
 fault. I have not exp tagged the fix (but my next framework release will
 exp tag it) becuase it might be required to reproduce the crashing bug.
