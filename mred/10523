>Description:
In a fresh buffer, hit "1", then type spaces until you reach the end of the
screen -- the next space will make the whole thing reflow in some strange way
to the middle of the next line ("strange" might be an attempt to put the soft
newline in the middle of the block of spaces).  Now type "2" (shown on the next
line).  Deleting spaces on this second line should reflow the "2" back up, but
it doesn't -- but typing a new space does.
