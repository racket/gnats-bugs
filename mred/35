DrScheme 47 on Windows 95 Hebrew edition
>Description:
Also: At home, I'm running Windows 95 Hebrew edition. The first few
lines of the listener are blurry (literally!), and this doesn't happen
on the ordinary U.S. edition ... I have no idea why this happens,
because you shouldn't be using anything from the national
customisation parts, but perhaps there's a bug in Windows itself. The
change of fonts, incidently, has to do with (1) A larger point size;
(2) Selecting a Hebrew font, so that ascii 224 and up are redefined to
be Hebrew.

This was mentioned in a personal message to Matthew and me by Mayer
Goldberg (tantris@actcom.co.il).  Feel free to write him if you need
more information on this.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem is that MrEd selects an essentially random font
for the starting text under Windows. It's not really random -
Windows picks the first "decorative" font, where "first" is
hard to pin down.

Probably there is a good default "decorative" font to use on
all Windows machines. This better default should be hard-wired into
MrEd. Eventually, MrEd will have a dialog that lets users pick
a specific font themselves.
