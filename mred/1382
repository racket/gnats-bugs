>Description:
Evaluate the code below and
type control-h or control-i or control-m, which will
and modify the buffer. This should not happen.
(perhaps there are others?)

type control-t and see the printout.
That should happen...
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 200 200))
(define t (make-object text%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send ec focus)
(define mb (make-object menu-bar% f))
(define m (make-object menu% "Menu" mb))
(make-object menu-item% "Item h" m (lambda x (printf "callback h~n")) #\h)
(make-object menu-item% "Item i" m (lambda x (printf "callback i~n")) #\i)
(make-object menu-item% "Item m" m (lambda x (printf "callback m~n")) #\m)
(make-object menu-item% "Item t" m (lambda x (printf "callback t~n")) #\t)
(send f show #t)
