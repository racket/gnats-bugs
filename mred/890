>Description:
When a canvas gets a click while shift is down and the user lets go of
the shift key, but keeps the button down, the subsequent moving events
still have the shift key modifier flag set.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define canvas
  (make-object (class canvas% ()
		 (override
		   [on-event
		    (lambda (evt)
		      (printf "shift-down? ~s~n"
			      (send evt get-shift-down)))])
		 (sequence
		   (super-init frame)))))
(send canvas min-width 100)
(send canvas min-height 100)
(send frame show #t)

;; click in the canvas with shift down
;; let go of the shift key
;; move the mouse around
;; the printfs should change to #f, but they dont
