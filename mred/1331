 I much prefer the behavior of not sending enter and leave events to a
 window that has grabbed the mouse (as currently implemented for MacOS
 and Windows), but I'm not sure how hard it will be to make MrEd/X match
 that convention. Making MacOS and Windows match X's behavior would be
 similarly painful.
 
 I will probably leave things as they are for now. At least you always
 get _some_ event on the transition from the cursor being in/grabbed-by
 a window to out-of/ungrabbed-by the window, or vice-versa (i.e., any
 transition where the cursor's shape would change).
 
 Meanwhile, I'll try to think of a fix for X.

 Okay, now I am confused. I'm not sure I understand what you are
 saying, but if I do, that means I cannot implement button-like
 behavior with a canvas%, which seems wrong. If I am wrong, can you
 explain how I would do that?

 You can always use the x and y coordinates in a mouse event to
 determine whether the cursor is still in the canvas's region.
