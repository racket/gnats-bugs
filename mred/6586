I can't save anything: I try Ctrl-S, File|Save, File|Save As..., and no matter what, it crashes. I uninstalled, rebooted, and reinstalled the latest nightly binary, and still I can't save anything. Ouch.

 Robby,
 
 Thanks for the quick response -- I was in mid-follow-up email when you 
 sent it. Here's an update: it only appears to happen when I open a 
 particular Scheme file at one particular directory location, then open a 
 new file and try and save it. It doesn't happen from any other file, 
 even from the same file if I move it to a different directory location. 
 I tried looking up the file name in the Windows registry and didn't come 
 up with anything.
 
 Here are the exact steps (tomorrow Eli can come by my desk and I will 
 reproduce it for him):
 
 1. Double click C:\Documents and 
 Settings\dherman\Desktop\pe-flow\format-test.scm
 2. File | New
 3. File | Save Definitions
 
 The particular crash is a Windows dialog saying "DrScheme.exe has 
 generated errors and will be closed by Windows. You will need to restart 
 the program. An error log is being created."
 
 Sorry I panicked and sent this as a critical -- it looks to be less of a 
 big deal now since it only happens from this one location. I'll be less 
 trigger-happy in the future. :}
 
 Thanks,
 Dave

 Ah, don't worry! Thanks for the detective work. Matthew may be in
 contact for more details if necessary (lucky me: that sound like his
 code ;).
