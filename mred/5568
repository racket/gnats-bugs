>Description:
DrScheme and Sirmail don&apos;t start up when running mred on a solaris machine
with the display on a linux machine.  This may only be a problem with some
configurations. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. ssh from a debian linux machine in the cs lab at brown to
    subra.ccs.neu.edu at northeastern.
2. try to start sirmail or drscheme
3. notice that mred starts okay by itself.

subra:ptg$ sirmail
compound-unit/sig: keymap&apos;s 4th linkage (which is handler) contains an extra value name `size-recently-opened-files&apos; that is not required by keymap unit&apos;s 4th import (which is handler)
subra:ptg$ mred
subra:ptg$ drscheme
compound-unit/sig: keymap&apos;s 4th linkage (which is handler) contains an extra value name `size-recently-opened-files&apos; that is not required by keymap unit&apos;s 4th import (which is handler)
You have mail in /var/mail//ptg

 have you tried re-building .zo files?

    never mind.  Checking everything out again and rebuilding .zos
    eliminated the problem.
