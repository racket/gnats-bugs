>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
;; run the program below
;; see twenty-ish extra blank pixels to the right of the list box. 
;; I think that they shouldn't be there.

;; in fact, they go away if the frame is resized.

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define hp (make-object horizontal-panel% f))
(make-object list-box% #f null hp void '(single))
(send f show #t)
