>Description:
When drawing rotated text, it's often not at all convenient to rotate the text around its top-left corner, which is the default behavior. I've attached code that draws text rotated around one of eight anchor points identified by a symbol.

It could easily be extended to anchor to three points on the baseline, or to arbitrary points given in dc coordinates relative to the top-left corner.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (draw-text/anchor dc str x y
                          [anchor 'tl] [combine? #f] [offset 0] [angle 0])
  (define-values (width height _1 _2)
    (send dc get-text-extent str #f #t))
  (define dx
    (case anchor
      [(tl l bl top-left left bottom-left)     0]

 If you were to pick a canonical symbol for those directions
 (preferably by finding some precedent in racket/gui) and also allow
 offset to be a pair of numbers (perhaps upper-left relative), then I
 think the below would make a find addition as a method of a dc<%>
 object. That stuff is all in Racket now, so you could even add it
 yourself, I guess.

 I didn't think of these before, but the prefixes to the *-superimpose 
 functions from slideshow might be good symbols for anchor points: 'lt 
 (left-top), 'ct (center-top), 'rt, 'lc, etc.
 
 The baseline ones - 'lbl, 'cbl, 'rbl - would also be handy. (Though I 
 don't know what 'ltl is supposed to mean. Left top line?)
 
 Another option is to separate the anchor argument into two arguments 
 anchor-x and anchor-y. A flonum would mean a relative x or y position on 
 the text string, and a symbol would mean a special position. We'd need 
 fewer special symbols that way, and picking canonical ones would be 
 easy: 'left, 'center, 'right, 'top, 'bottom, 'baseline.

 Yes, left-top-line. There are two horizontal "points of insterest" in
 a pict. The baseline of the top line of text and the baseline of the
 bottom line of text (they are the same place when there  is only a
 single line of text, but you can use both of them if you start
 vl-append'ing, etc.).

 Either way sounds good to me. I'm not thinking of any other methods
 that take similar symbols, but maybe Matthew can.
 
 He can probably also suggest a place to put tests.
