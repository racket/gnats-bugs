MS Windows 95
>Description:
Whenever I run Dr. Scheme in Windows 95, it inadvertently crashes when
I close Windows, returning a fatal exception.  I cannot press CTRL+ALT+DEL,
and pressing any key to continue does not work either.  I have to shut my
machine off.  No permanent damage results, but the problem is a major
annoyance to have to deal with, especially as a COMP 210 student, where
Dr. Scheme is an integral part of the course.  Several times, I have had to
run Scandisk to make sure nothing is wrong as Windows did not close
properly the last time I ran it.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run Dr. Scheme
2. Close Dr. Scheme
3. Shut down the computer
(the crash will occur here)

Are you printing from within DrScheme? We have received reports of
problems printing from DrScheme in WIndows 95 with certain printer
drivers.

 We've now received one other problem report about DrScheme and Windows
 95 crashing. If you could answer a couple of questions, it might help
 us track down the problem.
 
  1) The other user sees a system error dialog when he is running
     DrScheme and he starts a "fullscreen DOS box". Does this happen for
     you?
 
  2) Since his problem seems to be associated with the display,
     he reports that his video driver is "Matrox Mystique 170".
     Although it's unclear whether this is relevant, can you tell
     us about your display driver?
 
  3) Can you tell us more about your hardware? How much RAM, etc.?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew


REPLY:

 Sure.
 As to 1), I haven't had anything like that.. Just at the end, when I 
 close windows, the blue screen of death appears.
 But not always...

 I have a Compaq Presario 4508, 32 MB RAM, 
 video card and drivers: I have a Compaq Presario 1425 monitor and the 
 drivers for that, but no special video adapters.

 If you need to know more specs on the hardware, contact me again.

No idea what happened, and we didn't get any other reports except PR
317. Let's release 51 and see if we get more reports.
