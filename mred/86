>Description:
The file menu (presumably MrEd's) does not notice when the current
directory has changed.  Hence, it gives an out-of-date file list.  In
addition, the only way of updating the list is not obvious (clicking
on the directory selector at the top); there is no "Update" button.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go into DrScheme, try to Open a file.  Then go to a shell and change
some filenames.  Go back into Open.
>Fix:
One possibility (under Unix, at least) is to check the last update
time for the directory and re-read it if that has changed.
