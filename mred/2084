>Description:
DrScheme doesn't report any error when trying to use a bogus
program name as the printer previewer.

Note also that if you don't give any Preview Command program
name at all (i.e. erase the default of "gv"), you get an error
message saying:
find-executable-path: expects argument of type <path string>; given ""
which is not very explicit...

>How-To-Repeat:
Open the Print Definitions menu, select Preview as the destination,
and give a bogus program name in the Preview Command field.
Click Ok. Nothing happens.
