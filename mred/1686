>Description:
when a graphics window is created, drscheme version 103 goes nuts.
I mean really, really bonkers. The recycle sign starts blinking
on and off, even though the computation has finished, the
repl shows a prompt, and the "break" button results in only
the words "user break" showing on the screen.

The memory command "top" shows that mred jumps to using about 97% 
of my system's CPU and 34% of my memory. I don't know what
is going on. 

The only reason I discovered this is because a student reported
some wierd problems to me. I think he's using a PC and I'm
using the Linux version, so it is not just an operating system
issue.

I also still have had severe problems compiling version103.
I think I'm forced to downgrade to version 102.

 actually, I'll have to downgrade to version 101.
 
 FYI: version 103 failed (fatally) during compilation on 3 unix
 machines (debian, solaris, redhat). Version 102 failed on redhat and I
 didn't bother trying on the others. Version 101 compiled without
 problems on redhat and solaris, and failed on the debian machine
 because it seems to be missing some X11 include files (not your
 problem, I know.) I guess I hadn't upgraded from 101 before now, so
 didn't notice the 102 problems.

 I can't reproduce the problem.
 
 With 103 under Solaris, I tried
 
      (require-library "graphics.ss" "graphics")
      (open-graphics)
      (open-viewport "problem" 400 400)
 
 and got a prompt back immediately.  Try running
 
     setup-plt -c 
 
 at the shell prompt and see if the problem continues.

 For the 103 version, did you run 
 
     configure
 
 before doing the make?

 since I don't have v103 installed right now, i'll defer this until
 December when I start making preparations for my spring semester's
 class. For this semester, I encouraged the several people who had
 problems to downgrade to version 101, and their problems went away.

 p.s. Yes, I ran configure before making.

 OK, now that it's December, have you had a chance to 
 look at this again?
 
 We don't run Debian here, so we can't reproduce the 
 problem directly.
