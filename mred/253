>Description:
*Except for the console*, every time I press a key, the
cursor quickly flashes from the insertion bar to a watch.
(If I hit multiple keys quickly, the cursor only flashes
once.)

I can't see this under Windows, but I think Windows is just
too fast. I do see the problem with both Xt and Motif.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open MrEd
Select Frame|New
Type into the buffer with your eyes open, 
  looking at the cursor
Wait 0.1 to 2.0 seconds
See flash
 (if you don't see it, try agin)

This is exactly the right behavior, since I have my autosave delay set
to 2. The watch cursor is an indication that my file is being saved.
