 Quoting Paul Steckler:

 MzScheme doesn't draw its own output, so this PR doesn't really make
 sense.
 
 I see that the Windows shell does indeed print garbage, at least as I
 have it configured. XEmacs prints the right thing, though.
 
 Probably anyone who speaks French will have an appropriately configured
 shell. Otherwise, you'll have to forward the PR to Microsoft. :)

 Actually, I was using Cygwin at the time.  Maybe the codepage is
 configurable there via termcap.
 
 I'll close the PR.
