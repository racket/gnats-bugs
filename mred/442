>Description:
after some twiddling with the source code, I was able to get mred/mzscheme to complie on mklinux.  H
However, after the make no binaries are present anywhere.  I like Drscheme, and would like to be
able to use it under MkLinux.  I am using gnu make version 3.75 on the latest MKlinux release.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. screw with source code
2. xmkmf
3. make

 I don't know anything about MkLinux, but I know the first challenge
 will be getting the GC to work. This is not hopeless, but it may be
 challenging (or it may work easily). Have you looked at the GC?  If
 so, can you compile and link just MzScheme (not MrEd)?
 
 If there are a lot of changes to make and you're interested in working
 out the port with me, perhaps it's best of we start with a version 51
 beta of MzScheme.
