>Description:
There seem to be duplicate strings added to the kill 
ring in various situations. Below are two particular
ones, there may be others.

This bug makes makes editing quite frustrating for me.
I rely heavily on the kill ring -- I am
often interested in keeping 2 or 3 things
in the last 10 or so "alive" to bring back later.
with this bug I start losing some of them.
(I say `last 10' because this is X and any 
 selection becomes a copy, so I often get 
 extra stuff in there)

I thought I had been going crazy recently!

>How-To-Repeat:
1. new drscheme window
2. type 1111
3. type c-a; c-k
4. type abcd
5. type alt-shift-right
6. type control-y (no change, except selection removed, good so far)
7. type esc-y (no change again, bad -- should have become 1111)
8. type esc-y (now see the 1111)

this also happens if step 5 is replaced 
with shift-control-left (backward select word)
and shift-up (select line up),or 
with mouse-based-selection.

Here's a worse one:

1. type `111'
2. c-a, then c-k.
3. type `2222\n3333\n4444\n5555\n6666\n'
   (actually type \n as a return character not
    as a \ followed by an n.)
4. shift-up, shift-up, shift-up, shift-up, shift-up
   (everything should be selected now)
5. control-y
6. esc-y many times and you don't get 1111, 
   you get lots of junk. I got four times
   the `2222\n3333\n4444\n5555\n6666\n'
   string, one time the 6666 string and
   then finally the 1111 string, for a total
   of five extra things in the kill ring.

 oops, got my left and right backwards. That should be alt-shift-left.
