>Description:
Hello, this one is kinda tricky. I have PLT-Scheme working on Linux (as usual), but I have set up composite and enabled it. By enabling it I enable also fading menus. Now, however, enabled menus will show up as blank. Nothing shows up, only when hovering with the mouse on the menus, the letters show up.
You can see that:

By the way, I'm using 370.1 from svn but this was already present in previous versions.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is exactly how my system is configured:
1. Enlightenment DR16
2. X enabled composite
3. E16 composite settings with enabled composite and enabled fading
4. start drscheme
5. click on a menu

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:53 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
