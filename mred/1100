>Description:
When a long line (auto-wrapped in drscheme) is broken by inserting a
newline in a strange place, the wrong one of the two new lines is
re-tabbed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new window. Type the following:

   a   a  aaaaaaaaaaaa....

In other words, three spaces followed by 'a' followed by three spaces 
followed by 'a' followed by three spaces followed by a _whole_lot_ of
'a's (enough so that the line auto-wraps.

So far, everything is okay.  Now, the line will be auto-wrapped after the
second 'a'.  Note that if you move around using the arrow keys, the cursor 
can never be to the right of the second 'a' on the first line.  In
particular, the cursor will jump to the beginning of the 'second' line
rather than moving into the spaces between the second 'a' and the long
string of 'a's.  

Now, click the mouse to the right of the second 'a', near the edge of the
screen.  The cursor now appears in a funny place; that is, to the right
of the unreachable spaces.

Now, hit return.  This separates the long line into two shorter lines.
The _first_ line is re-tabbed (i.e., the leading spaces disappear), but
the new second line is _not_ retabbed; it should move to the right, but
doesn't.

Finally, note that if you position the cursor at the end of the second 'a'
using the arrow keys, and then hit return, everything works as it should.
It's only when using the mouse that this effect occurs.

Fix: don't permit the user to place the cursor after those 'unreachable'
spaces.

 Short version: It's a MrEd bug that's now fixed.

 I think you meant three spaces, 'a', three spaces, 'a', ONE space,
 'aaa...', right? (Otherwise, you can easily move the caret to the RHS
 of the second `a' with the left-arrow key.)
 
 Trivia: Even with one space, you can get to the RHS of the last space
 in the first line using only the keyboard. Move the caret deep into the
 second line, then press the up-arrow key.

 The same thing happens in you move the caret to the start of the second
 line (which is the same text position as the end of the first line). So
 the proposed fix doesn't solve the problem. 
 
 The problem is actually a bug in text%'s `insert', which I've now
 fixed.
 
 BTW, if you click to the right of an auto-wrapped line, I don't think
 the caret should jump to the left of the next line. The text% class
 specially handles positions that have two locations (one at the end of
 a line, the other at the start) and provides a method for determining
 whether the caret is at the end-of-line or start-of-line for such
 positions.
 
 Thanks for the detailed bug report.
