>Description:
I know, it's aesthetic, but it would be nice if fonts
looked better in Mac OS X. The default Courier is pretty
nasty, and Monaco, which is a pretty popular monospaced
font for the Mac, doesn't look right. Is it maybe not using
the OS's smoothing? I don't know a whole lot about fonts.

Sorry if this is trifling, but good fonts do make a
difference in code readability, and Macs have the ability
to make fonts look gorgeous.

(While I'm being petty, it would also be nice if the
different fonts used in the interactions window were
configurable.)

 Warning!  Personal preference alert: I use Monaco 10 under OS X and I'm 
 pretty happy with it.  There's no smoothing involved that I can see.
 
 As a side note, OS X does nice smoothing, but only (I believe) for apps 
 that jump from the "Carbon/Classic" style of drawing text to some newer 
 mechanism.  Though I could be wrong about this, I believe that DrScheme 
 still uses the Classic mode of text-drawing, and will therefore not 
 show new-style smoothing.
 
 On the other hand, when I look at really large fonts, there's clearly 
 some antialiasing going on; there are no sharp jaggies on the diagonals.
 So... what do I know.  But I do like Monaco 10.

 That's what I use in terminal windows, too. Non-smoothed fonts seem to
 work best when I want a fixed-width font.
 
 I guess I'd better add a way in font% to control smoothing before
 tagging 204.1 (which uses Quartz rendering of text).
 
 Maybe 'modern should be non-smoothed by default?

 MrEd has jumped for v204.1. It was actually a small change, after I
 figured out how to do it. Anyone want another rant about Apple's poor
 docs?

 I do! Maybe we should turn these into a postivie guidelines for our own
 documentation, perhaps as various concrete negative examples?
