This is an annotated match between Kit Woolsey and Jeremy Bagai. Here is an introduction and some instructions:

    A few weeks ago Kit and Jeremy decided it would be a good idea to annotate a match for FIBS players so they could see the thinking processes of the more experienced players.  We played a fairly interesting match, logged it, and then annotated it independently. You will see our reasons for our plays and cube decisions, as well as our second thoughts upon later analysis which often came to a different conclusion than our original choices.

    We then got some unexpected help from two sources.  First of all, Gerry Tesauro volunteered TD-Gammon's valuable help.  TD analyzed the whole match and listed its top three choices for each play along with its estimated equities.  These equities are always assuming a 1-cube and they do not take into account cube ownership.  Thus on a pass-take decision an equity of -.50 would be a break-even decision (not taking cube ownership into account -- that would probably make it a little higher), since that would translate to an equity of -.100 on a 2-cube.  TD was also nice enough to comment on the game, giving its reasons behind its choices as well as getting in a few snide remarks about the our mistakes. In general we have full respect for TD's choices and believe they are likely to be correct; however in end-game positions and positions involving technical plays TD is likely to come up with an incorrect play.

   Our second source of help came from Mark Damish.  He volunteered to format our commentary in the form you now see, with the diagram of the position, roll, move, and then commentary.  This should make for much more enjoyable reading. We hope everybody enjoys this product. We believe all players can benefit from a study of this match and the commentary, by understanding how experts think about backgammon positions.  Also, we have tried to make the commentary enjoyable so it is fun to read through.

        Kit & Jeremy

========

Notes about the format used:
   
   Most of the moves/plays within a game use the following order:
     -- Move #, X or O on roll, Dice. `32:' means a 3 and a 2 were rolled.
     -- Diagram of the position BEFORE the move has been made, numbered
        such that the home board of the person on roll is numbered 6..1.
     -- The move. 24/21 means a piece was moved from the 24 point to the
        the 21 point. 13/4* means a piece was moved from the 13 to the 4
        point, and a blot was hit on the 4 point. `DANCES' means the person
        on roll danced.
     -- Comments by Jeremy, Kit, and TD.

   There are also some comments that occur before the move has been made. These are generally comments about whether to double or not, and the reasoning behind the decision. These comments are enclosed by a `----====' pattern. The best diagram to use when reading this type of comment is the next diagram the follows the comment.

[ Before all such comments -- and real doubles -- I have now inserted another board and the phrase 'Cube action?'; that is, should the player on roll doubled, and, if doubled, should the other player accept the double? S.T. 11/6/94 ]

Suggestions for use:

Display the move and the diagrams, think about what move YOU would make and WHY. Display the move made by the expert and then read their comments. Visualize the board and think about cube actions before the next roll. 

Try to obtain a display. with as many lines as possable (For ms-dos 5+ users with a VGA card, the command 'mode con: lines=50' will give you a 50 line display.

Thanks Kit! Thanks Jeremy! Thanks Gerry!

Enjoy...
     ...Mark

                                      -- Comments by Jeremy, Kit, and TD.
                                       
                                      There are also some comments that occur before the move has been made. These are generally comments about whether to double or not, and the reasoning behind the decision. These comments are encl osed by a `----====' pattern. The best diagram to use when reading this type of comment is the next diagram the follows the comment.
                                      
                                      [ Before all such comments -- and real doubl es -- I have now inserted another board and the phrase 'Cube action?'; that is, should the player on roll doubled, and, if doubled, should the other player accept the double? S.T. 11/6/94 ]

                                               Display the move and the diagrams, think about what move YOU would make and WHY. Display the move made by t he expert and then read their comments. Visualize the board and think about cube actions before the next roll.
