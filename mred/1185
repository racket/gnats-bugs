>Description:
When using set-scale in a canvas's dc% and then drawing a bitmap,
the bitmap is truncated, not scaled.

If this cannot be fixed, I see no good use for exporting set-scale
in sixlib. Does anyone else?
>How-To-Repeat:
(define b (make-object bitmap% 200 200))
(define bdc (make-object bitmap-dc% b))
(send bdc clear)
(send bdc draw-line 0 0 200 200)
(send bdc draw-ellipse 0 0 200 200)
(send bdc set-bitmap #f)

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define c (make-object (class canvas% ()
                         (inherit get-dc)
                         (override
                           [on-paint
                            (lambda ()
                              (send (get-dc) set-scale 1/2 1/2)
                              (send (get-dc) draw-bitmap b 0 0))])
                         (sequence (super-init f)))))
(send c min-width 200)
(send c min-height 200)
(send f show #t)

 This behavior documented, though in draw-bitmap-section rather than
 draw-bitmap. I should probably reverse the documentation and links.

 Not me.
