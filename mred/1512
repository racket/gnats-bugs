>Description:
on the "Snip Classes" page in the MrEd manual, the title is not in
boldface

the page which describes adding menu options to editors uses the
word "optionations" in a way I don't understand.  In fact, it 
would be difficult to use this word in a way I _did_ understand.
Was this deliberate?  ITYM "operations"?

 Apparently it's so deep in the section hierarchy that latex2html
 doesn't think it should be bold. No doubt there's a way to change
 that, [... non-commital pause]

 Right, "operations" - fixed.
