>Description:
While compiling the source code for DrScheme (something I've done many times successfully), I noticed that the compile failed due to the absence of the Athena widget library header files.  My Linux distribution (Debian unstable) has the Athena libraries but doesn't include the header files unless you specifically request them.  It seems to me that the configure script should detect this and abort instead of continuing.  Once I installed the Athena header files the compilation went through without problems.
>How-To-Repeat:
cd src
configure --prefix=/usr/local/plt --enable-shared
make

Reason>>> For now, I've removed the dependency on Xaw headers.
libXaw is still needed, though. (It does something
for keyboard focus, though I don't understand exactly
what.)
