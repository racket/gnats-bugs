>Description:
DrScheme doesn't let me resize a window big enough that it would span two
adjacent monitors, unlike most other classic apps. It appears to stop when
the frame would fill the main monitor.

(this is in addition to the other multiple monitor redraw problems I was
having, mentioned in another pr)
