>Description:
Hi!

Sorry if my english isn't good.

From now: non-english characters = nec

When I load a file made in a text editor like Notepad or Editplus, then the nec (like á é ñ) looks like the symbol "?".
When I save the loaded file, DrScheme changes all nec to "?" (they are now "?" when I open the file with a text editor).

Curiously, if I type the nec inside DrScheme and then save the file, the nec are OK and when I load the file (even after a program restart) the nec are there.

I didn´t had that problem with DrScheme 209.

I use nec only in comments.


Thanks for your time and thanks for DrScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a new scm file with Notepad.
2. Copy the following comment in the file:

; Función numérica

3. Save the file and open it with DrScheme 300.

If you have the same problem, the previos comment looks like:

; Funci?n num?rica

 (Your original characters have been mangled by our bug-report system,
 but I get the idea.)
 
 DrScheme currently reads and writes text using UTF-8, always. This
 encourages portability, but obviously isn't best for all users. We will
 continue to work on this issue.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
 


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:44:58 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
