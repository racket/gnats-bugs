>Description:
	
Running Check Syntax on a program makes the Save button in drscheme
forget when the program change.  That is, the Save button doesn't
reappear when it should.

It seems to require Checking Syntax to produce the bug.
But Save does appear after typing new text.
So far, I've only seen the problem with C-w or Delete from Edit menu.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
Start drscheme.
Enter:  (define foo (lambda (n) (+ n 2)))
Check Syntax
Save to file.
Delete "foo" by dragging mouse and typing C-w or using Delete 
from the Edit menu.
The Save button doesn't appear.

Upon exiting, it warns me that the program is not saved,
so it's just the Save button that's not noticing the change.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

This seems to be a problem with the set-modified method on
wx:media-edits. From my understanding, when I evaluate this:

(define e%
  (class-asi wx:media-edit%
    (rename [super-set-modified set-modified])
    (public
      (set-modified
       (lambda (mod?)
	 (printf "edit modified: ~s~n" mod?)
	 (super-set-modified mod?))))))
      
(define f (make-object wx:frame% '() "hi" 0 0 200 200))
(define p (make-object wx:panel% f))
(define c (make-object wx:media-canvas% p))
(define e (make-object e%))
(send c set-media e)
(send e insert "abcdefghijklmnopq")
(send f show #t)

and I type in the edit I should see some printouts, but I don't.

There was a bug with set-modified. It was fixed before the 49 release.
