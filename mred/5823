>Description:
When the french keyboard is set, the editor doesn't seem to behave properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
in the system preferences, in international, in keyboard menu,
add in the French keyboard and restart DrScheme (should that
be necessary?).

After drs restarts, choose the French keyboard. Asuming
you have an American keyboard actually connected, type:

  shift-[ (aka left curly bracket)
  q       

you should at this point see an a with an umlaut on it.
keep typing the q key and you will see more and more
a-umlauts.

There are two problems with this:

  - you should only get one a-umlaut
  - the insertion point seems to move
    to the middle of the a-umlauts,
    event tho new keystrokes are going
    at the end.
