>Description:
Run the program below and type alt-u followed by o. You should get รถ (an o with an umlaut) but you don't. Also, try this in text edit and you see some fancy stuff happening.

(define t (new text%))
(define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200] [height 100]))
(define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
(send f show #t)
(send ec focus)
