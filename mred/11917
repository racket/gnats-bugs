 I believe this bug has been fixed since the latest release. If you'd
 like to try a pre-release, you can either download the source of get a
 nightly build here:

 Unfortunately, you're thinking of a Mac-related repair, not a Gtk one.
 
 One obstacle is that I haven't been able to replicate the problem on my
 machine, although it has been reported several times. I hope to
 investigate more soon.
