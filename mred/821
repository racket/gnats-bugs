>Environment:
AIX
>Description:
After installing, mzscheme and drscheme-jr
seem to operate correctly, but drscheme reports
the following fatal error during startup:

        0509-037 System error - error data is: /u/cs/class/cs131/cs131ta/src/plt/.bin/rs6k-aix/mred
        0509-027 Member shr4.o is not found or file is not an archive.
        0509-027 Member shr4.o is not found or file is not an archive.
        0509-022 Cannot load library libXt.a[shr4.o].
        0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.

I've started to try to build drscheme from source, but I'm
afraid that seas.ucla.edu is a little bit mixed up as far
as building X11 goes.  I've run into a few portability glitches
with AIX 4.1.1 and will send them in one glop when I'm done
(either successfully, or giving up).
>How-To-Repeat:
I followed the unpacking instructions for
plt.rs6k-aix-xt.tar.gz,
and put plt it into my home
directory rather than into /usr/local/bin.
I then invoked `drscheme'.

Eggert re-built DrScheme from source, and apparently it works fine.
