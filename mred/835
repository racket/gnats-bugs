>Description:
The get-top-level-focus-window procedure always returns #f when a frame is frontmost and raises an error when a dialog is frontmost.

>How-To-Repeat:
;; frames
> (define f (make-object frame% "test"))
#<void>
> (send f show #t)
#<void>
> (begin (sleep 4) (get-top-level-focus-window))  ;; here bring f to front.
#f



;; dialogs:

> (define d (make-object dialog% "test"))
> (begin  (thread (lambda () (sleep 3) (printf "~a~n" (get-top-level-focus-window)))) (send d show #t))
ivar: instance variable not found: act-on? in class: frame%
#<void>

 Quoting robby@cs.rice.edu:

 Moving the focus requires an event, which won't happen while you sleep.
 What if you replace `sleep' with `sleep/yield'?

 In this case, you're doing something like sleep/yield; I think I know
 what the Mac-specific problem is, and I'll try to fix it from here.

 I commited - but not tagged - a new mred.cxx. Can you check out the
 untagged plt/src/mred/mred.cxx and see whether it compiles and fixes
 the problem? As soon as we have a version that works, I'll exp-tag it.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
