There are all kinds of problems with the text size, the cursor, selecting text, etc.  Additionally, the program crashes when I try to change the font.  It's the same on any 10.3 computer I've tried.

 Hm. I wonder if there is something specific to your system or something
 about the preferences. I use it on os x 10.3 on a daily basis without
 problems.
 
 Perhaps you can explain yourself a bit better? Also, can you please
 send the stack trace when you get a crash?

 Seems like two problems: the default font and the funny behavior. Is
 that right? Are either of these DrScheme problems?
 
 (I will forward the archive separately)

 I belive that ".Aqua..." is a mangled name for a Unicode font for a
 non-Roman language. Most likely, the mangled name prevents MrEd from
 properly obtaining the font, so the actual font used for drawing or
 measuring is whatever used to be there.
 
 No doubt MrEd should be checking an error code somewhere, then backing
 out to a default when the font load fails. (The mangled-name problem
 will be fixed as soon as we have unicode support.)

 It's possible (likely!) that there is a bug somewhere, but I cannot
 seem to figure out how this guy got that as the default font (ie, he
 should have had to set the font to that somewhere).
 
 Anyways, I've now made sure that
 
   (get-family-builtin-face 'modern)
 
 is the first font in the choice list, just in case that is somehow
 correlated (the .Aqua one was the first one before).
 
 So, in the meantime before supporting unicode, would it make sense to
 have a function that actually returned the valid monospaced fonts, that
 was built into mred? Perhaps adapting get-face-list?
 
 It might not be hard to implement -- perhaps mred could use the code in
 the framework (editor:get-fixed-faces) and filter out the ones it knows
 are wierd?

 Yes, I think most platforms provide that kind of font query (though old
 X definitelky doesn't). It's on my list.

 I've been using the entire font list for X, anyways. Computing the list
 of fixed width fonts was too expensive.

 Unless I hear any reason not to, I will close this thing shortly.
 (Seems like plenty of people use OSX with no problems now.)
