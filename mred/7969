>Description:
when typing bidirectional text (for example, hebrew or arabic) the text is displayed left-to-right. that is not the correct behaviour - as with every other text field, it should align hebrew text right to left.

this limits students abilities to comment their programs using their native language.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. start dr. scheme
2. switch keyboard layout to hebrew (or arabic)
3. type some text and note it is not properly aligned.

this is on a hebrew-enabled WinXP build, but may as well affect localized WinXP builds as wells.

We've considered doing bidi text for DrScheme for a short
while, but it looks like this will be too difficult to do
for now.

(Matthew, I'm marking it as analyzed.)
