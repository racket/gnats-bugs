>Description:
DrScheme windows won't expand beyond
about 850 pixels high in MacOS X version
208.1-cvs9aug2004.
(It's possible that this is a little
trickier; maybe this only happens on
two-monitor systems and the limit is 
the height of the main monitor.  I do
this on a PowerBook with a second
monitor.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Launch DrScheme on a system
with a monitor taller than
about 850 pixels.
Drag the resize corner to try
to make the window taller than
850 pixels.

 My surmise above was right.  When
 I have a large monitor connected to
 my PowerBook and I make that monitor
 my main monitor, the DrScheme windows
 can fill the larger space.  It seems that
 DrScheme takes its limits from the size
 of the main monitor when DrScheme
 was launched.
 
 That makes this behavior less serious,
 since there's a workaround.  Still, the
 user should always be able to expand
 a window to the size of the second
 monitor, whether or not it's the main one.
