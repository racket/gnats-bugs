>Description:
Mac Users with UK keyboards cannot generate the symbol '#' (unicode 0023) in DrScheme. (you can use another editor - then cut and paste, or change your keyboard layout to US - but that doesn't match the UK keys)

The apple osx keybinding is Alt (or option) 3 - but this just generated the character 3.

Is it possible to use the apple keybindings, as I imagine this is not the only thing that is affected, failing that add alt+3 to the defaults for DrScheme/MrEd? (#t and #f are difficult without it!)

press Alt (or option) 3 in DrScheme

 This seems like a big problem. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reproduce
 the problem just by changing my keyboard layout to "British" ---
 Shift-3 produces Â£ and Option-3 produces # with my U.S. keyboard in
 British mode --- so I'm stumped for the moment.
 
 If you have time, could you try running
 
   http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/trunk/collects/tests/mred/showkey.ss
 
 in MrEd or DrScheme, and send me the output for when you press various
 key combinations with the 3 key, including combinations with Command?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Sorry -
 I had 'treat option key as meta' turned on in the general editor
 preferences in DrScheme.
 
 use option+command+3 to generate a # on a UK Keyboard/Location.
