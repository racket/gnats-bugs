>Description:
when clicked within either an empty scroll bar area, or around the
fringe of a scroll bar or buttons, select-none-events are generated,
which isn't nessisarity so bad, but in the process it erroneously 
deselects any slected list items which were previously selected.

(idealy, no select-events should likely be generated from clicks within
 the scrolling area; futher it would also be nice to have list items
 scroll automaticaly if the mouse is dragged beyond presently visable
 list elements; and finally wonder if Apple has finally remedied some
 their list-box limitations, obsoleteing the nessisity for A-List?)
>How-To-Repeat:
try:

(require (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))

(define my-frame (instantiate frame% ("frame" #f 200 250)))

(define my-list '("zero" "one" "two" "three" "four" "five" "six" "seven" "eight"))

(define (my-selection list-box control-event)
  (let ((selection (send list-box get-selection)) (event (send control-event get-event-type)))
    (printf "~s ~s\n" selection event)
    ))

(define my-listbox (instantiate list-box% (#f my-list my-frame my-selection '(single) 0 #t 16 16)))

(send my-frame show #t)

State-Changed-Why:
    This should be fixed, finally, in the exp-tagged code.
    No select events are generated when clicking in empty or
    scroll space within a list.
    
    The no-scroll-when-dragging problem is still there, and
    I'll save that for another day.
