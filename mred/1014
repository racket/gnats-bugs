	(define bm-dc (make-object bitmap-dc%))

	I expect to see 1, but get a 255

 Quoting Matthias Felleisen:

 Technically, it's relevant. If the BM were black and white, the
 behavior you see would be correct.

 The problem was probably that BM was already in use or not OK for some
 reason, so the DC wasn't really operational. It would be nice if
 `clear', `set-background', etc. gave an error message like "DC not
 ready"; I'll have to see whether this is feasible.
