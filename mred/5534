>Description:
The option-based characters (eg accents, greek letters,
copywright symbols, etc) don't come out right under MacOS X.
>How-To-Repeat:
type opt-e followed by e. You should get an 
accent on top of the e, but you get a square box.

Worse, the box doesn't sit in the place a normal character
would sit -- insertion and cursor position are messed
up in the vicinity of the character.
