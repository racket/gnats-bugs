>Description:
Selecting the "DrScheme"/"Quit DrScheme" menu item generates:
"wxWindows Fatal Error No wwxMenu for wxMenuBar", followed by:
"The application DrScheme has unexpected quit" which does not
occure if "File"/"Quit cmd-Q" is seleted via the file menu; which for
OSX apps should have been replaced by the former.

However it's odd that when an error message is viewed in the
"Standard Output" DrScheme window, the "DrScheme"/"Quit"
DrScheme cmd-Q" item is properly displayed with the cmd-Q
shortcut assocated with it, and the redundant "File"/"Quit cmd-Q"
is appropriatly not present, but reverts back to the improper display
of the "File"/"Quit cmd-Q" menu item listings when the main
Definition/Interacton window is selected?

And while on the subject, when viewing the "Standard Output"
window, there's no "Windows" menu list, nor is the "Standard
Output" window listed in the properly present "Windows" menu list
when viewing the Defintion/Interactions window?

 As a hopefully helpful observation: as DrScheme is starting up,
 if you look within the DrScheme menu, the "Quit DrScheme cmd-Q"
 menu item placement is correct, but upon finishing the startup
 process, the menu item appears to be incorrectly overridden by
 OS8/9 menu item placement?
