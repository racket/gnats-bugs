>Description:
docs say this:

9.5  editor-canvas%

Implements: canvas<%>

An editor-canvas% object manages and displays a text% or pasteboard% object.

*(instantiate editor-canvas% () (parent _) [(editor _)] [(style _)] [(scrolls-per-page _)] [(enabled _)] [(vert-margin _)] [(horiz-margin _)] [(min-width _)] [(min-height _)] [(stretchable-width _)] [(stretchable-height _)] [(label _)]) -> editor-canvas% object

>How-To-Repeat:
but mred responds with this:

> (instantiate editor-canvas% ()
    (parent (instantiate frame% () (label "frame")))
    (editor (instantiate text% ())))
instantiate: unused initialization arguments: (editor #(struct:object:text% ...)) for instantiated class: editor-canvas%

 Fixed in collects/mred/mred.ss. (The code still had "buffer".)
