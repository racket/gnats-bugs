>Description:
It would be very convenient if upon opening a DrScheme generated document or project file, that they would be opened within the context of DrScheme, instead of MrEd.

I understand that MrEd is really the target application, but there should be a mechanism such that MrEd can query the creator tag, and then first invoke the DrSheme configuration first on behalf the DrScheme document which generated the open-document request.

Additionally, it would be nice if DrScheme didn't require an open document widow at all times, such that it can either be configured to open without a default document as a preference, and such that closing the last document did not terminate the DrScheme/MrEd application.

(I don't know if these are presently Mac limitations, but the user environment would be enhanced without these idiosyncrasies. Thanks for your consideration.)

 Thank you for your interest in DrScheme! We have been planning to add 
 all of the features you ask for, for quite some time. It would be 
 great if we get them done for 104, but I am not sure that we will be 
 able to get to all of them.
 
 Thanks,
