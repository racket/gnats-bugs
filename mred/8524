>Description:
Generating multi page .ps files seems to be broken.

When running the code below I get a .ps file that only seems
to contain a the first page's worth of stuff (the second 
and third pages are blank).

Altho this suggests there is something wrong with the second
and onwards pages (and there might be) the original program
I started with actually showed ps on multiple pages, but 
the bounding boxes seemed to be messed up there. I couldn't
make that happen by messing around a little bit -- only
the blank pages happened in the smaller setting.

 EPS files can't have multiple pages. Pass #f as the `as-eps' (4th)
 initialization argument to post-script-dc%.

Reason>>> Changed MrEd to report an error if `start-page' is used more than
once for EPS output, in addition to new errors when drawing methods

 It's not a question of bounding boxes. The EPS file format is like PS,
 except with a single page (and some other constraints).

 Ah ....
 
 I guess it would be problematic to just union the bounding boxes or
 something like that?

 Oh. Okay.
