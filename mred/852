>Description:

file|quit doesn't always work when messing with the parameterization.

>How-To-Repeat:

1) put the following code in a file, tmp.ss
2) type "mred -f tmp.ss" on the command line
3) type alt-q and mred locks up.

  (define top-parameterization (current-parameterization))
  (define system-parameterization (make-parameterization top-parameterization))
  (define eval-thread-parameterization
    (make-parameterization-with-sharing 
     system-parameterization
     system-parameterization
     (list current-exception-handler)
     (lambda (x) #f)))
  (define system-custodian (current-custodian))

  (current-parameterization system-parameterization)

  (parameterization-branch-handler
   (lambda ()
     (make-parameterization-with-sharing 
      system-parameterization
      system-parameterization
      (list current-exception-handler)
      (lambda (x) #f))))

  (define system-eventspace (make-eventspace))
  (current-eventspace system-eventspace)

 The problem is that grepl creates an eventspace for the user, and lets
 the current branch handler define tha parameterization. The example
 code sets the branch handler so that the grepl's eventspace for the
 grepl is changed to the user's eventspace (because the eventspace
 parameter is shared). Deadlock occurs because the interaction between
 threads is not what graphical-read-eval-print-loop expects.
 
 Here's a slightly smaller program that illustrates the problem:
 
   (parameterization-branch-handler
    (lambda ()
      (make-parameterization-with-sharing
       (current-parameterization)
       (current-parameterization)
       null void)))
 
 Loading this with -f causes MrEd to hang without even refreshing the
 grepl frame.
 
 The solution is probably better documentation and/or giving the grepl
 caller more control over how the user eventspace is created.

 Why is this useful?
 
 Why doesn't the grepl protect against everything, just like the
 drscheme repl does? It seems like we can protect the grepl's window
 against everything except a non-tail-recursive infinite loop. 
 
 As the developer of drscheme who will probably be forced to use the
 grepl to examine drscheme itself, I would like strong guarantees that
 the grepl will survive whatever mistakes I make, so I have a chance of
 understanding what has happened.
