>Description:
When maximizing (with the plus button) a DrScheme window, the actual window resizes correctly, but the definitions and interactions panes stay the same size as they were before.  The panes get resized correctly after a maximization only if the window is then minimized into the dock and reopened. The panes do however resize correctly when the window is resized by dragging.  If it helps, I am using Panther. I have never used DrScheme on any other version of OS X so I don't know if this is a new issue or not.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. resize the DrScheme window so that it will be very noticable when you maximize it
2. maximize the window
