>Description:
When setting the font to symbol for the letters
"abcdef", the postscript version of the output
looses the letters. The displayed version looks
fine, tho.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define t (make-object text%))
(define c (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send t insert "abcdef")
(send t change-style (send (make-object style-delta%) set-delta-face "symbol") 0 6)
(send t print #t #t 'postscript)
(send f show #t)

;; The postscript is wrong. The second to last LucidaSans should
;; be symbol. Making this change makes the postscript look right.

 This is also a problem under X. There, I have to set the font to
 "-adobe-symbol", but once I have done that, the same behavior
 persists. I didn't look at the postscript files (since it goes
 directly to ghostview, under X)

 Even changing the program to this:
 
 (define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
 (define t (make-object text%))
 (define c (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
 (send t insert "abcdef")
 (define s (make-object style-delta%))
 (send s  set-family 'swiss)
 (send t change-style s 0 6)
 (send t print #t #t 'postscript)
 (send f show #t)
 
 and setting the swiss family to by symbol doesn't work (again, the
 display works, but the postscript doesn't)
 
 PS: What is the purpose of swiss? We never seem to use it. Perhaps it
 could be allocated to symbol by default? (I don't know what the symbol
 font under windows is, but there must be something we can use?)

 It's not so much that the font is lost - MrEd never knew it in the
 first place.
 
 MrEd only has PostScript mappings for the built in font "families". To
 map Symbol, you'd have to edit the .mred.resources (or mred.ini, etc.)
 file, like this:
 
  *Screen@Symbol__: +-adobe-symbol${ScreenStdSuffix}
  *Afm@Symbol__: Symb
  *PostScript@Symbol__: Symbol
 
 and you need to add Symb.afm in plt/collects/afm.
 
 For 101/6, I've added set-post-script-name, etc. to
 the-font-name-directory<%>. So Scheme code will be able to do the job:
 
 (let ([id (send the-font-name-directory find-or-create-font-id 
 		"Symbol" 'modern)])
   (send the-font-name-directory set-post-script-name 
 	id 'normal 'normal "Symbol")
   (send the-font-name-directory set-afm-name
 	id 'normal 'normal "Symb")
   (when (eq? (system-type) 'unix)
     (send the-font-name-directory set-screen-name
 	  id 'normal 'normal
 	  "-adobe-symbol-medium-r-normal-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*")))
 
 You'll still need Symb.afm in plt/collects/afm, of course.

 Can you add Symb.afm (and the associated mappings) into the default
 mred setup? This seems generally useful, given the speciality of
 symbol and the fact that it was on all three platforms by default
 (well, _someone_ set it up everywhere, just not me (and I spuspect
 that this is case for all windows and mac platforms)

 Added a 'symbol family to 101/6.
 
 Unfortunately, there will probably be some minor compilation problems
 on the Mac. Let me know.

 It seems to have worked fine.
