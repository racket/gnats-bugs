Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt at Wed, 08 Apr 2009 14:07:25 -0400
Reason>>> mred

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 08 Apr 2009 14:07:25 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

The problem was related to the rewrite in v4.1.5 for
waiting on network-socket activity (which is related to
waiting on subprocesses).

Thanks for the report!
