>Description:
The various set-size methods of container classes are documented
to take 5 arguments (coordinates and a fifth arg FLAGS).  At least
the MrEd methods all seem to take only 4.

I suspect it's the documentation which needs fixing.

 True, but the solution in MrEd 100 is to eliminate set-size entirely.
 
 Given that set-size will disappear, I'm curious whether you can you do
 what you're doing by deriving a new panel class?
