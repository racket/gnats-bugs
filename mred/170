>Description:
sometimes:

   (send wx:the-brush-list find-or-create-brush <color> wx:const-solid)

returns null. I got it to return null for these colors:

bad color: DARK GREY
bad color: MEDIUM FOREST GREEN
bad color: MEDIUM GOLDENROD

I did it by creating brushes for all of these colors:

(list "AQUAMARINE" "BLACK" "BLUE" "BLUE VIOLET" "BROWN" "CADET BLUE"
      "CORAL" "CORNFLOWER BLUE" "CYAN" "DARK GREY" "DARK GREEN" 
      "DARK OLIVE GREEN" "DARK ORCHID" "DARK SLATE BLUE" "DARK SLATE GREY"
      "DARK TURQUOISE" "DIM GREY" "FIREBRICK" "FOREST GREEN" "GOLD" 
      "GOLDENROD" "GREY" "GREEN" "GREEN YELLOW" "INDIAN RED" "KHAKI" 
      "LIGHT BLUE" "LIGHT GREY" "LIGHT STEEL BLUE" "LIME GREEN" "MAGENTA"
      "MAROON" "MEDIUM AQUAMARINE" "MEDIUM BLUE" "MEDIUM FOREST GREEN"
      "MEDIUM GOLDENROD" "MEDIUM ORCHID" "MEDIUM SEA GREEN"
      "MEDIUM SLATE BLUE" "MEDIUM SPRING GREEN" "MEDIUM TURQUOISE" 
      "MEDIUM VIOLET RED" "MIDNIGHT BLUE" "NAVY" "ORANGE" "ORANGE RED"
      "ORCHID" "PALE GREEN" "PINK" "PLUM" "PURPLE" "RED" "SALMON"
      "SEA GREEN" "SIENNA" "SKY BLUE" "SLATE BLUE" "SPRING GREEN"
      "STEEL BLUE" "TAN" "THISTLE" "TURQUOISE" "VIOLET" "VIOLET RED"
      "WHEAT" "WHITE" "YELLOW" "YELLOW GREEN")

and seeing if anything comes back null.

>How-To-Repeat:

(define colors
(list "AQUAMARINE" "BLACK" "BLUE" "BLUE VIOLET" "BROWN" "CADET BLUE"
      "CORAL" "CORNFLOWER BLUE" "CYAN" "DARK GREY" "DARK GREEN" 
      "DARK OLIVE GREEN" "DARK ORCHID" "DARK SLATE BLUE" "DARK SLATE GREY"
      "DARK TURQUOISE" "DIM GREY" "FIREBRICK" "FOREST GREEN" "GOLD" 
      "GOLDENROD" "GREY" "GREEN" "GREEN YELLOW" "INDIAN RED" "KHAKI" 
      "LIGHT BLUE" "LIGHT GREY" "LIGHT STEEL BLUE" "LIME GREEN" "MAGENTA"
      "MAROON" "MEDIUM AQUAMARINE" "MEDIUM BLUE" "MEDIUM FOREST GREEN"
      "MEDIUM GOLDENROD" "MEDIUM ORCHID" "MEDIUM SEA GREEN"
      "MEDIUM SLATE BLUE" "MEDIUM SPRING GREEN" "MEDIUM TURQUOISE" 
      "MEDIUM VIOLET RED" "MIDNIGHT BLUE" "NAVY" "ORANGE" "ORANGE RED"
      "ORCHID" "PALE GREEN" "PINK" "PLUM" "PURPLE" "RED" "SALMON"
      "SEA GREEN" "SIENNA" "SKY BLUE" "SLATE BLUE" "SPRING GREEN"
      "STEEL BLUE" "TAN" "THISTLE" "TURQUOISE" "VIOLET" "VIOLET RED"
      "WHEAT" "WHITE" "YELLOW" "YELLOW GREEN"))

(for-each (lambda (color)
            (when (null? (send wx:the-brush-list find-or-create-brush
			       color wx:const-solid))
	      (printf "bad-color: ~a~n" color)))
          colors)

State-Changed-When: Mon Jun  9 14:19:10 1997
State-Changed-Why:

The manual has been corrected to note that find-or-create-pen/brush
can return null when a bad color name is provided.

After the next release, the Xt and Motif versions of MrEd will always
find the standard names documented in the manual, even if the X11 file
rgb.txt omits any of the name. However, rgb.txt values will be used
when present for a name.
