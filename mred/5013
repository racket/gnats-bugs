 This also happens with esc-f (forward word).

State-Changed-Why:
    MrEd now uses the default locale (insteda of the "C" locale)
    to initialize the wordbreak map. That fixes the problem
    for me (even with "en_US").
    
    If you build the currently exp-tagged code, does it work
    for you?
    
    Thanks,
    Matthew
