>Description:
Suppose a page contains a tall image.
        Scrolling downward (w/ PgDn)
        works fine, but scrolling back
        upward halts at the top of the image
        even if there is text above the image
        on the page.
>How-To-Repeat:
The DrScheme tour pages with the large
    screen dumps exhibit this property.
