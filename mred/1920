>Description:
When dropping multiple files on the mac, one of the files
is dropped multiple times, instead of the different files.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; 1. evaluate this:

(define f (make-object
              (class frame% ()
                (override
                  [on-drop-file
                   (lambda (x)
                     (printf "dropped: ~s~n" x))])
                (sequence
                  (super-init "frame" #f 200 200)))))
(send f accept-drop-files #t)
(send f show #t)

;; 2. make sure that the frame is front most
;;    switch to the finder and select more than one file
;;    double clikc on the files (maybe you have to repeat this
;;    it doesn't take the first time, due to another bug)
;; 3. see one of the file's paths printed multiple times.
;;    expect to see each filename printed once.

 New mred.cxx committed and v200-tagged. It should fix the problem for
 199.X, though obviously I can't test it.
