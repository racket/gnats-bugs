Reason>>> I'm pretty sure this (64-bit-specific) problem has been fixed.
Let me know if you still see the problem with v5.1.3.7 or
later.

 On the latest build, 5.3.1.7 (compiled from source Friday on the latest clone), Lion is still not bringing forward the splash screen on startup nor the initial window.   Window --> Bring Frame to Front... does work as expected once DrRacket is done with the splash screen.  Interestingly, "open <file>.rkt" will launch DrRacket as expected form terminal, but it fails to open the specified file as expected.  I wonder if the two are somehow related...
 
 All the best.

 Thanks for checking. We've found and fixed one more problem since
 Friday, so hopefully building the latest will fix the problem. Let me
 know if your next build *still* has problems.

 No joy.  The splash appeared once, but not again.  In this state where the windows are not visible, any additional window opened is similarly hidden until the Windows menu is used to "Bring Frames to Front..."  Also, opening a file from spotlight or the terminal, still does not open the file in DrRacket.

 At the risk of stretching your patience too far, I'd like to take it
 from the top...
 
 Are you building for 32-bit mode (the default) or 64-bit mode (using `configure --enable-mac64')?
 
 In
 
  DrRacket.app/Contents/Info.plist
 
 does it say
 
  <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key><string>org.racket-lang.DrRacket</string>
 
 or
 
  <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key><string>org.racket-lang.DrRacket-64</string>
 
 ?
 
 Whichever one it says, if you change the part in `<string>...</string>
 (maybe by adding "X") does it change the way DrRacket behaves?
 
 Thanks!
