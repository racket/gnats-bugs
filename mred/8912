>Description:
Killing a custodian can cause drscheme (and presumably mred)
to exit with a wx-windows error dialog about not 
having a parent.
>How-To-Repeat:
  (define printer-dc (make-object printer-dc% #f))
  (send printer-dc start-doc "")
  (send printer-dc start-page)

click "preview" on the window that comes up.
Then click "cancel" (the window still stays)
type cmd-k to kill the custodian
see a wx windows dialog and click ok
in it to make drscheme exit.

Reason>>> It's not really about killing. Cmd-V also causes the crash for me.

The problem is that, when handling certain kinds of events,
MrEd notices a window on the screen and doesn't know where
it came from.

The solution for now is to just supress the print-status
dialog. That solves lots of other problems, such as the
modal print-status dialog blocking mouse events to all
MrEd eventspaces.

 Should we make a scheme-level print-cancelling dialog? Say for drs?
