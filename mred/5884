>Description:
specificly:
- DrScheme/Quit DrScheme, still doesn't work, but use to.
- File/Close, use to work in the absents of above, but now not only
doesn't, but for some reason also displays the "File/Save Others"
sub-list items as well?
- File/Open Recent, menu list (when containing items with long paths
fully obscures the parent menu, such that it can't be navigated, I
don't remember seeing this problem before.
- finally the font menu in the preferences winow displays some werd
font names for example: .Aqua(some garbage), PC#(some garbage)

 Fixed last night. This morning's binaries should work properly.

 Properly displaying a font name requires using the named font, or
 something like that. I'll fix it eventually.
