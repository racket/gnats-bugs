>Release:        version 51
>Organization:
titan
>Environment:
MS Windows NT
>Description:
I downloaded the two files to install DrScheme from your Web page: plt.exe and plt.w02

I then move these files onto another computer via two floppies and used them to install DrScheme.

DrScheme is installed on a dual pentium box running Windows NT Workstation.

Whenever I attempt to save or load a file, DrScheme hangs.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrScheme (version 51).
2. In the definitions pane type something:
; this is a comment
3. Click on the save button.

Results:
DrScheme goes off to lala land and I have to use taskmanager to kill it.

State-Changed-Why:

I fairly certain I know what the problem is. The file dialog is a mess
because Windows wants the dialog to change the working directory and
DrScheme wants the working directory to stay put. In an attempt to
work around this perverse behavior of the OS, DrScheme plays a lot of
games with threads and priorities.

The problem will be elimiated in 52. Internally, 52 will handle the
working directory differently. Windows can do whatever it wants and it
won't bother DrScheme, so all the tricky thread stuff (which
apparently doesn't work with multiple porcessors) can be removed.
