>Description:
I would like to be able to say "no" when a child is added to a
panel (with an error message). 

I want to use this to ensure that all children of the
framework's single-panel implement window<%>. Below is my
best attempt. Seems like it should work, but even if it
isn't allowed, the error message isn't very clear.

>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "list.ss"))
(define p%
  (class horizontal-panel%
    (inherit change-children)
    (define/override (after-new-child c)
      (change-children
       (lambda (l)
         (remq c l))))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define p (make-object p% f))
(make-object pane% p)

change-children: cannot make non-window area inactive in #<struct:object:p%>: #<struct:object:/home/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects/mzlib/class100.ss:155:18>

 From the `change-children' docs:
 
  Takes a filter procedure and changes the container's list of active
  children. [...]
 
  Since non-window areas cannot be hidden, non-window areas cannot be
  made inactive. If the filter procedure removes non-window subareas, an
  exception is raised and the set of active children is not changed.
 
 Any suggestions on making the docs or the error message more clear?
 
 
 Rejecting a new subarea is tricky enough that it will have to wait for
 201.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I didn't realize that non-window<%> areas cannot be removed like that.
 The docs seem clear; I just thought that I knew them....
 
 As far as the error message, if you made it non-window<%> instead of
 non-window that would help. Also, "inactive" isn't a good word. I would
 suggest something like this:
 
   change-children: result list of input function must contain all
   non-window<%> children that the input list did.
 
 or
 
   change-children: can only remove children that implement window<%>, attempted 
   to remove ~e
 
 (with the ~e filled in by the removed non-window<%>)
 
 or something like that.
