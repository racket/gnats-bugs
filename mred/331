>Organization:

>Environment:
MS Windows NT
>Description:
The get-key-press function seems to wait forever. The program which does
this is cited below. (DrScheme, Windows NT. We had the same problem
with the previous versions, and I have perhaps informed you
already about it, but using a different channel).


Besides that the documentation seems a little buggy here: the description
of keyboard events seems to be copied/pasted from the precedent page,
devoted to mouse events, and there some incongruities therein.


Thank you, I love you all anyway, and we like the PLT package very much.
>How-To-Repeat:
 (define (kbrtest)
     (open-graphics)
     (let ((f (open-viewport "title" 100 100)))
  (viewport-flush-input f)
 (key-value (get-key-press f))))

;;; Of course, repeating these steps outside a procedure does not change
;;; anything.
