>Description:
This one is strange enough that it might be due to the changes in dealing with
keyboard events.  If I start a new bug report, then without typing anything, I tab
my focus to the "Submit" button and hit space, I get the warning about the empty
summary twice.  I then fill in the summary and do the same, and again I get the
warning about empty description and steps twice.

It doesn't happen when I use the mouse to click the button.  Also, it happens for
me on XP, but not on linux.
