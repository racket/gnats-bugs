>Description:
While editing, I got the following error message:

attempt to use an invalidated object (class unknown)

>How-To-Repeat:
To the best of my recollection, I did the following:

The cursor was to the right of an sexp.  I hit shift-opt-left to select the
sexp, and then typed a left-paren to begin replacing the highlighted text.
I got the error message shown above.

Attempts to duplicate this error have failed.
