>Description:
Seriously non-critical. When opening a new file into a new tab, the mouse pointer doesn't change to the "text" pointer until the editor loses focus.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set DrRacket to open files in new tabs. Open a file. Hover the mouse pointer over the editor; notice that the mouse pointer isn't the "text" pointer. Click anywhere on the editor; the mouse pointer still hasn't changed. Click on a menu item, tab, anything to make the editor lose focus. Hover over the editor again; the mouse pointer is now the "text" pointer.
