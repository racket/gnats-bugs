>Description:
	
I opened a read-only file in drscheme and tried to edit it.
All of my attempts at changing the file were ignored, but I
got no feeback that the problem was a read-only file.

It would be nice if DrScheme gave me some indication about why
it was ignoring my edits.  (I was about to send-pr that Comment Out
was broken.)  Either a one-time pop-up message, or "read-only" 
next to the file name would be nice.

This applies to typing text, Edit menu, Scheme menu, etc.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

There are several modes that drsscheme frames can get into that are
invisible to the user (and have been for at least 2 releases)
- overwrite mode
- the mode where moving the cursor extends the selection
- and as you noticed read-only mode.

I have planned on my todolist to make a little icon bar at the bottom of
the frame to display that, but it won't happen for this release.

 A beep might be nice, too.

 Something like the latter is preferable, just the way Emacs does it.
 (Of course Emacs's actual convention is terrible, but the idea of
 constantly reminding someone is good.)

State-Changed-When: Mon Jun  2 16:34:52 1997
State-Changed-Why:

I added a status line that displays all of the modalities of edits that I
know of (others anyone?):

- anchor mode (control-space toggles this on and off, it's similar to
               emacs's control-space)
- overwrite mode (meta-o toggles)
- locked (read-only files are locked)

In addition, since there was space, I added line and column information and
a clock.

All of this can be turned off (to save space in the frame) with your
preferences. 

Comments welcome!
