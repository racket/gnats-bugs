>Description:
The carriage return (enter) key does not work in the editor, although it works fine in the immediate window. Do note that I have a laptop that reports a raw keystroke for the enter key corresponding to the 'Enter' of the numeric keypad (I discover that while playing with Tcl).

Any help getting Dr. Scheme up and running will be appreciated--it looks like a fine tool.

Many thanks and best regards, afm

 FWIW, enter works for me, under macos x.

 I'll check whether the numpad enter is mis-reported as #\return under
 OS X. It seems to be consistently 'numpad-enter in Windows and Linux.
 
 I've added "numpadenter" as a keymap keyword (as an alternative to
 "\3"). Strangely, "numpad0" was also missing.
