(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(define p (make-object horizontal-panel% f))
(define b1 (make-object button% "button" p void))
(define b2 (make-object button% "show" f (lambda x (send p change-children
(lambda (l) (list b1))))))
(send p change-children (lambda (l) null))
(send b1 enable #f)
(send f show #t)

;; but it is not drawn greyed out.
