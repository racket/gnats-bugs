>Description:
The program below doesn't seem to ever
get to the printf call, but I think that 
moving the mouse in and out of the window
should trigger printfs.

(This is under windows; didn't try mac os x)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/gui

(define t (new (class text%

                     (printf "got leaving evt\n"))
                   (super on-event evt))
                 (super-new))))
(define f (new frame% [width 200] [height 200] [label ""]))
(define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
