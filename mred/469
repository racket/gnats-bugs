>Description:
After entering code to the interactive environment of Mr. Ed, I attempt
to save the code that I have entered thus far. Upon trying to reload that
file, I find that Mr. Ed won't take it because it is not pure text. 
Double checking from an MS-DOS window, the file was saved with extra
garbage characters of some kind. If I instead use a separate text editor
to compose the program, and the Mr. Ed load utility to load the file, 
everything work's fine. It is only when I save using Mr. Ed. 

Thanks,
   Mike
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter code using Mr. Ed, then save using Mr. Ed. Examine the file in
MS-DOS to see that it is not pure text as it should be.

 Starts with "WXME", right?
 
 When editing a file in MrEd, the default file-saving mode is MrEd's
 platform-independent multimedia format. This format handles text with
 styles, images, etc.
 
 You can make MrEd save a text file by selecting "Save as Text". When
 an existing text file is opened, or after a file is saved as text,
 MrEd will continue to save the file as text.
