>Description:
The code below produces this error:

send: target is not an object: #<undefined> for method: do-on-paint

but there is no do-on-paint method. The error trace points
to the super call.

    (define/override (on-paint)

        (let* ([dc (get-dc)]
               [old-pen (send dc get-pen)]
               [old-brush (send dc get-brush)])
          (send dc set-brush (send the-brush-list find-or-create-brush (get-panel-background) 'panel))
          (send dc set-pen (send the-pen-list find-or-create-pen "black" 1 'transparent))
          (send dc draw-rectangle 0 0 cw ch)
          (send dc set-pen old-pen)
          (send dc set-brush old-brush))))
    (super-on-paint)))
