>Description:
The Mac user interface made the unfortunate decision to have a single resize handle at the bottom right of the window. Some of us have an external monitor with more vertical resolution than our laptop screen. Unless one resizes the Dr Racket window to have a height less than the laptop height prior to disconnecting from the external monitor it appears to be impossible to get the window height to be less than the screen height. Clicking on the green zoom button or invoking the zoom command is supposed to make the window fit the screen. Unfortunately, in DrRacket this doesn't happen. Very frustrating if you don't notice this "feature" until you are a long way from any screen with sufficient vertical resolution to fix the problem. So right now, for me, this is a critical problem since I'm dead in the water. Even changing the preference to put the interactoins window next to the definitions window doesn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.On Mac laptop with an external monitor make a DrRacket window higher than the laptop's built-in screen.
2.Disconnect from the external monitor.
3.Try to resize the window. No luck!
Rebooting, restarting DrRacket, zoom button, option-click zoom button, menu zoom ...
None of these things fit the window to the screen.
Any one of them ought to fix the problem.

 Well I found a work around. So it isn't critical, even to me. But it 
 sure is annoying.

 For a short term fix, exit drracket, open up the preferences file
 ~/Library/Preferences/org.racket-lang.prefs.rktd and delete these two
 lines:
 
  (plt:framework-pref:drracket:unit-window-width 1287)
  (plt:framework-pref:drracket:unit-window-height 733)
 
 and then, hopefully, you'll be back in business. Worst comes to worst,
 you can remove that file (but you'll lose other prefs).
 
 In the meantime, we'll investigate a proper fix.
 
 Thanks for the report and sorry for the trouble!

 Somehow I was assigned the PR below without my notification (again).
 I've moved it over to the proper person, but it would have been good
 to have gotten an email about it.
 
 (Yes, there are parts of this that are mine, but only once I get some
 support at the racket/gui/base layer.)
