>Description:
The code below creates a canvas that gets painted black. The canvas is totally visible in the frame under X (KDE) but not under Windows. The frame must be manually resized under Windows to see the whole canvas.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define frame (instantiate frame% ("Turtle Canvas") (width 300) (height 300)))


(define black-brush 
  (instantiate brush% ((make-object color% "BLACK") 'solid)))

(define turtle-canvas
  (instantiate 
      (class canvas%
        (override on-paint)
        (define on-paint (lambda () (draw-rect)))
        (super-instantiate ()))
        (frame)))

(send frame show #t)

(define (draw-rect)
  (let ((dc (send turtle-canvas get-dc)))
    (send dc set-brush black-brush)
    (send dc draw-rectangle 0 0 300 300)))

 This isn't actually a bug. You need to use `get-client-size', a method
 of the canvas object.

 One other point: if you want the canvas to be 300x300, you can use the
 min-width and min-height methods, rather than setting the frame's size.
 In general, the frame size is pretty approximate, due to just this kind
 of thing (plus buttons and other controls are all different sizes
 everywhere).
 
 Hope that helps.
