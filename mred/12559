>Description:
Hi. I was trying to install a PLaneT package when all of a sudden my Internet connection stopped working.
Windows (in Brazilian Portuguese) gave a connection error message that could not be properly output.

See bellow:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PLaneT: downloading dyoo/porter-stemmer from planet.racket-lang.org via HTTP
PLaneT: PLaneT could not download the package "dyoo/porter-stemmer": tcp-connect: connection to planet.racket-lang.org, port 80 failed (at step 6: Uma tentativa de conex�o falhou porque o componente conectado n�o respondeu

corretamente ap�s um per�odo de tempo ou a conex�o estabelecida falhou

porque o host conectado n�o respondeu.; errno=10060)
Pango: couldn't load font "Lucida Grande Not-Rotated 10", falling back to "Sans Not-Rotated 10", expect ugly output.
Pango: couldn't load font "Lucida Grande Italic Not-Rotated 10", falling back to "Sans Italic Not-Rotated 10", expect ugly output.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The question marks should instead be things like "ã", "ó", etc...

That's a minor issue, but since Racket itself works well with international symbols, I thought it was worth reporting.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know. See the description.
The error comes from a string from Windows (maybe encoded as cp1252).
