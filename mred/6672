>Description:
as it appears that when a gui menu bar item is cliked on,
the previously inserted & selected gui box item itself
becomes de-selected prior to the the gui menu code being
able to determin which gui box/frame had been selected;
resuting in an error message requesting the selection of
a previously inserted gui box/frame prior to selecting a
gui menu bar action/item?

 Is this a bug about a program, or DrScheme's interface?
 
 Thanks,

 Sorry, the program; which enables the items selected within the
 optionally inserted GUI-menu-bar, to determine which previously
 inserted gui box frame within the editor window was selected as
 as target of it's requested action, seems to be broke; as I can:
 
 - show the gui-menu-bar.
 
 - insert a gui box into an editor frame.
 
 - select it, or a sub-frame/pane.
 
 - but when I then click on the gui-menu-bar item to insert a
   "button" for example into the previously selected gui-box-frame,
   the selected gui-box/frame becomes deselected simultaneously with
   the selection of the "button" item on the gui-menu-bar.
 
 - which then results in a message indicating that a gui-box/frame
   needs to be selected first (which it was prior to some portion
   of the DrScheme deselecting it when the menu-bar item was clicked).
 
 Which would guess is related to MrEd and/or the DrScheme FrameWork
 event UI event handling, which seems to automatically deselect the
 presently selected item within the editor frame, when another item
 within the same window frame/pane becomes selected?

 Maybe it is a UI issue, but assumed that the desired target of the
 gui-menu-bar action was selected by clicking on (which highlights)
 an element within the a previously inserted gui-box within the editor
 frame; as opposed to having to double clicking on it to bring up it's
 settings dialog window (which by the way ends up being hidden behind
 the main window when the gui-menu-bar item is clicked, and can't be
 easily brought back front because it's not in the window list)?
 
 So I guess in summary:
 
 - would be nicer/more-intuitive if the gui-menu-item target was
   considered to be the highlighted element within the inserted gui-box,
   without requiring that it's "settings dialog" window be opened.
 
 - and if its "setting's dialog" window is opened, it's added to the
   window list (actually it would be nice to have the framework automatically
   add all visible windows onto the window menu list as a default behavior).
 
 - (and finally, as a long term objective, which for whatever reason I like;
    would be nice to store and/or optionally display embedded graphic items
    within text as instantiated textual templates themselves, to allow them
    to be inspected and/or edited as text by the user and/or other programs
    for what ever reason, as opposed storing it's instantiation parameters in
    their present mixed binary form.)
 
 Sorry if I misunderstood what constituted "selection" of the gui-box element
 In the present implementation. Thanks again,

 Hi Paul --- sorry I've been slow to catch up on this one.
 
 You're completely right. The GUI toolbar doesn't work, because (as you
 suggest) clicking on the toolbar shifts the focus away from the editor
 that is the target of the toolbar operation.
 
 The real problem is that I got the GUI builder working in "proof of
 concept" mode nine months ago, and then dropped it completely. One day,
 either we'll find someone to work on it, or I'll run out of other
 things that I have to do myself.
 
 Matthew

 Although don't believe if I have the necessary familiarity with the core
 of wxWindow/DrScheme's event/UI framework to attempt to be of help much
 there;  however if that could be tweaked to enable the identification of
 embedded selected objects;  I could try in parallel to tweak the storage
 model used for embedded graphical elements, to enable them to be saved in
 a parameterized textual template format (which with a little luck could be
 structured in such a way that its evaluation would produce its embedded
 graphical representation equivalent).
 
 Assuming that the PLT team considers the notion of parameterized textual
 templates to be a potentially reasonable storage format alternative to the
 present mixed binary formatted file approach?

 As a minor tweak:
 
 ...(which with a little luck could be structured in such a way that
     its evaluation would produce its embedded graphical representation
     equivalent, or instantiate the corresponding structured source
     code necessary to produce that GUI element within a DrScheme based,
     or generated stand-alone application, at the users choice.)...
