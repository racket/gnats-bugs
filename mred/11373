>Description:
I see quite a lot of character-jumping up and down by 
a pixel in gracket2.  This may be related to my use of
the Consolas font; let me know if you can't reproduce
this. I'm also using side-by-side definitions/interactions
windows, but I'd be surprised if that were related.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a fresh editor window, type a left paren. Now type a
right paren. Oops! the left paren jumps up a bit 
(about a pixel?) when the
right paren is typed.  You can repeatedly delete and
re-type the right paren to see it jump up and down.

 This might be fixed, now. Can you check?
