>Description:
The filename argument of put-file
doesn't say if it expects the full
path of the filename or if it only
wants the last bit of the filename.

In the case when you supply the
full pathname under macos x, 
the file dialog beeps at you if you
click "save". This may be the right
behavior, but the docs should probably
clairify what kind of path is expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
(put-file "a" #f #f "/Users/robby/tmp.ss")
;; click `save' and hear a beep.

>Fix:
