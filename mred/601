>Description:
dialog boxes with buttons that are focused don't draw
the little frame around the button. Frames do, tho.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object wx:dialog-box% null "test" #f))
(define b (make-object wx:button% f null "test"))
(send f show #t)
(send b set-focus)
;; examine frame. No little border around the button
