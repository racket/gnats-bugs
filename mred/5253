>Description:
- vertical scroll bars for the content views are initially missdrawn,
after the window is re-sized, they apprear to be correct.

- the scrolling view does not dynamicly update while the scroll
bar is adjusted, as it does on other platforms.

>How-To-Repeat:
enter suffecient interactive input, and/or load a suffeciently
large defintion file, look at the scroll bar display, resize window,
attempt to dynamicly scroll the view.
