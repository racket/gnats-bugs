World programs do not run in their own event space, which causes
world programs to pause when interacting with DrRacket (e.g. selecting
a menu item).

Run this program, which counts up quickly,
then select a DrRacket menu and notice it
stops counting until the menu is de-selected.

 That's a `racket/gui' limitation on the Mac (and maybe other
 platforms): selecting a menu blocks all Racket threads.
