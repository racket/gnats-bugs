>Description:
drawing a spline into a post-script-dc% on the mac causes a crash (program text appears below).  When the draw-spline is commented out, everything works fine.  I was puzzled by the fact that there's no DrawSpline routine in the file wb_ps.cc. Actually, it looks like it loads spline-drawing code for windows and X, but I can't see where the mac implementation comes from.  So I set a breakpoint in wb_dc in the DrawSpline routine, but execution never reached that point.  Hm.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define my-dc (make-object post-script-dc%))

(send my-dc start-doc "this is a descriptive string")
(send my-dc start-page)
(send my-dc draw-spline 0 0 150 15 0 150)

(send my-dc end-page)
(send my-dc end-doc)
