>Description:
Often, methods that calculate layout information about
a snip or an editor return bogus information before
the snip or editor is viewed. So, a method that informs
the editor/snip when it is viewed is useful. Currently,
such a thing can be implemented in scheme, but it requires
deriving new classes from each of snip, editor and editor-canvas
and if any basic mred class is used instead of those derived
classes the information can be lost. Often, in the past,
when this is required to implement something (say, the container
classes) it is pushed into the basic classes that mred provides.
I would like to see that happen to some variant of an on-viewed
method.

 I don't know how you're implementing this in Scheme. Aren't the
 calculations invalid if you print?
 
 Thanks,

 I'm not sure how that would work for printing. Presumably it would use
 the wrong numbers. So, I guess that this would have to be built in. Do
 you plan to add something like that? I don't know if "viewed" is the
 right term; to be sure, I mean hat I would like a callback that is
 invoked saying "okay, you can calculate layout information in terms of
 snip sizes and positions now".

An on-viewed method wouldn't fit into the editor framework. Better to
calculate on demand within get-extent, paying attention to
size-cache-invalid calls.
