>Description:

When resizing a window, no other thread gets any time.

>How-To-Repeat:

(send (make-object wx:frame% null "test" 100 100 100 100) show #t)
(thread (lambda () (let f ([x 0]) (display x) (newline) (sleep 1/10) (f (+ x 1)))))

resize the frame and the printouts stop.

State-Changed-Why:
This will probably never change. [Note the more serious bug that
primitive dialogs (such as the find file dialog) also block
threads. This is in OPENBUGS.]
