>Description:
I installed 5.1 and have attempted to use the DrRacket IDE. The IDE is unresponsive, and causes full processor use when GUI elements are used, including scrolling, typing, and selection of text.

Running Ubuntu 10.10.
>How-To-Repeat:
compile and install using ./configure; make; make install;
add racket-5.1/bin to $PATH
launch drracket and interact with GUI elements - typing code, scrolling text, any of the buttons or menus.
>Fix:
