MS Windows 98
>Description:
drscheme crashed repeatedly when i used play-sound 
to play a sound file. the sound file can be played 
using a multi-media file.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. place sound file s in a directory x
2. place this code into definitions window: 

   (current-directory x)
   (file-exists? s)
   (play-sound s #t)

3. in some cases, this produces #t and #f in the interactions window. 
   in others, it crashes drscheme. no pattern discernible.

 Thank you very much for your problem report.
 It has the internal identification `all/2111'.

 Under Win2000, the same file ("it.wav") produces no sound.  Other sound
 files do produce sound.
