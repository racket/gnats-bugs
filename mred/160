State-Changed-Why:

Unfortunately, the choice is between getting this right and having
eventspaces that work. I have chosen eventspaces.

The reason this cannot work is that I have to use the low-level OS
queue to implement eventspaces. Otherwise, the interleaving of mouse
and keyboard events in one eventspace does not work with the
execution of update and activate events in another. A more clever
hacker may find a way to do it with GetNxtEvent, but I am stuck
and have given up.
