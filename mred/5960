>Description:
The severity of the problem is non-critical, but very annoying. I run a Dell Inspiron 8100, 256MB RAM, 30GB HD, PIII 1.2 GHz CPU, 1600x1200 display under X Windows (using Gentoo 1.2 linux distro). The text which appears in Dr Scheme as I type it in, appears delayed. If I type moderately quickly, the text doesn't appear AS I type, but it lags, and appears much more slowly. My CPU % usage (as reported by gkrellm) also shoots up to 99% while I'm typing. It's like my CPU can't catch up with how fast I'm typing (and I'm not typing gibberish; I'm typing actual code).

I don't have this problem in any other text editor. In Dr Scheme, I have tried other fonts, other font sizes. I can fix the problem by using adobe-courier font at size 12 and making my Dr Scheme window about the size of 1/3 of my screen.

I have also had this problem with Dr Scheme 202; I am right now trying 201 again because I did not remember having the problem with 201. I have discovered, however, that I have problems with both versions.
>How-To-Repeat:
I haven't been able to reproduce this on anyone else's machine. It happens to me when I increase Dr Scheme nearly to 1600x1200, and the font size (for adobe-courier) to 14.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 00:31:55 -0500
Reason: Replying.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 00:31:55 -0500
Reason: Probably irrelevant now.  From the description it sounds 
like this was a problem of rendering a specific font on a 
specific resolution.
