>Description:
Hey all --
My xserver (hygiea.cs.rice.edu, an NCD) has 8Meg of RAM.
Most applications seem to run fine, and the main drscheme window
comes up no problem.
But if I try creating new windows in drscheme, drscheme crashes:

X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Serial number of failed request:  18220
  Current serial number in output stream:  18221

Other applications work fine -- for instance, I can start up several
new netscape windows no prob.
This happens for "Select Library", "Insert Image", "Open", "Save",
"Print Definitions".
However, "Configure Language" works fine (!).

This happens both when running drscheme on titan and on verm
(displaying to my NCD).

>How-To-Repeat:
Start drscheme, then choose any of
"Select Library", "Insert Image", "Open", "Save", "Print Definitions".

The main bug is fixed. When allocating bitmaps, NCDs roun out of
memory quickly, but this is not so much a bug as GC inefficiency.
