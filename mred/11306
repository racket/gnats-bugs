>Description:
Opening any file dialog box immediately pegs the CPU at 100%, and keeps it at 100% until DrRacket is closed.

It's the dialog itself, apparently. Opening a recent file or saving with CTRL-S doesn't cause the problem. Every way of opening the file dialog I've tried causes the problem, however.

Funny enough, DrRacket remains responsive, though the CPU is pegged and the garbage collector runs about once every second.
>How-To-Repeat:
Click on "Open ..." or "Save Definitions As ..." in the File menu.
