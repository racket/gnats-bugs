>Description:
In PLT Scheme version 4, all mred windows had the X11 WM_CLASS property of "mred". In Racket 5.0*, they had WM_CLASS of "gracket". In 5.1 and higher, presumably with the new GUI toolkit, they have class "<unknown>". This is unfortunate, because one can no longer tell one's window manager to, say, put all Racket windows on desktop 3
>How-To-Repeat:
Run "xprop" and click on a DrRacket window
