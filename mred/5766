>Description:
I've observed that sending `show #f' to a MrEd frame or dialog object when 
it is the last visible frame/dialog object or when there are no visible
frame/dialog objects causes the program to terminate even if there are 
other threads running.

I'm not certain whether this is the desired behavior.  It seems
inconsistent to me, though, since a frame or dialog object can be hidden
without the program terminating when there are other visible frame/dialog
objects.
>How-To-Repeat:
;;
;; Notice that `foo' will be printed until the frame is sent `show #f'.
;; At that point, the program will terminate even though the thread 
;; printing `foo' is still running.
;;

(thread
 (lambda ()
   (let print-foo ()
     (display "foo\n")
     (sleep 1)
     (print-foo))))


(let ((frame (make-object frame% "" #f 500 250)))
  (sleep 5)
  (send frame show #f))

 That is indeed the intended behavior. More precisely, MrEd terminates
 when the main thread isn't running, when there are no visible top-level
 windows, and when there are no queued events or running timers.
 
 Why? It tends to do what people expect when they haven't given the
 problem much thought.
 
 For those who give it thought, the best thing is to put
   (yield (make-semaphore 0))
 at the end of the program, and then explicitly call `exit' to exit.
