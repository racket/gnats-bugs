 Are you trying to run the pre-compiled version of the Linux binaies, as
 distributed from our web site?
 
 If so, the problem is a library incomatibility, and you need to compile
 your own binary. The source code is available from the download page
 (there's a "unix source code" option in the pop-up list of platforms).
 Compiling for Linux is straightforward, but let us know if you have any
 problems compiling.
