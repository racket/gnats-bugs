State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 11 13:50:26 1997
State-Changed-Why:

user-min-width doesn't determine the actual minimum width. That is
determined by the initial zie of an item. If user-min-width is
supposed to be min-width, please submit a new bug report; otherwise,
user-min-width is fine.

The original context for this bug report was from Sperber, RE:
mred:text% sizing under Xt. The initial size (which is the minimum
size) didn't use the size of the input string (it was just a
constant). This has been fixed.

Fixed but not yet released.

 user-min-width is supposed to only take effect if the item's natural
 minimum width is smaller than user-min-width's argument I believe, so
 user-min-width can make items take upmore space in a window.
