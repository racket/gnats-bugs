>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce:
 
   - execute the code below (or mred -qr .. works)
   - click a few times to set the focus to the
     text and set the cursor on the middle line
   - type space
 
At this point, the blue will be covering the letters in
lines 1 and 3. Perhaps the clipping region isn't set?
 
Without the edit sequence in the call to on-change,
the bug doesn't show up.

 This has to do with the editor being locked-for-flow during
 `on-change'.
 
 The `end-edit-sequence' in `on-change' triggers a multi-line update to
 the pasteboard, but since the `on-change' editor is locked-for-flow, it
 is unresponsive to the update. After `on-change' returns, the
 `on-change' editor requests a single-line update, only.
 
 It's probably surprising that `end-edit-sequence' triggers an update
 even if you comment out move-to. This update is because the `on-change'
 text had previously sent a `resized' notification to the pasteboard,
 but it requested a delayed refresh. This delay gets forced by
 `end-edit-sequence'.
 
 I improved things in a couple of ways. First, an update triggered
 during locked-for-flow is not entirely lost, but instead recorded for
 later. Second, pasteboard's `end-edit-sequence' refrains from forcing a
 delayed update (on the assumption that the requestor will make another
 request).
 
 I guess the blame in this case goes to the `on-change' method, which is
 doing things that need flowing.
