 The problem is that you don't have the mred documentation installed in your
 plt distribution. (and there is no way in html to express "if this link
 doesn't work, go to this other one")
 
 It doesn't seem feasible to include the documentation for the toolbox in
 the release, since it takes up about 7 megabytes when compressed. 
 
 What do you reccommend?

 It shouldn't be a bug. A graceful warning 
 
 	"The documentation is not available on your machine. Should I
  	 attempt to use the Web and fetch the information from Rice?" 
 
 would be enough. -- Matthias

 I could do that, but it would be strange for other html stuff. But, since
 we don't really use mred's html viewer for anything else I think that I can
 hack something reasonable in -- I hadn't thought of that. (I can even check
 to see if the link is a file: link in the documentation directory and then
 redirecthat to our documentation homepage.)

 It's obvious for other uses, too. You use a default exception handler to
 display the usual: 
 
 	"URL not found"
 
 message.

 There are links from our documentation pages to the entire rest of the web!
 
 But, I think that I can figure something out.
