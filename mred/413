>Description:
I am using Dr. Scheme on my Macintosh 6290CD, which runs MacOS 7.5.5.  Every time I try to print the Scheme definitions, I get a system error, forcing me to restart the computer.  The dialogue box says:

Sorry, a system error occurred
"MrEd PPC"
	error type 11

...along with a "restart" button.

>How-To-Repeat:
Open up Dr. Scheme, and attempt to print the definitions of a program.

State-Changed-Why:

I was never able to reproduce this problem. I did make several
improvements for printing in 51 (released a few weeks agao),
though. Does printing in 51 still crash?
