>Description:
This is an attempt to reproduce a problem I found in a larger context.
This code doesn't exhibit the same behaviour I was looking for; in
the larger context, all mred windows stop responding. In this snippet,
only the dialog stops responding, but perhaps this is related.

To demonstrate, put the following code in a file and startup mred with
the -f flag pointing to that file. There will be a frame that responds
to know events open. It should not be there.

(define custodian (make-custodian))
(parameterize ([current-custodian custodian])
  (parameterize ([current-eventspace (make-eventspace)])
    (queue-callback
     (lambda ()
       (queue-callback
	(lambda () (custodian-shutdown-all custodian)))
       (message-box "test" "Test")))))

 By inspecting the code, I see that killing an eventspace generally
 doesn't close dialogs in the eventspace under Windows. X and MacOS
 don't have the prioblem.
 
 I remember this bug. I fixed it under X months ago. When I went to fix
 it under Windows, I got sidetracked by a much harder problem, and
 forgot to fix the original bug (or add a test suite entry).
 
 I've committed and exp-tagged a fix.
