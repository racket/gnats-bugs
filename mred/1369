 I could use some more information, but I have a feeling I know what's 
 going on here.  Can you print anything at all from DrScheme? I'm 
 guessing you can't.
 
 I believe the problem here is that DrScheme calls the OS 
 synchronously, and when things go awry (Print Dialog needs extra 
 information, printing system not up for whatever reason) this call 
 never returns.
 
 The next time this happens to you, try printing from some other 
 application, and see whether there are extra dialogs that you have to 
 go through.
 
 thanks,
