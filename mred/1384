>Description:
When a popupmenu has a disabled item and the right button
is clicked on the disabled item, the callback that is
passed to the popupmenu is called, even though the menu
is still around.

Also, if on-event is called in canvas for a right-button
click and that triggers a popup menu, when the right
button is released (even if the menu is still around)
the popup menu's callback is called.

 I can't reproduce the problem in my test suite.
 
 I see that the "(define ...)" popup in DrScheme under Windows get
 unhilited via right-button clicks, but it doesn't appear to be due to
 the popup-menu callback. Instead, it seems to be due to the handling of
 mouse-up events in the canvas. Commenting out lines 603-605 of
 drscheme/unit.ss eliminates the symptom.
