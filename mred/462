>Description:
	M-C-u (move to outside the current S-expression) is confused
by expressions like ( 1 2 3) where whitespace appears after the open paren
and before the first contained S-expression. Parenthesis-correction
(e.g., automatically changing ']' to ')' to match parens) is similarly
confused, probably for the same reason.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Type "( 1 )", move the caret to just before "1" and type
M-C-u. (Do this in Scheme mode.)
