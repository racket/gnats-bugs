 Sorry about the missing info in the bug report (and likely a duplicate), =
 tried to use the <enter> in the text edit to format and it submitted the =
 unfinished bug report.
 
 The problem is that the gui response time becomes very slow.
 
 Using the following definitions to reproduce
 
 #lang racket
 
 (require 2htdp/image)
 
 (define (carpet size c)
  (if (<=3D size 2)
      (square size "outline" c)
      (local [(define sub (carpet (/ size 3) c))
              (define ctr (square (/ size 3) "solid" "white"))]
        (overlay (square size "outline" c)
                 (above (beside sub sub sub)
                        (beside sub ctr sub)
                        (beside sub sub sub))))))
 
 (carpet 200 "red")
 
 Running the last form in the interactions seems to be worse, but problem =
 exists if these definitions are run directly.
