>Description:

I just installed Dr. Scheme and have been very excited by
its interface for use in our courses here.  It seems to work
perfectly fine, EXCEPT when I try to print either the
interaction buffer or the source buffer.  In either case
it starts accessing the hard drive of the machine, an error
message (see below) appears on the screen, and after a minute
or so it segmentation faults and dumps a core.

Here's the error message it reports:

Pid 19821 received a SIGSEGV for stack growth failure.
Possible causes: insufficient memory or swap space,
or stack size exceeded maxssiz.

It only does this when printing, not when running deeply
nested recursions, so far as I have been able to determine.

>How-To-Repeat:

Run drscheme on an HP/UX machine.  Select Print at any
time.

 Thanks for the PR. One question: when you print, do you check "Send to
 Printer", "Print To File", or "Preview Only"? The default it "Preview
 Only" (although I think we should change the default to "Send to
 Printer").
 
 If you had used "Preview Only", could you verify that the same crash
 occurs for "Print to File"?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

State-Changed-Why:

This bug cannot be completely fixed before the 53 release.  I did make
it work a little better, though. You should at least be able to print
to your default printer, or to preview and print/save via ghostview.
DO NOT try to print to a file; the file dialog used by the print
dialog is broken, and I can't hack around the problem like I did
for the print dialog.

In case you're particularly interested, the problem appears to be some
strangeness in the HP/UX Athena Widget library, specifically the text
widget. I don't know whether the widget is bad in HP/UX's library, or
whether DrScheme is mis-using the widget in a way that doesn't matter
on other platforms. In any case, we are already planning to stop using
this widget in version 54, so the problem will be solved completely
with the next release.
