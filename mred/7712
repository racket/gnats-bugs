>Description:
My students have experienced this intermittent problem when running version 209 on Windows machines.  If they create a file containing a comment box or some other non-text, when they save the file it somehow gets encoded wrong and becomes unopenable by DrScheme or any other program.  This is, of course, frustrating to them as they lose any work in the file.  In some cases students reported that saving the file caused DrScheme to crash, but I have not witnessed this myself.  I have seen several of the corrupted files: DrScheme gives an error message about an unknown code when I've tried to open them.

We have not experienced this problem with either Mac or Linux versions.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file (under Windows, DrScheme vers. 209) that contains one or more comment boxes.

Save the file, Quit DrScheme, and then try to open the file again.
(As I said above, I believe this is an intermittent problem, so it may not happen every time.)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Mon, 28 Nov 2005 21:28:07 -0500
Reason>>> Replying

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 28 Nov 2005 21:28:07 -0500
Reason>>> There have been many similar reports for version 299.  It's
likely that the corrupt files are a result of some students 
using it.  (both 299.200 and 299.400 had problems).

The new version (checked in, and soon to become version 
300) should not suffer from these problems at all.  I am 
closing this bug report, assuming it does not happen; it 
would be nice if you can verify that the problems do not 
happen on the new version -- you can get a build from 
pre.plt-scheme.org.
