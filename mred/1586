A text range selection misbehaves when the focus is lost once.
I have seen this in both Linux and Windows.

Start MrEd
press <up> <S-right> <S-right>
switch to some other window, then switch back
press <S-right> <S-right> -- normal behaviour
press <S-left> <S-left> <S-left>
the last key will show the problem.
