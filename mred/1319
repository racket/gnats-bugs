Hi

After installing Dr-Scheme-101 to the Unix workstations, there are a variety of
problems showing up.  Some of the Unix workstations are able to launch 
drscheme, drscheme-jr.  However, some cannot. The error spotted was:
/opt/drscheme-101/plt/bin/drscheme-jr[11]: /applications/drscheme-101/plt/.bin/parisc-hpux/mzscheme: 
Execute permission denied.

The files indicated above are all readable and executable: chmod 755

Please tell me what the problem is.  I need to fix this bug so that students
can have the software to do their lab.

Thanks.

Steven

 If you look at the drscheme-jr script you mention above, you'll see
 that it also invokes PLTHOME/bin/archsys.  Does archsys have the
 proper permissions on all machines?

 archsys has the proper permission settings.
 
 The weirdess part is that since I installed drscheme on a server and ran
 a script to install it on all of our HP Unix workstations.  The problem
 with it is that a certain type of workstation (C110) does not work with
 drscheme. The C3000s and C240s all work fine.

 Does the C110 use a different OS than the others?  Are all the machines 
 running DrScheme from the same disk?

 They're all running hpux10.20 from the same disk.

 I'm told that Matthew Flatt is going to look into this 
 problem directly on your HP machines.  I'm closing this 
 bug report, and Matthew will handle bug report 1321,
 filed by John Allen.  That report mentions essentially the 
 same bug on your machines.
