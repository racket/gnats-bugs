>Description:
here's a wierd one. 

 if you try to exit drscheme 207 for windows by keystroke
 while working on something that "needs to be saved", 
 only you don't want to save it, 
 when you get the dialog box saying "Warning! the file
 Untitled has not been saved. do you want to
 save-button cancel-button close-anyway-button?",
 you have to either click on the "close anyway" button,
 or RIGHT-RIGHT-SPACE.
 
 if you RIGHT-RIGHT-ENTER, it pops up the "save as" dialog.

 wierd...
>How-To-Repeat:
open drscheme v207 for windows.
move to the definitions window
type "blah, enter, blah, enter, blah"
type alt-F4 to exit the the application.
type RIGHT-RIGHT to move focus to the "close anyway" button.

if you type SPACEBAR it'll exit fine, but if you type ENTER
 it pops up a "save as" dialog (like one would expect if
 one was attemtping to trigger the "save" event).

 I've tried that, and compared it to the behavior of standard windows
 applications.  The problem is that when the arrows are used to move
 between the buttons, the focus does change (so hitting space works),
 but when enter is used, the default button is always used, and that
 does not change together with the focus.
 
 The difference between them is subtle so it is usually missed, just
 try to move the focus and you'll see that the dark border is still
 around the save button.  Since other applications do move both the
 focus and default, enter works just like space.
 
 (All of this applies to Unix too -- both drscheme's behavior and the
 way normal (Linux) applications behave.  Doesn't apply to OSX where
 apparently there is no way to use the keyboard to navigate the
 buttons.)
 
 So I think that it'll be better to make the default button change when
 the keyboard is used to change the focus.  Probably a MrEd issue.

 Mac OS X does have this, but it isn't enabled by default. (Matthew
 recently added support for it, but I forget how to enable it)

 Yes, I think so too.

 In Mac OS X, moving the keyboard focus does not change the button hit
 by Return, only the button hit by Space. This is obviously the right
 thing to do. :)
 
 As Eli notes, Windows and Unix GUI toolboxes generally make the
 distinction graphically between the Return and Space buttons, but
 practically all applications move the Return "focus" along with the
 Space focus.
 
 The latter behavior is clearly what people expect under Windows and
 Unix. Further normalizing MrEd's focus-moving behavior is on my list of
 things to do.
