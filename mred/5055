>Description:
In message boxes, there's a popup on the text-box to allow you
to copy the message.  Unfortunately, it's in effect for clicks in
the scroll bar, too, if the message is long enough to have one.
This prevents you from using the scroll bar to read the rest of
the message.
>How-To-Repeat:
(message-box "title" "really





long










message-box.")

Now try to scroll.
