 Windows defines a `file extension' to be an extension registered with
 the system. Suppose you double-click on an "ss" file and select a
 program to open it. In response, Windows makes "ss" an extension,
 mapping it to the program you picked. Afterwards, running the above
 example would produce "tmp.ss" rather than "tmp.ss.scm".
 
 One exception to this rule: Windows assumes that the default extension
 you provide is an extenion. So even if "scm" is not mapped, typing
 "x.scm" would return "x.scm" rather than "x.scm.scm" (when "scm" is
 specified as the default extension).
 
 I didn't know any of this before experienting with Windows just now.
 
 The PLT installer maps "ss" and "scm" to DrScheme, so our users would
 have no trouble using "ss" as an extension.
 
 As far as I can tell, there's no way to "fix" the Windows file dialog
 so it treats anything after a dot as an extension. MrEd can't just add
 the extension itself. The Windows dialog has to know about the default
 extension so it can present the "File already exists - overwrite?"
 warning.
 
 We have two options:
 
  * leave things alone, or
 
  * drop the "scm" default and require users to type the extension.
 
 I'm inclined to leave things alone, because it more closely follows
 the convention that Windows dictates.

 This is slightly confusing at first, but once you get used to it it's
 no big deal.  I think this is the behaviour Windows users expect (I
 have certainly come to do so).  If that's so, changing it would be a
 bad idea.  I agree with you that it's best left alone.
