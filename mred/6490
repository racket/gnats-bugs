>Description:
In the past few weeks, the DrScheme installation (205) on my home
machine (G4 iMac, 512MB RAM, Mac OS 10.2.6, now 10.2.8) has had no
button bar.  Some of the commands on the button bar are still
accessible from the Scheme menu, but for others (e.g. the Stepper)
I see no way to invoke the functionality.  Did I accidentally turn
off the button bar somehow, and if so, how do I turn it back on?
Do I need to reinstall DrScheme?
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know how or precisely when it happened.  Restarting DrScheme,
and for that matter rebooting the computer, doesn't fix it.

 There is a wide button in the top right of your drscheme window. Click
 it.
 
 When iconify a window (and maybe in other situations) that button is
 implicitly pressed. This is a bug... it's fixed in our CVS versions,
 but not in time for v205.
 
 Sorry for the trouble.
