>Description:
The documentation clearly states that each snip's copy method is
responsible for copying the style to the new snip. The built-in
editor-snip class did not copy the style to the new snip.

This is the fixed Copy method from wx_msnip.cxx 
(includes an earlier pr's fix as well):

wxSnip *wxMediaSnip::Copy(void)
{
  wxMediaSnip *ms;
  wxMediaBuffer *mb;

  mb = (me ? me->CopySelf() : (wxMediaBuffer *)NULL);
  ms = wxsMakeMediaSnip(mb, 
			withBorder,
			leftMargin, topMargin,
			rightMargin, bottomMargin,
			leftInset, topInset,
			rightInset, bottomInset,
			minWidth, maxWidth,
			minHeight, maxHeight);

  if (!me)
    ms->SetMedia(NULL);

  ms->tightFit = tightFit;  // Robby
  ms->SetStyle(style);      // Robby

  return ms;
}

I did not check in this change.

 Thanks. I replaced
 
   ms->SetStyle(style);      // Robby
 
 with
 
   wxSnip::Copy(ms);
 
 which has the same effect for now, but wxSnip::Copy() may be extended
 in the future.
