>Description:
On windows vista with a laptop with an american standard keyboard I cannot define keybindings that use two control characters.

(keybinding "c:s:a" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "Ā"))) produces A not Ā
and
(keybinding "c:m:r" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "ṝ")))
produces nothing.
>How-To-Repeat:
On Windows (I'm using Vista) define keybindings as follows:
#lang s-exp framework/keybinding-lang
(keybinding "c:a" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "ā")))
Create a user defined keybindings file as follows:

(keybinding "c:i" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "ī")))
(keybinding "c:u" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "ū")))
(keybinding "m:t" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "ṭ")))
(keybinding "c:s:a" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "Ā")))
(keybinding "c:m:r" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "ṝ")))

The single control character keybindingss work but the double control character keybindings don't.

 There has not been any progress, I'm sorry report.
 
 I see the bug under windows 7 as well (also: standard american keyboard).
 
 Here's a fragment of code that demonstrates the problem without using
 DrRacket (typing control-a works, control-shift-a doesn't).
 
 Robby
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label ""] [width 200] [height 200]))
 (define t (new text%))
 (define ec (new editor-canvas% [parent f] [editor t]))
 (send ec focus)
 
 (define k (new keymap%))
 (send t set-keymap k)
 
 (send k add-function "1" (λ (x y) (send x insert "1")))
 (send k map-function "c:a" "1")
 (send k map-function "c:s:a" "1")
 
 (send f show #t)

 Since this doesn't use the framework, I'm reassigning to gracket/mflatt.
