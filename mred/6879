>Description:
Hi all.  I have a brand-new month-old laptop with fully patched Windows XP Home.  I've tried installing v207, then v206, then v200 with the same problem - during the install, the files and tree get copied over, and then it kicks off the MrEd portion, at which point I get a GPF saying that mred.exe has caused an error and must close.  The only version of DrScheme I've gotten to work is v103p1.  Ideas?
>How-To-Repeat:
Download v207 for Windows
Install
Select default options
Wait until crash at mred.exe portion of install.

 Problem appears to have been solved by running "finish install.exe". 
 
 You really need to add the bug searching function to your web site.  I 
 only found this fix after I had submitted my support request (#6879), 
 because then I was given a screen where I could make a query for other 
 support requests for "mred", at which point I found the solution as the 
 very last of 406 entries, namely #6878, which is the last presentation 
 before mine...

 Hi,
 
 It's possible that we've found the source of the problem, but we don't
 yet know. Perhaps you could help us run a test:
 
  Try, once again, to install version 207. After it crashes, replace the
  "libmred207_000.dll" in your system folder with
 
     http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/tmp/libmred207_000.dll
 
  Then go to the PLT folder and double-click "Finish Install.exe".
 
 We expect Finish Install to either crash immediately or succeed. Please
 let us know either way, if you have time to try this.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Hi!  I guess y'all didn't see my email from yesterday.  Running "Finish 
 Install.exe" on its own worked just fine, so me thinks it's just kicking 
 off during the install while certain files are open that need to be 
 closed...

 Ah - that's too bad, at least from the perspective of finding the bug.
 
 For some people, running Finish Install directly doesn't work either,
 so we're pretty sure there's a MrEd bug. It seems to be depend on how
 fast certain things happen. Running Finish Install sometimes changes
 the timing just enough, and sometimes doesn't.
 
 Thanks for the quick reply,
 Matthew
