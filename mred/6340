>Description:
I receive an Out of Memory error while running the "Setup PLT" program after a clean installation. MrEd launches, displays an output window, and gets to the step "compiling .zos used by Framework private" before throwing the error. I have 128MB of which approximately 30MB are used by the OS itself and I am running no other programs during the installation.
