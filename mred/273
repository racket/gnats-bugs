>Description:
If you use break button to kill the evaluation thread while a read
 is in progress, and then start a new thread (w/ execute) and
 again do read (see reproduction steps) then no snip appears for the
 read to read from, and as far as I can tell, there is no way to get
 the input into the read so as to continue normally -- all you can do
 is break out of the read (which this time doesn't go through the
 more involved process of the first break -- it just immediately
 displays "user break" and the prompt, like breaking out of a normal
 procedure).

>How-To-Repeat:
execute drscheme
in interaction window, type (read) and return
once snip appears for read, press break button
press break button again
in "Do you want to kill the evaluation?" dialog, press kill button
in "The evaluation thread is no longer running ..." dialog press ok button
press execute button
in interaction window, type (read) and return

breaking is now enabled during reads. So, killing should not be necessary
anymore.
