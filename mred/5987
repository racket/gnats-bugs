>Description:
when the cursor is placed over one of the
window buttons (like execute for example)
prior to attempting to select an app menu
item, the initial click appears to be ignored
until after the cursor is subsequently moved,
which appears to indicate that the
click event is being initially ignored for some
reason, which may be related to why the
the button state (i.e. greyed out, etc)
tracking apears to sometimes get lost
when interacting with analyize.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Mon, 27 Nov 2006 07:50:06 -0500
Reason>>> I may have finally made some progress on the very old
problem with menu selection. In the latest SVN version of
MrEd, when a mouse-down event is received, MrEd avoids
checking for further events until the event is considered
sufficiently handled. In the case of menu-bar clicks, the
event is not identified as handled until controls gets all the
way to the MenuSelect() toolbox call. This avoids dequeueing
events that should got to MenuSelect() instead of MrEd's parallel
queue.

It's still possible for an event to get dequeued too early.
For example, if there's a `yield' somewhere, then maybe
further MrEd events must be handled to avoid deadlock. But
I'm optimistic that this change will make dropped events rare
instead of (on my machine) very common.

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:35:53 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
