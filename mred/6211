 Do you see the non-debugging slowdown in MzScheme, too, or just
 DrScheme?
 
 (I don't see the non-debugging slowdown at all, so far, but maybe I'm
 not testing on the right machine or with the right ocnfiguration.)

 I don't get any slowdowns anywhere....

 There is a variable I didn't mention, just before re-compiling (with
 make clean) the latest 203.7 exp version, I updated to OSX 10.2.5.
 
 (which I didn't mention, as I didn't think it could be the root cause)
 
 And to your question, yes I saw what appeared to be a uniform slowdown
 both with and without the debug language option enabled?
 
 (I use a 600MHz ibook; the only other thing that comes to mind is that
  I wonder if the latest code version grew just enough to thrash the cache,
  on my machine which is a relatively small 256K by today's standards; but
  given the relative simplicity of my little benchmark, I wouldn't have
  thought it was the problem, but I guess it's possible?)
 
 (or wonder if any of the libraries that Dr/MzScheme link to slowed down
  with 10.2.5, but it seems like a pretty big slowdown, which if affected
  most user programs, would guess lots of folks would get on Apples case.)
 
 Given that you see no slowdown, for no-debug or w/debug vs the most recent
 earlier release (i.e. 203.6), then it would appear to be an idiosyncrasy
 with my machine/environment, I guess.
 
 Thanks for your quick response, at the moment, it would seem the only thing
 you could try, would be to update to 10.2.5, to see if that was the problem?
 
 Thanks again, -paul-

 sorry, I missed the point of your main question, I've never tried the
  benchmark with a naked MzScheme, so have no historical data, but latest
  data is:
 
 within MzScheme (via terminal) ~4.7 sec, vs DrScheme no-debug ~4.8 sec.
 
 previously within DrScheme no-debug ~3.3 sec.
 
 So if you see no difference between 203.6 vs 203.7, it's apparently my
 Machine/osx10.2.5, that's affecting MzScheme's performance somehow?

 I don't know. I also upgraded to 10.2.5 today, but I don't know the
 runtime of your benchmark on my machine before the upgrade.
 
 I've only compared v203 to v203.7 on my current configuration, and they
 run the same for me (without debugging).

 The ~40% slowdown appears to be related to OSX 10.2.5, as I've just
 downloaded the 203 distribution, and benchmarked it; no-debug is about
 the same as 203.7 (i.e. 40% slower), but with-debug is faster (but due
 to the absents of the new frame bindings display feature added in 203.6/7).
 
 So, somehow Mz/DrScheme running on OSX 10.2.4 is much slower, but does not
 seem to be affecting my other apps noticeably? (my only guess is that OSX's
 newest installed libraries may be handling event compatibility differently,
 and somehow stealing time from MzScheme? does that make any sense? What do
 the times displayed by "(time ...)" actually measure, could these have been
 affected? (lastly, it may be my imagination, but the menu's seem sluggish,
 but that may be due the the bug that requires the mouse to often be moved,
 prior to the app recognizing that there was a press-down on one of the menu
 selections; but of course that wouldn't likely explain it as MzScheme is
 about the same speed, which implies it has to do the MzScheme, not DrScheme,
 could it possibly the "time" procedure calls, used by "(time ...)", or some
 interaction with the garbage collector and the OS ?
 
 Thanks again, -paul-

 Just updated & recompiled (wxscheme.cxx updated), every thing
 is now as fast as it was. Out of curiosity, what was the issue?

 Even mzscheme (in terminal) has sped back up.
 
 (even without updates to the mzscheme library source code?)

 I'm embarrassed to say I've discovered the "performance problem":
 
 When the OS was updated, it changed my processor performance to "Reduced"
 when running on batteries; this morning when it was plugged in, and I saw
 no performance degradation (sorry, but it didn't occur to me to check the
 setting until I unplugged it, and noticed the performance went to hell
 again.)
 
 Needless to say, very sorry for the wild goose chase, -paul-

 Aha! I'm glad that the mystery is solved.
