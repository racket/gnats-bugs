>Description:
For the MrEd graphical objects, the position of the labels is
not specified in the documentation.  E.g.,

For choice%, it is to the left of the pull-down list.
For text-field%, it is to the left of the field.
For button%, it is in the button.
For check-box%, it is to the right of the box.  (NOTE: This seems inconsistent.)

State-Changed-Why:

This information is, in principle, platform-specific.  Whenever the
location of the label is important (and not necessarily the same as
the convention normally chosen by a platform), use explicit message%
objects.
