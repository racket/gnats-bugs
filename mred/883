 At this point, the minimum width is fixed. (The choice% documentation
 should make that clear, although the fact is still documented via the
 container docs, which insist that minimum graphical sizes for controls
 are determined at creation time.)

 Silly me. Yes I did. It used to (under 53). Either that, or it was
 defaultly stretchable.
