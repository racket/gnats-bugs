In Windows:
  mred file
only opens the correct file for editing if the command
is executed in the directory specified by HOMEDRIVE and 
HOMEPATH. (If `file' is a complete pathname, it works fine.)

But typing `(current-directory)' in the REP
immediately after MrEd starts gives me the working
directory where mred was started, not the directory 
specified by HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH. (It's not clear
whether this is good or bad, but it's probably useful
data for fixing the file-opening problem.)

State-Changed-Why:

When a new eventspace is created, it gets the initial directory from the
original directory when mred was started, even though that value is not
available anywhere else in the program. Install this as
plt/collects/tmp/system.ss:

(printf "orig ~a~n" (current-directory))
(current-directory "/tmp")
(printf "set to ~a~n" (current-directory))
(define t (current-thread))
(parameterize ([wx:current-eventspace (wx:make-eventspace)])
  (let* ([f (make-object wx:frame% null "" 100 100 100 100)]
	 [p (make-object wx:panel% f)]
	 [b (make-object wx:button% p
			 (lambda x
			   (printf "dir now~a~n" 
				   (eq? t (current-thread))
				   (current-directory)))
			 "button")])
    (send f show #t)))

(define (mred:initialize . x)
  (thread (lambda ()
	    (read-eval-print-loop)
	    (exit))))


and run "mred -s tmp" (be sure not to be in the directory /tmp....). Then
click on the button.

This is why the directory gets reset back to directory where mred was
started as noticed above. This seems to be part of the problem.

 This should be fixed to use the current-directory when wx:make-eventspace
 is called. I'll take over the PR until this is done.

 Okay. That doesn't solve our original problem. I think that my proposed
 solution makes sense, but it's probably better if I get some windows user's 
 input....

 A problem still exists: the initial directory is right, but starting
 up with a file is wrong.

 HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH appear to be NT-specific environment
 variables.  Does the same error occur in Win95?

 I'd suggest that it's probably desirable. 
 I haven't used a language interpreter where the
 current directory meant anything else.

 I'm not sure I follow what's going on here.  
 
 Is MrEd looking for applications in %HOMEDRIVE%HOMEPATH because
 it's setting the directory to find mredrc.ss?  Can MrEd 
 use those environment variables to find the resource file,
 without actually changing the directory?  That would give the
 behavior suggested by Robby, which I think is desirable.

 Yes. HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are not set by default in Windows 95, but
 you can set them.

 At some point it was decided that MrEd should move to the user's home
 directory (as defined by HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH) after starting
 MrEd. This does, in fact, happen now (you'll have to the the variables
 to see it), although it didn't when I wrote the above entry. It is
 still unclear to me whether this is desirable behavior.

 Indeed, mredrc.ss can be loaded without changing the working
 directory. I am happy to see the auto-chdir go, which seems to mean
 that I agree with eveyone else. That change would almost certainly
 cure the file-opening bug.

 Hmmmmm ...
 
 Switching directories on startup is not typical
 Windows behavior.  Most Windows programs
 run where you start them, to my knowledge.  Win95
 shortcuts give you an option where to start programs,
 in case the .EXE's location is not where it should
 start.
 
 That said, it's not unreasonable to use environment
 variables to find resource or other startup files.
 But using the user's home directory is a Unix
 idiom, not typical of Windows at all.  Specifically,
 .INI files usually live where the .EXE lives, or in the
 Windows directory.
 
 As support for the latter, I cite
 MS's installation guidelines:
 
 http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/guidelns/setup.htm
 
 > Store private initialization (.INI) files in the
 > application directory if the application is running
 > locally, or in the directory returned by the
 > GetWindowsDirectory function if the application is
 > shared.
 
 I think the most Windows-like behavior would be:
 
 	1) MrEd runs where it's started
 	2) MRED.INI goes where the .EXE lives
 	3) MrEd looks for mredrc.ss where it starts,
 	     unless there's an environment variable,
 	     say PLTRCPATH, defined
 
 As an instance of the approach in (3), ProComm, for instance, uses an
 environment variable to find its
 data files.

 Yes, let's go for it.
 
 Should I take over these changes, as suggested
 by your PR list?

 I'd prefer to leave mred.ini and mredrc.ss as they are, i.e., loaded
 from mred.exe's directory by default, or HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH if it's
 defined. This works for W95 where HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH are not usually
 defined. It also works for NT, where HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH tends to be
 defined, and there tend to be multiple users. Even better for NT would
 be to use the Profiles directory, but let's save that one for another
 day.

 Ok. I think it will be a change in collects/system, so you'll need to
 coordinate with Robby.

Do you suggest that the mred and drscheme applications set the directory,
after they have opened the files?
