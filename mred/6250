State-Changed-When: Mon Jul 21 09:45:52 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    Possibly fixed for v205 (or, more specifically, v204.9).
    
    I say "possibly" because I don't really know the right
    way to fix it, and it may now work only for US keyboards.
    Let me know when you get a chance ot try it.
    
    Thanks,
    Matthew

Reason>>> fixed in v360 (at least, I'm pretty sure it's fixed this time)
