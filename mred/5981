>Description:
I'm running Mac OS X 10.2 (the problem also occurred in 10.1).  If I double-click a file whose name ends in ".scm", the OS opens DrScheme as expected (it shows the logo, the progress bar, and the plug-in icons), but once it's open, it produces the error message "file-exists?: pathname is empty", and refuses to do anything after that except quit.  I have to start DrScheme by itself, then open the file from the File menu.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
