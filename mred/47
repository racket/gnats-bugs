>Description:
I start up DrScheme, and the Check Syntax button at the top has a
black magnifying glass on a white background.  When I go into the REP
and enter, say, 3, the answer comes back in blue, and the icon (not
the text) changes color to a black m.g. on a deep blue background
(which looks like the same blue as the result in the REP).

This renders the icon virtually invisible.

I presume this is an X colormap thing, and there's not much that can
be done about it.  At least a different color for it to change to
would be good -- at first it looked like the icon for Check Syntax was
just a blue square, which didn't make sense at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
As above.  Maybe you need to be on stan; if so, come by.

 This and other variations have been a problem for a long time.
 Mred just doesn't handle colormaps well.  I've even seen the
 problem when I start drscheme, eval (+ 1 2) in interactions
 window, and then the Check Syntax changes to the blue color
 used for the result 3.
 
 Part of the problem is that "Check Syntax" is not text,
 it's a bitmap.  So, the color that's displayed is actually
 whatever color is at some index in the colormap. 
 
 I'm wondering if the problem goes away at color depth >= 16.
 new-world's console has color depth 16.  Robby, do you see
 the problem there?

 I (and I presume Matthew) never see that. (Maybe why the bug has been there
 so long :)

 I see it all the time on hong-kong. There's just only so much that can
 be done at once.
