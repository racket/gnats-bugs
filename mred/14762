>Description:
MacType is a font rendering software that can replace Windows's "ClearType" with Mac's font rendering algorithm. With MacType, individual characters in DrRacket look fine, but they look terrible altogether. This doesn't happen to other software on Windows with MacType in effect, or DrRacket on Mac.
