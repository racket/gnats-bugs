 That's because the canvas doesn't have the focus; clicking moves it
 there.
 
 You can call the canvas's `focus' method to have the focus start in the
 canvas.
 
 Yes, different platforms behave in different ways with respect to the
 initial focus; the problem is that they all have different focus
 policies, in general.

 Okay, so now I have three questions:
 
    1) should the click that focuses the canvas also be passed to 
 on-event (ie, does that happen consistently across platforms (if not, 
 should it?))
    2) are mouse movement events always sent to unfocused windows?
    3) is this documented somewhere (at least a range of possibilities, 
 even if no comittments about which platforms do what)?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yes.

 Yes, except when some window has grabbed the mouse (during a drag).

 I don't see the click-moves-focus part; I'll add that.
