>Description:
The checks that are performed by "map-function" are not sufficient
to guarantee that keymaps cannot be chained together.  For example, if
this code is run:

  (define k (make-object keymap%))
  (send k add-function "one" void)
  (send k add-function "two" void)
  (send k map-function "c:d;c:c" "one")
  (send k map-function "c:c;c:d" "two")

mred responds with the cryptic error message:

  keymap: key c + control is not a prefix key
  keymap: key d + control is a prefix key

However, if the same two keys are mapped in two different
keymaps and they are chained together no error message is 
reported. See below for the code.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define k (make-object keymap%))
(define e (make-object keymap%))
(send k add-function "one" void)
(send e add-function "two" void)
(send k map-function "c:d;c:c" "one")
(send e map-function "c:c;c:d" "two")
(send k chain-to-keymap e #t)

 JFYI, I was aware of this limitation, and planned to document it better
 in a near-term revision of the docs.
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew

No plans to add checking on chaining, but I plan to change the
documentation.
