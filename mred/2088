>Description:
I'm using DrScheme 103 on Win 2000 and I've some problems to control the 
focus by program. From a bigger application I have extracted the short 
example below. The buttons are simulating other parts which have to set
the focus to certain input areas. All works fine with the buttons 
"focus to second" and "focus to third", but if the window is hidden 
and shown again, it will not set the focus.
>How-To-Repeat:
(make-object
  (class* dialog% () initvars
    (private (the-panel void)
             (ed1 void)
             (ed2 void))
    (sequence (super-init "TEST" #f 200 200 200 200 null)
              (set! the-panel (make-object vertical-panel% this
'(border)))
              (set! ed1 (make-object editor-canvas% the-panel 
                          (make-object text% 1.0 null)
                          '(no-hscroll no-vscroll) 1))
              (set! ed2 (make-object editor-canvas% the-panel 
                          (make-object text% 1.0 null)
                          '(no-hscroll no-vscroll) 1))
              (make-object button% "test" the-panel
                (lambda (x y) 
                  (send this show #f)
                  (send this show #t)
                  (send ed1 focus))
                null)
