>Description:
(On Linux)
Usually, the left/right arrow keys move menus, unless the current selection
is a submenu.  In that case, the right key moves inside the submenu but
then it doesn't go on to the next menu.  Same for the left arrow key, which
is slightly worse since it's unexpected behavior.

Also, I think that the UI will be better if the submenu doesn't pop until
entered (enter/right, or hover the mouse, or at least some delay...).
