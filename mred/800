 Thanks for the bug report. The answer is the sort you have become used
 to by now :) - media-text% has gone away (replaced by text-field%),
 and MrEd 100 defines all control classes so a that callback function
 must be specified. On the other hand, `void' is just as handy as
 `null' for specifying a don't-care callback (in either 53 or 100).
 
 Some good news for 100: we've developed a system for extracting class
 descriptions out of the documentation and checking them against the
 implementation. While this checking is not as precise as we'd like
 with respect to argument types, hundreds (literally) of documentation
 bugs have been fixed, many like the one you reported. The MrEd 100
 documentation will be far more reliable than then 53 docs.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
