The mred and drscheme scrollbars don't work.
Problem seen on freebsd (nw) and solaris (asia).
This worked in 47.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start drscheme -x or mred -x.
Eval several trivial expressions to force a scrollbar.
Click any mouse button on top of the scrollbar and try
to move it up and down.  It doesn't move.
