centering doesn't work in the vertical direction. Seems to be off by
about 20 pixels (too low) with my wm.

State-Changed-Why:

This is a general X problem, not Motif-specific, and not
center-specific since it derives from X's schizophrenic attitude about
WM borders for sizing and placement. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem
to be anything that can be done about it. As far as I can tell (and
I've looked very closely) there's no way in X Windows to get
information from the window manager about the size of decorations that
it wraps around a frame. (I even tried a couple of hacks that didn't
work.) I'm closing the PR since it seems hopeless, but I'll continue
to stay alert for the next few years to any information that would
show me how to fix the problem.
