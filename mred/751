>Description:
There are two anoying problems. With both mzscheme and mred there is one
perl script that expects perl to be in /usr/local/bin. In Linux it is in
/usr/bin. A warning about the need for this change might be helpful.

I compiling mred the gnumake program must exist. On Linux sustems
if you run: gmake wx
The first command tries to execute gnumake on a file. This may be
 a Linux problem, but to get pased this I had to make gnumake a softlink
to make , which on a Linux system is gmake.

These are anoying not maybe earth shattering problems.

State-Changed-Why:

The Perl problem is resolved. It's called explcitily as `perl' in the
Makefiles, and Perl can be configured through the PERL variable in
make.env and/or mzmake. The default `make' in make.env is now just
`make' to accomodate Linux, the most likely build candidate.
