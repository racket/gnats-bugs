>Description:
In a large buffer, the scroll bar's last position may refer to several
different lines of text.

I propose that the last position int he scroll bar be reserved for when
the last line is actually visible and only when that last line is visible.

Same for the first line.

If that is not too difficult to implement, of course.... (this should be a change request, but the online bug reporting form isn't powerful enough)

I'm rather certain that MacOS has control over where the thumb goes
for various scroll positions, but I'll double-check...
