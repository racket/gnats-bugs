>Description:
When selecting text in DrScheme, after releasing the mouse button it crashes and returns the following program error:

// error
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  18 (X_ChangeProperty)
  Value in failed request:  0x40
  Serial number of failed request:  11567
  Current serial number in output stream:  11568
// error

I am using Ubuntu 5.10 64bit version.
my pc: athlon amd64 4000+ / 2gb Ram ddr / nvidia 7800gtx

I hope this error is fixed soon since my schooltasks depend on DrScheme to work on my pc.

The version i'm using is DrScheme 209 and trying to install an i386 version of DrScheme simply doesn't work on my system.
>How-To-Repeat:
open DrScheme on a 64bit version of Ubuntu 5.10 (aka Breezy Badger). Start typing some text, then select it, release mouse button and watch your work go down the drain if you haven't saved.

Thanks for the report! This problem has been
fixed in the v299 series. (We're working toward
a final v300 release soon.)
