Under Windows, this example should work, but in Unix, no. (keeping in mind
the face string changes in the unix version.)
>How-To-Repeat:
; This works under Windows
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 100))
(define t (make-object text%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send t insert "abcdef")
(define sd (make-object style-delta%))
(send sd set-delta-face "Fixedsys" 'base)
(send t change-style sd 2 4)
(send f show #t)

; This does not work in unix.
(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 100 100))
(define t (make-object text%))
(define ec (make-object editor-canvas% f t))
(send t insert "abcdef")
(define sd (make-object style-delta%))
(send sd set-delta-face "fixed" 'base)
(send t change-style sd 2 4)
(send f show #t)

 Fixed for the next release. MrEd/X didn't correctly handle face names
 without a leading '-'.
 
 The fixed source is already exp-tagged, and if you want, I can slip a
 new Solaris executable into ~scheme/plt. (It's a bit sloppy to do that
 without changing the version number, but if you're blocked on this
 problem, it will at least let you get work done.)
 
 Thanks for the problem report,
 Matthew
