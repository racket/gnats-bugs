MrEd and DrScheme does not accept Scandinavian letters - øåæ - in strings which they should. They do not either accepts them in identifiers which would be nice. MzScheme does both.

So how do I add an extra unit to make this possible?

Are Scandinavian letters entered with the control key? 

If so, does evaluating
  (wx:special-control-key #f)
fix the problem?

I expect that the problem is the following: we use the control key for
various Emacs-like bindings in the editor, so the control key is
intercepted. But if the above fixes your problem, then we should
disable our special control-key patch by default, to support
non-English languages, and only have it enabled via a Preference.
