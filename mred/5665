>Description:
I believe the on-move method in window<%> needs some flow analysis on it's contract. I got "on-move in window<%>: expects argument of type <exact integer in [-10000, 10000]>; given -14724" as a drscheme internal error. 

>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot reproduce this error sadly. I can say that it occured when I opened a drscheme window with file->open and nearly simoltaneously (excuse spelling) move the new window and rolled up (X Windows roll up) the other drscheme window. The
new window was moved to the coordinate 0,0 on my screen immediately after the drscheme internal error messagebox appeared.

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
