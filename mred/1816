Hi,
I have downloaded and installed drscheme, but I cannot start mred or drscheme. I can, however, run drscheme-jr successfully. Here is the error that I get when I try to launch mred:

ld.so.1: [Path for the plt directory]/plt/.bin/sparc-solaris/mred: fatal: libSM.so.6: open failed: No such file or directory
Killed

Please let me know how I can fix this problem ASAP. I appreciate your help.
Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Unzip and install drscheme;
2. go to the /bin directory;
3. type mred and press return.

---> the error is produced and mred is Killed

 Most likely you will have to compile your own mred binary. It should be
 relatively painless:
 
  1. download and unpack the source distribution (available from the
     same page as the binary distributions)
 
  2. cd plt/src   in the unpacked source archive
 
  3. configure
 
  4. make
 
  5. cp mred/mred ..../plt/.bin/sparc-solaris/mred 
     where "...." is the path to your already-installed PLT tree

 On my Solaris setup, libSM.so.6 is in /usr/lib.
 
 Do you have that file?
 
 Another thing to check is the environment variable 
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  On my system, it's set to
 
   /usr/site/X11R5/lib:/usr/local/lib
 
 I believe that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used to supplement 
 the default search path, so /usr/lib should be 
 checked even without it.  But maybe there's 
 some funny interaction going on.

Presumably LD_LIBRARY_PATH or recompiling fix the problem.
