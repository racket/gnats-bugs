>Description:
The font setting in the preferences has no effect on the definition window:
I can change the font and the font size, and the little example
text in the rpeference panel is updated correctly, but the text in the definition
window is not affected at all. The text in the definition window uses some
unknown font.
The font setting correctly affects the text in the interaction window, the text
of this bug report, and, curiously, the text in the definition window once it's
been colored using check-syntax (but then modifying the text or executing
it makes the unknown font show up again).
The problem started showing up after I updated from alpha20 to alpha21.
Removing all the preference files and starting again didn't help.

 this appears to be a problem specific to solaris and alpha21. Do you
 see it?

 Can you try using 200alpha19 to make sure that the problem is specific
 to alpha21 (or so)?
 
 I don't see the problem on my machines, but none of them are Solaris.
 
 Thanks,

 No, I don't see it. Did you see the problem in Solaris yourself?
 
 Maybe a font problem? But presumably the default font in DrScheme
 hasn't changed since alpha20. I can't think of anything that changed in
 the C code.

 How does one do that? It seems difficult to get the cvs archives in a
 consistent state from a while back, due to the exp-tagging.

 On Philippe's computer, yes.

 It was wierd. I don't have any good ideas -- I couldn't find the docs
 on the font changing stuff -- is there still something like
 .mred.resources where you can set low level font settings?

 .mred.resources has been subsumed by .plt-prefs.ss. It's documented in
 the MrEd manual, one of the last chapters.

 The reason I suggested 200alpha19 instead of 200alpha20 is that you can
 download a bundle for 200alpha19.

 200alpha19 is fine. The 200alpha21 compiled by Paul S. seems to be
 fine too. So I'm currently recompiling my whole tree from scratch
 after doing a "make clean", to see what happens, but I suspect this
 should solve the problem...
