>Description:
I created an editor an put some (2) snips in it.
When I positioned the cursor in the first snip
and typed it caused exponential insertions before crashing.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Enter this program in the definitions pane of DrScheme
(define display-editor%
  (class text%
    (super-instantiate () (auto-wrap #t))
    (inherit insert)
    (public display-string)

    (define display-string
      (lambda (str)
        (do-display (open-input-string str))))
    
    (define do-display
      (lambda (i-port)
        (if (and (char-ready? i-port)
                 (not (eof-object? (peek-char i-port))))
            (let ([snp (make-object string-snip% (read-line i-port))])
              (unless (eof-object? (peek-char i-port))
                (send snp set-flags (cons 'hard-newline (send snp get-flags))))
              (insert snp)
              (do-display i-port))
            (void))))))

2. Execute
3. Position the cursor on the first line.
4. Type

Results:
1. You get an additional snip for each character typed.
2. Ultimately, it will crash.

State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Mon Feb 11 12:08:17 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    A part of the text% implementation implicitly assumed that
    'hard-newline implies a snip% with a count of 1.
    
    Fixed for the next release (soon to be exp-tagged in
    CVS, after a bit more testing).
