>Description:
The shortcut key for COPY and/or PASTE does not work properly.  If you 
attempt to copy something by highlighing and then pressing Ctrl-C, you can 
not paste with Ctrl-V.  However, if you copy with Ctrl-C and use PASTE from 
the pull down menu under Edit, then it works OK.  This same thing happened on 
two different PCs running Windows 98.

State-Changed-When: Wed Aug  2 18:25:40 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed for version 103.

In 102, menu items are enabled/disabled as appropriate via the
`on-demand' method of the menu item. `on-demand' is called when the
user clicks on the menu bar to select a menu.

`on-demand' is not currently called, however, before processing a
keyboard event as a potential menu selection.

Hence the confusing behavior. Before you touch the menu bar, all menu
key bindings work fine (because the initial state is enabled). When you
touch the menu bar the first time, you set the enable state of various
menu items, and they stay that way until you use the menu bar again. So
whether the `cut' keybinding works depends on whether anything was
selected the last time you clicked on the menu bar.
