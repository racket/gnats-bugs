>Description:
I am one of those weirdos you see who've configured their taskbar to be along the *top* of the screen, rather than the bottom.

A number of applications, DrScheme and NTEmacs among them, seem to insist on opening their main window at (0, 0) - *right* underneath the start button.

This makes the title bar, window menu, and close button all inaccessible. The workaround is to right-click in the taskbar and choose "move", and then use the arrow keys to move the window to a location where you can get at the title bar again.
>How-To-Repeat:
Move the taskbar to the top of the screen.
Open DrScheme.
Try moving the window around (it's tricky).

 Does it help if you use the "Autohide" option for the taskbar?

 Not really - that's a workaround that's worse than the problem :-)
 I find the autohide feature quite difficult to use - the timeouts are 
 set all wrong and it feels overly sensitive.
 
 I've worked around the problem for Emacs by setting the Emacs.geometry 
 property equivalent in the registry. Perhaps there's a similar setting 
 for DrScheme I could use?
 
 Alternatively, would the "quick hack" solution of making new windows 
 open at (32, 32) be too ugly to consider? (One reason it might be 
 rejected would be if it was difficult to arrange in a suitably 
 cross-platform manner...)
 
 Ah, if only Windows had separated out the window-manager properly! 
 Sawfish would go down a treat right now... :-)
