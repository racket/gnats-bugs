>Description:
The command method of a check box does not invoke the callback.
>How-To-Repeat:

evaluating this code:

[define f [make-object wx:frame% null "test" 0 0 100 100]]
[define p [make-object wx:panel% f]]
[define c [make-object wx:check-box% p 
		       [lambda x 
			 [display 'hi]
			 [newline]]
		       "hello"]]
[send f show #t]
[define [set-check-box-to b]
  [define evt 
    (make-object 
     wx:command-event% 
     wx:const-event-type-checkbox-command)]
  (send evt set-event-object c)
  [send* c 
    [set-value b]
    [command evt]]]

[set-check-box-to #t]
[set-check-box-to #f]

does not cause any printouts, but clicking on the checkbox manually
does.

Responsible-Changed-When: Thu Feb  5 16:09:46 1998
Responsible-Changed-Why:

It looks like I was wrong: 3 out of 4 implementations agree that
wx:item%'s command is supposed to use the event to change the state of
the item as well as pass it on to the callback procedure.

The dissenting implementation (Xt - the one you're using) will be
coerced into agreement and the documentation will be changed to say
something useful.
