>Description:
I installed PLT Scheme and it seems to work fine. I can type in functions, check their syntax and run them. But if I try to use "File>>Open...", "File>>Save Definitions As..." or "Language>>Add Teachpack..." it just hangs and I have to terminate the process.  I run Windows Vista Home Premium 32 bit, on an intel Core2 T7200 with 2Gb RAM. I've un-installed & re-installed with no change.  I do not have any more information as the program does not give me any more feedback.

 Matthew -- I asked Roman to try the nightly build, and it had the same
 problem.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:44 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
