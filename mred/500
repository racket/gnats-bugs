Solaris
>Description:
The gray box surrounding the text inclosed by ()'s is too big for
()'s in comments.  Should ()'s in comments be hilighted?  It would
be kind of nice.  In 50s1, nothing is hilighted when I place my cursor
at the end of the closing paren in the comment, but the parens in the
comment _are_ hilighted when I place the cursor before the `(' in the
comment.
>How-To-Repeat:
Place the cursor at the end of the comment in the following program
---
()
; ()
---

this is a documented shortcoming of the paren matcher and won't be fixed
soon.
