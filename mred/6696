>Environment:
windows-9x
>Description:
In the last step of the install ("Execute: 'C:\Program Files\PLT-FULLCVS-206.1\MrEd.exe' -qC- install -i"), windows sends me this error :
"Mred has caused an error in
LIBMZSCH206_001.DLL
Mred will now close"
Same error when running "MrED.exe", "Finish Install.exe" in PLT directory.
DrScheme.exe isn't created.
I had the same errors with older releases (203 to 205).
Please tell me how to fix, I need DrScheme in my studies.

(If you still have problems, the best that we know so far 
is that you can try to disable your network while 
installing.)
