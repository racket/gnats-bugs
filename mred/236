 It happened again, and now I have conjecture. It seems to happen _after_ I
 have used Turtles or Sixlib to draw something. Then, when I start up drs
 again, I get an all-blue screen.

 I have another conjecture for PR's 232 and 236.
 I wonder if mred or drscheme has a colormap leak.
 
 I've been doing my editing for the gui tester in drscheme.
 I'll start drscheme in the morning and leave it running all day.
 Today (Tues, Aug 12), at the end of the day, I started getting
 wx warnings about cannot allocate color.  First it said
 "using approximate match" and then "Colour allocation failed, 
 using black," and then my entire screen went crazy (mostly
 reverse video).  It even stayed crazy after quitting drscheme.
 
 I'm careful about starting drscheme before netscape so drscheme
 can allocate its colors first.  And I wasn't doing anything that
 would be requesting new colors.  The code is all inside a unit,
 so I can't Execute it, and I can't even run Check-Syntax. :-(
 All I do is edit.
 
 This was in fvwm95, drscheme -x, running on new-world, displayed
 on aten.

 The next time you fire up DrS or Netscape, your X session will crash. Save
 your files.
