>Description:
GUI takes unicode in constructor and display the unicode character correctly.
But when the unicode character is set to label via set-label method, the character is displayed as question mark "????".
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start Drscheme
2. Copy and paste second example from 
   "Chapter 2: Windowing Toolbox Overview" of "PLT MrEd: Graphical Toolbox Manual"
3. Change string in message% constructor and set-label in callback to unicode string
   For example

 (define frame (instantiate frame% ("Example")))
 (define msg (instantiate message% ("????" frame)))
 (instantiate button% () (label "Click Me") (parent frame)
              (callback (lambda (button event) (send msg set-label "????"))))
 (send frame show #t)

4. Evaluate the code
5. Notice that the label of message is displayed correctly.
6. Press "Click Me" button
7. The label is not displayed as "????"
