State-Changed-Why:
This bug has been fixed and a new sparc-solaris-motif version
is released.

The problem was that MrEd implements disabled windows by intercepting
--- and then not dispatching --- certain types of events for a
disabled window.  For reasons that aren't clear, this confuses the
pointer-grab mechanism in Motif for popup menus. The solution is a
HUGE hack: instead of throwing away a mouse-down event for a disabled
window, dispatch the event, but first modify it to point it at a
window that ignores mouse-down events (there's always one such window
hanging around, although you never see it).
