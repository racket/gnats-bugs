>Description:
I've installed DrScheme linux distribution on Mandrake 9.2 according to the instructions on the web site. 
Running 'drscheme' command produces the following message:
"/usr/local/lib/plt/bin/mred: error while loading shared libraries: libpng.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory".
I'm able to run 'mzscheme'.
