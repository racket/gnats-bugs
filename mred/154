>Environment:
Linux version; downloaded this afternoon from DrScheme Web page
>Description:
DrScheme gives this error on the second start-up:

  read: expected a ')'; started at position 996, line 80 in
  /home/shriram/.mred.prefs

>How-To-Repeat:
I had a PLT bundle about two weeks old.  I downloaded DrScheme and
started it up without deleting my .mred.prefs.  It started up fine.  I
evaluated one or two expressions but didn't change any settings; then
I quit.  When I started it up a second time, I got this error.  Once I
deleted the .mred.prefs, it was working fine again (I started it up
several times).

I don't know if this will affect outside users who have old
.mred.prefs (as opposed to mine, which was of intermediate age).

Responsible-Changed-Why:

I think that your .mred.presf must have been corrupted since I write 1
sexpression and read 1 sexpression from the .mred.prefs file
