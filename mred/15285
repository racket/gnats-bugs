>Description:
The program below runs smoothly when DrRacket is 
first started or when the mouse is not moving. 
When DrRacket has been running for several hours 
and I swirl the mouse while the program is running,
the frame rate drops to 5-10 frames per second.
As soon as the mouse stops moving, the frame rate
jumps back up again and the animation is smooth.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Start DrRacket.
2) Use DrRacket for 3-5 hours of development work.
3) Run this program while swirling the mouse:

#lang racket

(require 2htdp/universe
        2htdp/image)

(define r (rectangle 40 40 'solid 'green))

;; represents a position on the screen
(struct posn (x y) #:transparent)

;; in seconds:
(define TRANSITION-TIME 1)

;; in frames per second
(define FRAME-RATE 40)

(define SCENEWIDTH 400)
(define SCENEHEIGHT 300)

(define transition-frames (* TRANSITION-TIME FRAME-RATE))

;; given frame number, overlay
;; image at the correct location
(define (draw-world w)
  (define frac (/ (modulo w transition-frames) transition-frames))
  (define 1-frac (- 1 frac))
  (place-image r (+ (* 1-frac 50) (* frac 100))
               (+ (* 1-frac 120) (* frac 115))
               bg-scene))

(define bg-scene (empty-scene SCENEWIDTH SCENEHEIGHT))

(big-bang 0
          [to-draw draw-world]
          [on-tick add1 (/ 1 FRAME-RATE)])

4) observe very low frame rate.
