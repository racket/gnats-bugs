	drscheme -x, MacOS
>Description:
	When value sets are shown in a MrSpidey buffer, searching
can produce an internal error that says something about a
find-string-embedded method not found. (I'm not sure of the exact
method name.)
>How-To-Repeat:
	Run DrScheme, analyze a program, show a value set, start
searching from before the value set for something that cannot be found
until after the value set.
>Fix:

Probably the media-edits in the media-snips that display types are not
mred:edit%, they are wx:media-edit% instead. You may also be intersted in 
want to (send edit set-auto-set-wrap #f) and create a subclass that
overrides autowrap-bitmap to null.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

MrSpidey creates a mred:media-snip%, which contains a default
wx:media-edit%, which is arguably wrong. MrSpidey now overrides this
default setting, but mred's default should also be changed.
