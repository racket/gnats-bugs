Human Language: english
>Description:
Arrows are not drawn when the mouse is over a bound identifier if the mouse scroll wheel has been used. If a mouse button is clicked after the scroll wheel has been used, then arrows drawing returns to normal.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a program in DrScheme. Click Check Syntax. Identifier arrows should be drawn as expected. Scroll window using scroll wheel on mouse. Arrow drawing fails to happen. Click the left button on the interior of the definitions window. Arrow drawing returns to normal.

Discovered in EOPL2 language, same behavior in R5Rs (others not tested).
