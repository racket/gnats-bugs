PLTers,

You don't have a category, "non critical, but we stumble over it often".

I'm writing only one bug report because it is vaguely dawning on me that these 2 problems are be related.

On Win95 osr 2 boxen, ctrl-C fails to cut most of the time. Occasionally it seems to work if I do it very slowly.

The ctrl X and the rest work fine.

I haven't gone around loading the good Dr on other platforms but this holds consistently both on my AMD-K6 boxen & my laptop, both with win 95 osr 2.

The other problem is that if I use the numeric keypad, then it sends doubled numbers 11 22 33 and so on on the same machines.

I have the (extremely) hazy idea that these could both be caused by touching the KB in some old fashioned low-level way rather than some new-fangled Microsoft sanctioned sort of way.

Cheers to all, 

Jack
>How-To-Repeat:

Both just happen all the time. 

prob 1: try copying to clipboard
prob 2: turn on numlock and send some numbers

 Both bugs have been fixed in version 103, due to be released in a
 couple of days.
 
 Thanks for the bug reports,
 Matthew
