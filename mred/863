 David,
 
 	During loading some file the programm crashes with following message:
 	"Pid 14637 received a SIGSEGV for stack growth failure.
 	 Possible causes: insufficient memory or swap space,
 	  or stack size exceeded maxssiz."
 
 It might be useful to see the file you tried to load.
 Could you send that?
 
 Also, what operating system are you running?

 David,
 
 	Thanks.  We'll have to investigate this problem,
 which doesn't appear in the more widely-used versions
 of DrScheme (Solaris, Windows, Mac).  Since we're
 on break just now, it may take a few weeks before we
 know more.

 David,
 
 	DrScheme uses the MrEd toolkit to handle graphics.
 Matthew Flatt, who deals with the system-level code for
 MrEd, says that the text widget in the Athena widget library under HP/UX 
 doesn't work right with MrEd, for unknown reasons.  The next
 release of MrEd won't have the problem you mention, because
 file dialogs will be implemented differently.  There's
 no release date, yet. 
 
         As a workaround, you can use 
 
 	(load filename)
 
 interactively.
