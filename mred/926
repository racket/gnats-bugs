[Note: this pr should be a change-request, but the online form doesn't have
that option]

After reading the documentation I do not see any way to re-order the menus
in a menubar, once the menus have been created. This poses a problem for
the organization of the framework.

Currently, there are three stages where menus are added to each frame. The
first two are implemented with mixins in the framework and the third is
implemented by the client program (in this case, drscheme).
Unfortunately, the mixin that creates the `windows' menu comes first, before
the mixin that creates the `file', `edit', and `help' menus, which comes
before any class that the framework's clients may use -- and that class
will create menus that should come between the `edit' and `help' menus.
This means that menus in the menubar are all out of order, and the help
menu doesn't slide over to the right side of the menubar, like it should.

I was planning to provide a function that would re-arrange the menus, after
the fact, in the framework. But, it does not seem possible to provide such
a function. 

Is it possible to enable the implementation of such a function (without replacing the menu*% classes), or is there some other way to achieve my
goal?

Thanks,
Robby

 If a menu item is deleted, its `restore' method puts the item at the
 end of its parent's list of children. Thus, you can re-arrange menu
 items (or menus in a menu bar) by deleting all but the first menu and
 restoring the rest in order. Perhaps `add' would be a better name than
 `restore' for this method?
 
 It would be nice to have a `change-items' method in
 menu-item-container<%> (analogous to `change-children' in
 area-container<%>). I'll put it on the medium-term list.

This hasn't come up again, and it's not clear that there's any
advantage to having a built-in method. Closed for now. Will reconsider
if the change request pops up again.
