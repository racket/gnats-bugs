>Description:
Unforutnately, I cannot paste code here, so I will just describe what my
small example does.

First, it creates a bitmap with a filename initializer, specifically the
execute.bmp file in PLT/collects/icons/, and 'bmp.

Then, it creates another bitmap with three initialization arguments:
the width of the first bitmap, the height of the first bitmap, and -1.

Then, it copies the first bitmap into the second, and creates a button
to display the bitmap. The button's label appears blank.

It could be that the "-1" above should have been rejected, or it could be
a problem copying bitmaps between different depths? (if those are
different depths?)

The display has 256 colors.

 -1 is interpreted as #t for the `monochrome?' bitmap% initialization
 argument.
 
 The effect of copying color->b&w bitmaps is underspecified, and I'll
 have to look into what is implemented. It may be that X doesn't copy
 the bitmap at all.

 Oh, crap. I always forget that boolean stuff. I guess that there is no
 chance of requiring boolean arguments to be either #t or #f?
 
 I guess that I have asked this before, and you didn't like the idea. But, in
 this case I spent the usual 30 minutes or an hour making a nice small
 example and I would have only spend 1 or 2 minutes reading the error message
 and the documentation if "-1" was an illegal input. (I have a drscheme
 window on my screen as of yesterday! :)
