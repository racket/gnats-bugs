>Description:
The documentation for bitmap-dc% indicates that the 10th argument for draw-bitmap-section-smooth is a 'mask'. However the following error message is received when using #f for the 'mask':

draw-bitmap-section-smooth: expects type <'solid, 'opaque, or 'xor> as 10th argument

 Hi Kieron,
 
 I'm following up on this bug report.  I disagree: the function
 draw-bitmap-section-smooth is documented to have, at most, 12
 arguments, of which the 12th argument is the mask, and the 10th
 argument is the style.  The error message is correct in that you're
 trying to pass #f into the style, which isn't legal.
 
 Do you agree with this?
 
 I'll close this bug report unless there's a followup to this.

 Danny,
 
 The documentation is correct, I can't remember what exactly I saw, so I'm
 not sure if it was always the same.
 
 I see now that draw-bitmap-section-smooth takes either 9 *or* 12 arguments.
 I somehow missed that fact and tried to use only 10 and therefore the error
 message makes sense.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Kieron.
