>Description:
On each platform, there are platform-specific system alert dialogs. For example, on OS X there should be an alert dialog with the application icon as 96x96 icon on the left (possibly with a badge, e.g. a warning sign above the icon), no dialog title, a bold heading, some alert text and up to 3 buttons (one default confirmation, a cancel button and an optional button).

It would be great to have a unique interface for showing a modal alert dialog like it's usual on the platform. The current custom textfield alerts are functional but look  odd on OS X and Classic Mac OS.

 This will be available later today in 202.1.
 
 Also, a dialog with a parent frame will display as a sheet in 202.1.
