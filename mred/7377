 I meant to CC robby but forgot.
 
 (I just needed to classify this bug since it went in in some wrong
 format.)

 Just to clarify, once an open window is minimized to the dock by via
 clicking on it's "-" button control, DrScheme's menus are lost permanently
 until the window is closed and then reopened.
 
 And suspect the problem is related to 7385, where each time the window's
 "+" button control is clicked twice (once to expand and then subsequently
 shrink it back to it's original size), the window's height continuously
 grows by what appears to be the height of it's title-bar; so suspect
 something overall has changed with respect to the treatment of OSX's
 window event handling controls and/or sizing assumptions, as this is a
 recent problem.

 confirmed, many thanks.
 
 (but can also confirm that even with the frame maximize tweak today,
 the window's height still grows when pressing the + button after the
 window was expanded, which should only return it to it's previous size?)
 
 [I'm using 10.3.9 but don't think it should make a difference?]

 This is puzzling. I did fix something like that long ago, at least as
 it appears on my machine, and it doesn't happen for me.
 
 Is it as simple as starting MrEd, clicking the "+", and then clicking
 again?

 10.3.X makes a difference compared to 10.4.X, but I use both.

 - yup just verified the same on MrEd, it grows about a 1/4" per iteration?
 
   for reference I'm compiling with:
 
     gcc version 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1666)
 
   if that may make any difference?

 22 pixels, I'm sure. 
 
 Are you running any interesting desktop extensions (e.g., a virtual
 screen manager)?

 - not that I was aware of, and to double check I did a safe boot, which I
 understand disables all non-apple stuff; and it did the same thing; and
 triple checked if there were any processes running that seemed out of place.
 
 (the only thing that I could think of that might fool with the windowing
 system was virtual pc, who's kext's should have been fully disabled when I
 did a safe boot?)

 I tried safe-boot on my machine, too, and I still get working behavior.
 
 What happens if you change line 50 of
    plt/src/wxmac/src/mac/wx_frame.cxx
 to initialize os_x_post_tiger to 1? To -1?

 I set it to both = 1 then = -1, ran make & make install, and launched MrEd
 after each time, and it still grows the window height?

 (so wonder if the height of the widow's StatusPanel or drag corner is now
  being included in the window height records were it wasn't before?)

 I believe I tracked the problem down to line: 616
 
   ::ZoomWindowIdeal(theMacWindow, maximize ? inZoomOut : inZoomIn, &size);
 
 which when zooming in, is supposed to set the widow state to the previously
 set ideal window state via SetWindowIdealUserState, which doesn't appear
 to be happening? (as a result the window state ends up being a bit too
 high, likely because it's height is modified directly without officially
 updating the "ideal" window state?)

 I'm stumped then. This is the big change in 299.10x compared to
 299.100. Or has this been broken for you for an even longer time?

 - after some further experimentation, I'm convinced that the manual tracking
 of the window's zoomed (maximized) state is not being kept consistent with
 OSX's perception of IsWindowInStandardState(), resulting in the different
 tracking of the window's size, which may work on some versions of the OSX's
 carbon libraries, but not others.
 
 Overall, it seems that the best solution would likely be to universally
 adopt the use of Get/Set/Zoom WindowIdealUserState, as opposed to tracking
 and set it's sizing manually?
