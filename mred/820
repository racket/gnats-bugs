I'm a student taking Scheme at U New Mexico.

Whenever I run Dr. Scheme at home on Windows 95  it totally freezes VERY often and I can't get out except by hitting Control-Alt-Delete twice.

Today I uninstalled  what I had and downloaded it again(standard installation both times) and the problem showed up almost immediately again.  I ran MS Scandisk and it tells me my hard drive is OK.  

I'm no expert on Windows so I suppose I could be doing something elementarily wrong but I don't know.

Can this happen if I install DrScheme when I have remnants of DrScheme on my disk that I don't know about??

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  I love Scheme and would very much like to be able to run it at home.
