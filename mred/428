>Description:
A style delta whose face has been set doesn't seem to change text when it
is applied with change-style in an edit.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (make-object wx:frame% null "" 0 0 100 100))
(define c (make-object wx:media-canvas% f))
(define e (make-object wx:media-edit%))
(send c set-media e)
(send e insert "test")
(define l (send e last-position))
(define s1 (make-object wx:style-delta%))
(define s2 (make-object wx:style-delta%))
(send s1 set-face "-adobe-courier")
(send s2 set-face "-adobe-helvetica")
(define (one) (send e change-style s1 0 l))
(define (two) (send e change-style s2 0 l))
(two)
(send f show #t)

Then, evaluate (one) and (two). The canvas's contents should change and
they don't.

State-Changed-Why:

There was a bug in the style system when merging deltas where the
overriding delta has a face name but no family (i.e., the family is
set to wx:const-base).

In the above code, it's actually best to use set-delta-face instead of
set-face (I'll work on the documentation) so the family is set
correctly. (This is mostly important if the buffer is saved to a file
and then moved to another platform.) The above code works as expected
when set-style-face is used instead of set-face.

The face-without-family-delta-merging bug will be fixed in 51/11.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 30 21:00:17 1998
State-Changed-Why:

On closer inspection, it turns out that the font family is ignored
when a font face is specified. Thus, the only potentially useful
difference between set-face and set-delta-face (other than avoiding
the current bug) is that the latter returns the style delta rather
than void. In an ideal world, set-delta-face would be eliminated.

None of this was was explained in the documentation. The docs have
been fixed, too.
