>Description:
On OS X, nearly all windows I've seen so far can be minimized both by clicking on the yellow button and by double-clicking the title bar. DrScheme/MrEd windows can only be minimized by clicking the yellow button. (tested on OS X 10.2 6C115)


>How-To-Repeat:
Create a MrEd frame or open any DrScheme main editor dialog and double-click the titlebar. Nothing happens.
