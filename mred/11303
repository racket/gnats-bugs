>Description:
Copying text from DrRacket doesn't ever seem to put text on the Gnome clipboard. However, copying from Gnome applications to DrRacket seems to works as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
Highlight text in the DrRacket editor; copy it. Try to paste it in another Gnome application. Whatever was in the Gnome clipboard before will be pasted instead of the highlighted text.
