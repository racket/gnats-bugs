 I have the same version of the same os as you (judging from the
 environment line) and I'm not seeing that behavior.
 
 Out of curiosity, do you see that happening from a fresh drracket?

 By fresh drracket do you mean loading a new drracket window with nothing open, or a fresh install?
 It still happens on the former.

 I can replicate the behavior on my machine, so I should be able to fix
 it.
 
 Thanks!
