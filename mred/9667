 That would be the get-choices-from-user function.

 BTW, if this is the "other" menu entry in the font selection part of
 the preferences, then the dialog that comes up is fine on Linux.
 
 (There are two other pixel measurements issues though -- when the font
 popup menu shows it's not on the current font, so a single quick click
 changes the font; also, the "Other" line is only selected if the mouse
 is on its top few pixels, otherwise it's not selected.)

 Hm... MrEd and the Framework disagree on the style for X. 
 
 If Eli is happy with the current order, then I'll assume that the X
 convention these days is like the Mac and not like Windows, so I'll
 change MrEd.

 Does it make sense to have just a single point of control for this?
 The framework has one. Should it be replaced?
 
 Or maybe this is just part of a larger change that we'll do later?

 Note that under Gnome, the Mac order is standard (under KDE, the
 Windows order is standard).

 Is that the same as the alt vs control menu keybonding key?

 I care less about the order than about consistency[*], and it looks
 fine now, with "OK" on the right.  But checking a few things, it does
 seem that this is also the convention in gnome applications.
 
 (
 [*] I was surprised to discover that gnome and Windows are not the
 same, and the Windows thing seems less obvious to me now...  Maybe
 that's the source of my confusion with these supermarket digital
 signing things -- the "accept" and "cancel" are not in the right order
 and I often confuse them...

 You mean, whether `C-p' or `M-p' is the command for print (and the
 equivalent of Cmd-p on Macs)?
 
 In that case, no.  In both Gnome and KDE, it's always Control for the
 various menu options (as in Windows, I believe).

 these both are okay on the mac. One thing to note: the menu is
 initially created with only a single item (the current font). Clicking
 on the menu forces the computation of the names of the fonts (which is
 an expensive computation apparently).

 Yes, I think it's a problem specific to the X part.

 It looks like it's much less expensive on Linux (I just noticed a
 brief delay after reading the above), but in any case that unrelated
 to the problem that happens on the following clicks too.
