Dr Scheme runs our professorj code the first time with no problem. Each instance after that outputs that there is a syntax error. When you try to click the check syntax button, the system hangs then outputs a visual c++ runtime error and crashes the system.

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
