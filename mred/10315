>Description:
This bug happens on Windows with v4.2, not on Linux.

When the "install .plt file" dialog is open, I've seen two things happen as a result of using
tab, both bad:

1. Hit tab three times so the focus is on the "web" tab, then hit right to switch to the
   "file" tab, then hit tab a few times.  The focus moves to the "browse" button, then to the
   "filename" input box, then back to "browse" etc, no way to switch back without the mouse.

2. Right after the dialog opens (that is, *not* immediately after doing the above), use the
   mouse and click on the "file" dialog.  Hitting tab now leaves it spinning in a loop,
   slowly consuming all available memory.

 Can you re-test this with a recent version?  It's the sort of thing
 that may have gone away with 5.1.

 This was reconfirmed by stephen chang in Racket 5.2.1.
