>Description:
I am using the 64 bit verison of Racket on OSX Lion. When I start DrRacket the intitial window loads but doesn't become visible. I have to ALT+Tab and click on the icon in the dock to show the DrRacket window. There is no one thing that I have done to make the window show up. I can make it show eventually so I marked it as non-critical.

 I downloaded the 32-bit version for OSX. It does not act the same way.
 
 One other thing I noticed is that on the 64-bit version the initial loading screen doesn't show up either. It did the very first time but has not since. The 32-bit version loading screen shows up every time.

Reason>>> I think we've fixed this problem for the next release. To check,
you could try a pre-release build:
  http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/

Thanks for the report!

 No problem...I will try the pre-rel build.
 
 Hey, shouldn't the pre-rel build start with "rkt" and not "plt" now?  : )
 
 Thanks for all your work!

 Okay,
 
 I started it up. No splash screen.
 
 I tried to hide the window. The DrRacket menu item highlights but the window stays visible.
 
 Hitting the key combo to Quit...flashes the DrRacket menu item but the "Are you sure you want to quit?" is hidden behind the DrRacket window. That happens every time.
 
 Tried the pre-rel of the 32bit...and it works correctly.
 
 HTH,
 
 Bob

 If I change the 
 
  CFBundleIdentifier
 
 value in 
 
  DrRacket.app/Contents/Info.list
 
 to something other than 
 
  org.racket-lang.DrRacket
 
 then the application works. If I then change a 32-bit DrRacket to have
 the same new `CFBundleIdentifier', the 32-bit app is ok, but running
 the 64-bit app afterward no longer runs.
 
 It seems like the OS cannot deal with 32-bit and 64-bit apps that have
 the same bundle identifier, though it's always possible that we're
 doing something else wrong that is really the problem.
 
 Meanwhile, the only idea I have is to make sure that 64-bit apps get a
 different bundle identifier than the 32-bit counterpart.
