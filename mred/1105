>How-To-Repeat:
1) Create a file "d:/tmp.ss"
2) open drscheme's save dialog
3) type "d:/tmp.ss"

At this point, the save file dialog says "are you sure you want to delete
d:/tmp.ss?"

4) click "yes"
5) the file "tmp.ss.scm" is the filename that is actually used, making
the earlier prompt erroneous.

 This was Windows 95? (The PR doesn't say.) I'm not able to reproduce it
 in Windows 98. Perhaps Microsoft fixed the bug?
 
 As far as I can tell, there's nothing we can do about the problem in
 any case, since it's entirely internal to the put-file dialog.
 
 Steck: what happens in NT? Note that you might have configured .ss as
 an extension, so be sure to use a different (non-extension) suffix in
 your test.
