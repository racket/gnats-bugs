  From the download page (http://racket-lang.org/download/) click the 
 link labeled "All versions".

 Can you describe the process you went through to try to find previous
 versions of drracket? Would changing the text 'All versions' to 'All
 previous versions' on racket-lang.org/download help?

 Looks like the bug was filed with "corky.cartwright@racket-lang.org",
 so none of the replies below went anywhere.  I've changed the email to
 the one from your web page (cork@rice.edu).

 Version 5.1.2 might work on Intel machines running Mac OS X 10.4.
 
 We tried to recompile Racket's support libraries to make them run on
 10.4. Unfortunately, I don't have any 10.4 machines around anymore to
 test whether all of the libraries are compiled correctly. Another user
 with helped us for a while, but he dropped out before we got all of the
 libraries right.
 
 If you still have an Intel 10.4 machine and you try out version 5.1.2,
 please let us know whether it works.
 
 Thanks!
