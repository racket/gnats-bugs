>Description:

I dragged prefs.ss onto MrEd PPC (which was already running) and it paused
for a while and then died with a dialog saying "an error of type 2
occured. Please save your work and restart your computer". 

I had sucessfully dragged a file onto mred a little bit ago, but hadn't
done much in mred. If this is a memory problem, the default partition size
of mred needs to be much larger (I had edited 4 files, one at a time and
closed each before opening the next....).
