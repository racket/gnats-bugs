Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Wed, 27 Dec 2006 14:56:05 -0500
Reason>>> Possibly MrEd


Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Wed, 27 Dec 2006 14:57:42 -0500
Reason>>> I can't reproduce this, but hey. I'll pass it along to
Matthew in case he has some idea.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:48:10 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
