>Description:
(module test mzscheme
(require (lib "cards.ss" "games" "cards")
         (lib "classes.ss" "games" "cards")
         (lib "class.ss"))
(define *t* (make-object table% "Golly" 5 5))
(define *d* (make-deck))
(define *r* (make-region 0 0 1000 1000 "A Region" #f))

(send *t* add-cards-to-region *d* *r*)
(send
 *t*
 set-double-click-action
 (lambda (card)
   (printf "Double-clicked ~s~%" card)))

(send *t* show #t)
)
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the above code in a file, and execute it.  You should see a small window with some cards.  Double-click any card; nothing will appear to happen.  But I'd expect to see a message that says "Double-clicked".
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 27 Jul 2006 12:41:01 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. Changes to addres PR 8040 had
broken double-click handling.

Thanks,
