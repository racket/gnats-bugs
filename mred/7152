>Description:
The editor-stream-out put method accepts bytes in two different
ways. One way only accepts bytes that do not have a zero byte
in them, so it isn't useful in general. The other way requires
you to pass along what it claims to be the number of the bytes
you want to save. In fact, you have to pass along a number
one larger than the number of bytes you want to save.

I believe that these two methods should go away and they
should be replaced by this one:

  (send an-editor-stream-out put b n)
    b : byte string
    n : number or false = #f

  Writes the byte string b to the stream. If n is a number,
  only that many bytes are written to the stream. Otherwise,
  all of the bytes are written to the stream.

(This method should not require the +1 if n is used.)

 I experimented with something like this, but I concluded that it would
 be difficult to change all of our code to read both old and new
 streams. I don't think anyone is relying on the way that `put' stopped
 at a nul byte, and that's possible to change (thought I didn't see it
 at first). Otherwise, considering that this is an obscure corner of the
 system, I'd rather have more confidence in the old code instead of a
 nicer interface for new code.
 
 So I added `get-unterminated-bytes' to editor-stream-in%, and I changed
 `put' so that the length defaults to the string length plus one
 (instead of stopping at a nul byte).
 
 The docs for `get-unterminated-bytes', `get-bytes', and `put' explain
 how to properly match uses of `put' with uses of `get-bytes' and
 `get-unterminated-bytes'. As a result, you can pass the number of bytes
 that you want to `put', and then use `get-unterminated-bytes' to read.
 If you don't pass the number of bytes to `put', you should read with
 `get-bytes'.
 
 I've only just tagged the change to `put', but `get-unterminated-bytes'
 was in the original v299.26.
