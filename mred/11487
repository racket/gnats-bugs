>Description:
When I enter ")" and the left paren is flashed, it
happens in a red color that makes it look like
something went wrong.  It might be a by-product of
my gnome theme (eg, the splash progress bar is also
red), so it looks like there is no specific color
being set for the flash (and if there isn't, then
this is a request for adding one for these flashes).

 I should have noticed that this is the same color that I get for
 highlighting the text selection -- so this is either that feature
 request (for the framework code that does that flashing), probably.
