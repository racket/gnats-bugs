 The mred:text-window% class is full of bugs. It's going away in
 version 54.
 
 Try using mred:media-multi-text%, instead. The interface is a bit
 different, but it's actually far more powerful because you can get at
 the underlying mred:media-edit% instance that controls the text.
 
 Don't leave out the `media' - mred:multi-text%, like
 mred:text-window%, is buggy. In version 54, mred:multi-text% will be
 replaced with mred:media-multi-text%.
 
 You can also create an editor by instantiating mred:media-canvas% and
 mred:media-edit% directly.  A media-canvas is a window for holding a
 text buffer. A media-edit implements the buffer.
 
 Version 54 will be a lot cleaner (probably with better names for
 things like `media-edit'). Meanwhile, sorry for the mess.
