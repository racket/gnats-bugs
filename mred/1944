>Description:
In mred, editor<%>s and editor-canvas%es play the role of model and view
with a separataion that allows a single editor<%> to appear in
multiple editor-canvas%s with a each update to a editor<%> properly
being displayed in multiple editor-canvas%s.

editor-snip%s also play the role of a view for editor<%>s, just like
editor-canvas%es do. Sadly, editor-snip%s do not allow more than one
view for each editor<%> (I'm not sure what they actually do -- AFAICT,
they just silently do something "reasonable" without allowing multiple
views).

I would like to see this changed so that editor-snip%s really only act
as a view and allow multiple views of each editor<%>.

Unfortunately, this change is not feasible within the current editor
architecture (which is why it's not implemented that way already).
