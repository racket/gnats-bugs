>Description:
From what I can tell, set-tabs should set an
edit-sequence, since it is lots more efficient when
one is on. either that, or perhaps something 
should be mentioned in the manual. The code below
runs in 300 msec without the edit sequence and in 0
msec with it.

I'm just going to put in an edit sequence into drscheme
for now, but it would be nice to see that done automatically
or explained in the docs.

Of course, I start to wonder: are there other such methods?

 Whoops. It takes the same time, but it takes it when the edit sequence 
 ends, just like it is supposed to. Sorry!
 
 Still, this is one of the biggest single time units I can currently 
 identify in opening a window in drscheme (I've fixed 3 or 4 other 
 places now). It's 400 msec out of 1400 msec (both with gc time 
 subtracted out) for opening plt/collects/drscheme/private/rep.ss.

 Does it help to swap the `set-tabs' and `load-file'? If so, can
 DrScheme use the swapped order?
 
 (Setting tabs requires processing the entire content of an editor.)

 I just re-investigated this, and Matthew is right (from back in 2003)
 that switching the `load-file' and `set-tabs' calls saves substantial
 time (about 25% on my machine).
 
 I'm going to close the bug, as there never was a bug in the first
 place, here.  But maybe this is still useful for DrRacket.

 DrRacket seems to call set-tabs only when switching modes, not when
 loading the file.
