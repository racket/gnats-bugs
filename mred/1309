I get a message that drscheme is unable to open an output file

  version 101 (I had no trouble using version 100).

State-Changed-Why:

Sorry for the delay in responding to this error!

This seems to be a problem with the interaction between drscheme and the
shell. I have had the same problem occasionally myself, under redhat linux
6.0.  Which version are you running, and are you running under the standard
kde setup? 

I found one workaround. When that error appears, start a new shell and
restart drscheme from that shell. Then, it should work.

I believe this is a problem between mred and the shell. It may be a bug in
the shell.... I have had this problem on matthias's vaio which runs redhat
6.0.

 I wouldn't say that it has any radical new features, no. Here is the
 relevant part of the HISTORY file:
 
  - The teaching libraries are now called teachpacks. See the teachpack
    release notes for more information.
 
  - DrScheme's languages have changed (again). The langauges are now:
 
    - Beginning Student
    - Intermediate Student
    - Advanced Student
    - Full Scheme, which contains:
      - Graphical Full Scheme (with and without debugging), and
      - Textual Full Scheme (with and without debugging)
 
  - Help Desk now supports bug report submissions. Please use it in
    favor of the web based form. To submit a bug, follow the "Sumbit a
    Bug" link near the bottom of Help Desk's front page
 
  - On European keyboards, the backslash character
    may not work properly in DrScheme.  If you 
    experience this problem, comment out this line:
 
         (map-meta "\\" "remove-space")
 
    in PLTHOME/collects/framework/keymap.ss.
 
  - For tools, invoke-library is now called invoke-teachpack.
 
  - Renamed two files in the graphics collection:
     graphic.ss is now graphics.ss
     graphics.ss is now graphicss.ss
 
  - DrScheme's print menu now inserts the time, date and filename in the
    header of the file to be printed.
 
  - comment/uncomment is improved. Now, it blindly adds a semicolon to
 the 
    front of each line (and doesn't add extra semicolons on following lines)
    and aways removes one semicolon (if present) from the front of each line.
 
  - Parenthesis highlighting now turns unmatched parens red
    in addition to turning matched parenthesis regions grey.
    Also (now that the caret flashes) if the caret is between two
    parens, both before and after parens will be highlighted,
    not just the ones before.
    
    Thus, every time the cursor is next to an uncommented
    paren, the programmer sees some feedback about the paren.
