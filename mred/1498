>Description:
I took a copy of the unix sources (from one of the
european mirrors) to my home machine 
for compiling. I have debian at home (release 2.1 it
says on the CD). There was a hiccup when compiling MrEd
it complained of two ambiguous calls to overloaded
functions.  Well we didn't have these sort of things
in my day :) so I took a guess at removing what seemed
to be redundant declarations and that seems to have 
fixed it.  Here are the diffs and a note of the
compiler:

bash-2.01$ diff wxs_madm.cxx*
3643c3643
<   /*  extern Scheme_Object *objscheme_bundle_wxKeyEvent(wxKeyEvent *);*/
---
>   extern Scheme_Object *objscheme_bundle_wxKeyEvent(wxKeyEvent *);
3659c3659
<   /*  extern Scheme_Object *objscheme_bundle_wxMouseEvent(wxMouseEvent *);*/
---
>   extern Scheme_Object *objscheme_bundle_wxMouseEvent(wxMouseEvent *);
bash-2.01$ gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2.3/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.3

>How-To-Repeat:
cd mred
make
:)

If you want more info about the environment let me know but it's not
connected to the net so something that fits on a floppy would be OK.
