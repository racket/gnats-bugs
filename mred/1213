>Description:
The drop-down lists for Choose Language | Language

the text of the options is truncated.  

When the lists are dropped, the full text appears,
but is again truncated when the list is retracted.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Choose Language | Language, scroll to "Intermediate Student".
It appears as "Intermediat".

In Preferences | Category, scroll to "Check Syntax".  It appears
as "Che".
