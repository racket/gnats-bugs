>Description:
First of all, I really appreciate your efforts to provide DrScheme including the slideshow. I enjoy it a lot. However, I have one request:

While using the slideshow, I often want to produce postscripts as outputs. Especially, I want to run the slideshow as a batch mode, so I don't need to run my x-winidows. My situation is as follows: I remotely access my server on which I installed DrScheme, write slides with emacs and then *want*to* produce a ps file from it, so I can download/distribute it. It is true that I can run DrScheme on my desktop or run cygwin x-server, but is it necessary to run the slideshow on X-mode even though I don't require any graphical features?

Thanks,
Wonseok

 Ho woonsock: as it turns out, the slideshow library does require the
 graphics system (our libraries are structured so that all of the
 graphics stuff requires an X connection, even to get started. I'm not
 sure we could tease out just enough to get slideshow working without
 it. It may not even be possible, I'm not sure.)
 
 In any case, you might try using vnc. You can create an X server that
 you just don't look at with it and then point slideshow at it.
 
 hth,
 Robby
