>Description:
MrEd may crash when an iconified window's eventspace's custodian
is shutdown. The window never goes away, even when it is de-iconified.

I am using fvwm95 as my window manager
>How-To-Repeat:
;; evaluate:

(define c (make-custodian))
(define f
  (parameterize ([current-custodian c]
		 [current-eventspace (make-eventspace)])
    (let ([f (make-object frame% "test" #f 100 100)])
      (make-object menu-item% "item" (make-object menu% "menu" (make-object menu-bar% f)) void)
      (send f show #t)
      f)))

;; iconify the window f, and evaluate:

(custodian-shutdown-all c)

;; uniconify the window, mred may crash even before this point.
;; If not, the window survives (but the menubar is not redrawn)

 I tried reproducing the bug using the default fvwm95 configuration for
 the root user in RedHat 5.0. The window's icon was removed from the
 task bar when I issued the shut down command, so there was no
 opportunity for a crash.
 
 If the icon stays aroung when a frame is sent show #f (or when the
 custodian shuts a frame down), then the window manager must be ignoring
 MrEd's XWithdrawWindow() call. As far as I know, there's nothing I can
 do about that.
 
 Minor Caveat: MrEd doesn't call XWithdrawWindow() if a window has been
 shown for less than one second. This avoids a bug in ctwm that I
 haven't taken the time to track down. (The theory is that the user
 hasn't had time to iconize the window, anyway.) From the How-To-Repeat
 that you sent, I gather that this MrEd hack isn't the problem. (Still,
 I'll try check for ctwm updates and/or send mail to the author soon so
 I can get rid of MrEd's hack.)

 Are you sure that you aren't running fvwm, instead of fvwm95? I
 believe that fvwm is the default for the root, not fvwm95.

 Actually, when I reproduced this bug, I was hiding the window quickly.
 In the original drsheme interaction, I was not hiding the window correctly.
 
 To reproduce, try my .fvwm95rc from cs. It reproduces very nicely.
 Also, I should say that fvwm95 is not a very nice window manager and
 is not getting a lot of work done on it.
 
 I will try to see if I can get xemacs to exhibit the same behavior. If
 not, I will try to find what they do.

 Oh, right. I always get them confused because the fvwm2 setup looks
 like Windows 95.
 
 Since I don't already have fvwm95 locally, I'll wait until I get back
 to Houston to look at it.

 Unfortunately, I think that you will have to compile your own. I think
 that I got mine from www.fvwm.org (and followed a link to the fvwm95
 homepage).
