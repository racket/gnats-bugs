>Description:
sometimes DrScheme will freeze on Windows XP when the Help-Desk is also open.  Hitting a link or doing a new search in the help-desk unfreezes all open drscheme windows.  I'm using Opera 6.01, and maybe it's not closing its connection with the web-server, but it seems something is blocking there...
Also, the other drscheme windows shouldn't freeze when one is blocking.

 That's really bad. It suggests that a non-blocking TCP operation is
 blocking.
 
 Looks like it's time to bite the bullet and install XP.
