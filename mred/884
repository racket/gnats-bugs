 A return is consumed by the frame. See on-traverse-char.
 
 To be honest, I'm now not sure why I made the return key consumed, even
 when there's no border button. I had a reason, and I'll try to remember
 it.

 I didn't even know about that method! How is it called? Should the test suite be
 calling it? Does it come before or after on-subwindow-char? Does
 on-subwindow-char call it or is on-subwindow-char called by it or are they both
 called by something else?
 
 PS: the documentation for button%'s style-list argument has the wrong type.
 
 Also, there should probably be a link from the button% initialization description
 to on-traverse-char. PRobably links from other places too, but I am not sure
 where, since I don't know how this method is used yet.

 I really should have pointed you to on-subwindow-char in frame%, but I
 was afraid that you wouldn't follow the link to on-traverse-char.

 Presumably, you've looked at the docs for frame%'s on-subwindow-char by
 now, so you know that it calls on-traverse-char. I'll put a link in
 on-traverse-char going back to on-subwindow-char. I have already put a
 note in window%'s on-subwindow-char warning about the default method in
 frame% and dialog% (but I haven't committed or rebuilt the docs, yet).
