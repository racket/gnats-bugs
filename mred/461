>Description:
	In the Default Fonts section of the Preferences dialog, each
font type has some text to the right. All of the text changes size
interactively as the slider at the bottom is adjusted (and it looks
cool), but all of the text is in the same font. For example, the
layout suggests that the text in the "Modern" line is supposed to be
in the Modern font, but it isn't.
