>Description:
The search results when clicking on an unbound id
differ from those when the same id is entered 
into Help Desk directly
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrScheme, enter xml in the Interactions window.
Click on the xml link that is generated within the
error message.  Help Desk says nothing found.

Now enter xml on the search line in Help Desk.
Lots of results in this case.
