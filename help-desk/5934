 If your browser is setup to use a proxy server, 
 change your settings to ignore the proxy for 
 the address "127.0.0.1".
 
 Does that help?

 thanks for the quick reply.
 
 Is there another way around this ?
 
 I use an automatic script that chooses the proxy,
 I don't even know the IP address of the proxy,
 so I don't know how to exclude and IP address.
  
 anyway i think that my institution forces me to go through that proxy
 out to the internet.
 
 Haim.
