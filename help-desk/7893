 The program in the PR doesn't seem to signal an error.
 
 I did notice and fix a bug. It may even have been the right one. Let me
 know if you still see the problem.

 PR 7893, of course. The one where you sent a program with an error. It
 didn't cause an error for me.

 There was no subject line and I didn't have time to look it up.
 
 Did you evaluate "new Example()"? The error is this: a strange
 error shows up; the tail-rec arrow is drawn, pointing from Example's
 constructor to the constructor of BlockWorld; I highlight everything;
 I press F1 and Help Desk thinks it needs to look up all of this,
 including the arrow. ERROR.
 
 WARNING: I wrote a two line Scheme program that does the arrow et al
 BUT it didn't trigger the problem in my drscheme. In ProfessorJ's
 high-lighted buffer it was repeatable (three times).

 I did. I got an Example object out instead of an error.

 The arrows were purple, and not red? That's another bug then, I guess.
 I haven't seen that before.

 Well, like I say, I found a probable bug fix. Let me know if you see
 the problem in the current version.

 I even tried sticking a "null" into the program to get an error, and I
 did get an error, but still select-all followed by f1 didn't cause a
 problem (in either the defs or in the ints).

 Kathy fixed the error. Is it possible you updated afterwards?

 I didn't update between receiving the PR and trying the code, but I had
 earlier today.

 Hah, I can't reconstruct it on my home machine either. Sorry but it's 
 nearly identical in set up (I tend to svn and compile from source at 
 the same time).

 Well, I'm mildly optimistic that I fixed the bug. I fixed something
 that could possibly have led to that, so if I didn't fix the bug you
 found, I fixed a related one. :)

 Must be something else, then. Maybe there's some state somewhere, or
 maybe you have a typo in the file that triggered something -- a % in a
 comment could have been the culprit ... maybe.
