>Description:
When I search for "path" in the locally-installed documentation for 5.0.1.7, the only exact match that shows up is the type "Path" from typed/racket.  However, if I scroll through the results, I eventually find results for the library "Path" in unstable, the environment variable "PATH" in reference, and the technical term "path" in reference.  I don't know why these don't show up as "exact matches".

 There's a preference for exact matches for exact match for a binding
 name.  Everything else is shown in order.

 Where do I set that preference, and if I set it differently, what will happ=

 It's not a user setting, it's the JS code that prefers bindings over
 everything else.
 
 (And to repeat it yet again: the code searches through all entries and
 adds them to one of two vectors -- the preferred one for exact binding
 matches and the rest, then appends the two results.  It's not a good
 way to add more intermediate preference levels like a match over a
 non-binding, or making word matches come first etc -- but it keeps the
 search fast enough.)

 Okay -- in that case, I would like the word "exact" to be replaced
 with something that means "exact binding", although it probably needs
 to be longer than that so users know what is meant by "binding" here
 (that is, something defined in Racket, and not a technical term,
 environment variable, command-line flag, etc.).  When I see "(1
 exact)" and no mention of the "path" datatype, it leads me to believe
 there is no documentation for the "path" datatype under that name.
 That, or change the behavior to catch all exact matches, not just
 bindings.  Just so long as what it says it lists, and what it lists,
 are in sync.

 The file you want is:
 
   collects/scribblings/main/private/search.js
 
 you can play with it live at
 
   doc/search/search.js
 
 in your installation.  If you want to do the former, then this is the
 code that you need to change:
 
   exact = (exact <= 0) ? ''
           : ' (<span style="background-color: '+highlight_color+';">'
             + ((exact == results_num) ? 'all' : exact)
             + ' exact</span>)';
 
 and if you want to do the latter, then look into the `Search'
 function.
