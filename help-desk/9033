>Description:
I have installed the ubuntu "gutsy gibbon" i386 linux distribution, apt-get installed drscheme, opened the help desk and searched for "set-pixel".

There was a search result containing the search query, and when I clicked on the corresponding hyperlink to read the documentation for "set-pixel", drscheme asked me wether I wanted to view the online documentation that contained this function, or if it should download and install the missing documentation.
I chose to download and install the missing documentation. The download & installation process terminated successfully, but after clicking on the search results again, the plt webserver sends an error page stating that the requested document could not be found.

 When you say that the download/install process terminated
 successfully, how are you measuring that? Did you see the files get
 installed?
 
 Do you have a transcript from the installation window?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

	documentation failed

 The dialogs contained a list of installed files, which are actually on my system.
 
 So I concluded that the files were successfully downloaded unpacked and moved to (what seems) the
 correct directory.
 
 I think I found the cause of the unexpected behavior; after restarting drscheme the documentation could be found.
 So maybe the builtin webserver should be restarted after installation of documentation?
 Alternatively a message could be presented to the user, stating that drscheme needs to be restarted.
 
 with best regards,
   Sven
