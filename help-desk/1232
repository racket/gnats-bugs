>Description:
When I type in "url" one of the entries is

  In net collection
    url in doc.txt

When I click on this, or the entries below it, I get an error saying
Help Desk is trying to open the file

  /home/scheme/plt/collects/net/doc.txt/doc.txt

which, of course, doesn't exist.

I'm classifying this as a s/w rather than doc bug since it seems the
bug is in the Help Desk software.
