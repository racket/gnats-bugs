>Description:
The font size preference setting does not affect the
(internal) help desk browser window, and the default
font size is awfully small.  (On my system, the
letters in the subheadings on the main screen are
all of 6 pixels high.)

 If you set the regular drscheme font size to its default, is it
 correspondingly small?
 
 (in other words, do we need to adjust some font's default size in
 addition?)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Lo, on Thursday, April 3, Robby Findler did write:

 Yes, DrScheme's default fonts for the interactions & definitions window
 are similarly tiny, but I don't think the default size matters for that
 very much: it's easily configurable.
