>Description:
The figure containing the syntax for plt-match is so
badly formatted as to be illegible: the columns don't
line up at all.  (MzLib docs refreshed 5 minutes ago.)

Oddly enough, cutting and pasting the text into 
another window (e.g., emacs, or this submission form)
window gets the columns aligned correctly, so I can't
include a sample.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open help-desk; visit the PLT-MATCH section of the
MzLib manual.

 Make your window wider.

 Does it make sense to have the browser create an embedded editor (with
 wrapping disabled) to render tabulars into, to be sure they don't wrap?
 (as a solution to this problem Richard noticed?)

 Lo, on Thursday, November 27, Robby Findler did write:

 A) It's already full screen.  My eyes can't take anything higher than
    1024x768 on a 15" monitor, with a relatively large font.
 
 B) I don't think it's an issue of the text wrapping.  The right column
    (i.e., the English) appears to be centered, which is odd.

 It's wrapping.
