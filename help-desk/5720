 I think only a very few parts of the old Help Desk used the language
 setting.  The help text itself was/is in English.
 
 It would be easy enough to have bits like the search frame in the
 language of choice.  Are there other parts that would be useful to have
 translated?

 I've added back as many of those as I can, and added a few new ones,
 which will have to be translated.

 OK, this is a bit more than I have time for today!
 
 We'll keep the PR open so this request remains accessible.

 Here is a wish list :-)
 
 1.
 Personally, I would like to translate the manuals for
 the beginner, beginner with lambda etc language manuals.
 This should be doable in a short time.
 
 2.
 Translations of the error messages in the REPL in the
 teaching laguages would also be very nice (but
 difficult to achieve?)
 
 3.
 Around christmas I translated the R5RS to danish, it only
 lack the final proof reading. I didn't need until now
 (I had my first class yesterday), so it has been on hold for a
 while. I must admit that it took considerable longer
 time than I anticipated. When (and if) I finish,
 it would be nice to have included in the search, if the
 chosen language is danish.
 
 
 Another thing: For small screens it is somewaht important that
 the upper part of the search page are kept small. I therefore propose
 to move the configure help desk link to the fra right, since it is
 seldom
 used. That way the bar can be move up a bit.
