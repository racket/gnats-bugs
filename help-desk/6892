 This is not the Orbitz bug.  The Orbitz bug would be if you switched
 back to the first (L1) window and got help sensitive to the second
 (L2).  This is something much stranger.

 This isn't the orbitz problem -- the help desk window is a standalone
 entity. It has it's own state, separate from the drscheme window. The
 orbitz bug is because the windows *dont* have their own state....
 
 Anyways, if you can suggest some mechanism to control how help desk
 decides which language's manuals to search, I'd be glad to add it in.
 Right now, it's state associated with the help desk frame itself (and
 has to be changed by choosing the language menu on the help desk
 frame).

 I know how to change it.
 
 I would like Help Desk to pick up the language from the frame
 was top-most when I launched it. If it is launched independently,
 you can either choose the language level from the mred prefs or
 always start with module.

 Okay, this is what already happens, where "launched" means "first
 opened". If you mean by launched "ever time it comes to the front",
 then I think that's a bad idea. Imagine this sequence of operations:
 
   - I'm reading some page in Help Desk on an advanced feature of MrEd
     as I'm developing a teachpack ... blah blah blah ...
 
   - .... in comes some email. I click over to Mail and read it.
 
   - okay, back to help desk -- except I click first on a different
     drscheme window (one set in the beginner language, say, where I'm
     testing the teachpack)
 
   - no problem. I click on my help desk window to bring it to the front
     (I hit f10 or something)
 
   - now I search. Oops! Nothing found! Why not? did I mis-type it?
     let me double check. No... hm. must be a bug. better submit a bug report.
 
 It's a bit too close to the border of "too smart" for my taste, but
 maybe that kind of interaction seems rare to you?

 Here's what I just did:
 
   - start drscheme (in "module" language)
   - open help desk. it too is in the module language.
 
 What were you expecting?

 That's not the bug I reported and now that I tried to reconstruct it
 at the office, I am beginning to think it's an Orbitz'y bug.
 
 Open a drscheme. It's in language Lan1.
 Create new window. Change to language Lan2.
 Go back to window 1. Open HelpDesk. It's in Lan2.

 Perhaps we need a better way of letting people know where
 things were *not* found. Specifically if you type in
 namespace in a "beginner" help desk, the response should
 be
 
   "Nothing found for namespace in `Beginner Scheme'".
 
 You may even want to link the name of the language to
 the language choice menu.

 When you say "open HelpDesk" are you really opening a new window, or
 just bringing the old one to the front?

 It's not possible to open a new help desk window as you suggest.
 DrScheme just doesn't do that. You have to be in a help desk window to
 get a second help desk window.

 I didn't get a second one. I never said I did. I had two DrScheme 
 windows and one help desk window.

 I don't know why we're miscommunicating so badly here. The one help 
 desk window has it's own state of what language you're searching in. 
 That's what I've been saying all along.
 
 If you want to change the language, use the language menu.

 It has the wrong state when it gets invoked. That's all I am saying.

 You seem to be confusing "invoked" with "brought to the front".
 
 As we've agreed, there is only a single Help Desk window. Thus, it was 
 only created once. Thus it only has a single state (initialized when it 
 was created). If you want to change the state, you have to do it 
 yourself.
 
 I think I explained why implicitly changing the state wouldn't be a 
 good idea, but you don't seem to be disputing that. Am I 
 misunderstangin?

 Summary from phone call: I'll add something so that "f1" (and
 right-click) based searches change the language level and so that each
 Help Desk window gets its initial language from the DrScheme window
 where it was created, rather than from the current value of the
 preferences (if a Help Desk is created without a DrScheme window
 around, it will just use the prefs as it currently does).
