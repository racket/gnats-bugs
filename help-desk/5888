 After launching Help Desk, what happens if you manually set IE to 
 go to
 
   http://127.0.0.1/servlets/home.ss

 Do you have IE setup to use a proxy server?
 
 If so, try configuring it to not use the proxy for
 the IP address "127.0.0.1".

 Perhaps you have IE setup to use a proxy server.
 
 In that case, set IE to ignore the address "127.0.0.1" for the proxy.

 I receive a "Page cannot be displayed error"
 However, after setting Netscape as the default browser, the problem went
 away (?!).
