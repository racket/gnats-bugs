 There have been some recent changes in Help Desk (we've found a few
 bugs there ourselves ...). Can you say more precisely what steps you
 took to get to the 404 error so I can be sure exactly what's going on?

 Absolutely, it is! Thanks.

 Sure; I should have done that in the report.
 
 Starting with a "fresh" Help Desk:
 
 1. Click on "Manuals"
 2. Scroll down to "Uninstalled Manuals"
 3. Click on "PLT Framework: GUI Application Framework"
 4. Read message:
 
 Downloading PLT Foreign Interface Manual...
 error response from server "404 Not Found"
 Finished.
 
 5. Repeat for all other manuals.
 
 I do not appear to be running any firewall software, nor is the OS X 
 firewall enabled. No proxies are running. Granted, I'm on a dodgy USB 
 ADSL modem, and currently find myself at the westernmost point in 
 Europe... but that doesn't seem like it should matter. (At least, I 
 think the little tip of Portugal is the westernmost point...)
 
 HTTP(S), IMAP (+SSL), and Skype/IM apps all seem to be working fine, so 
 this is perhaps some other oddity?
 
 Let me know if I can help dig deeper if necessary.
 
 Cheers,
 Matt

 The problem that Matt describes is my fault -- since I didn't go over
 the release checklist as usual, I forgot to put the missing *-doc.plt
 files in the expected place.  I did this now, and installing missing
 manuals should work fine (I tried it too).
 
 But there seem to be another problem open -- when I search for a
 missing entry and click it, instead of the usual screen (not
 installed, you can view it on-line or install), I get a screen that
 says
 
   The file you were looking for was not found on the Help Desk server.
 
   Help Desk home 
 
   Powered by [X].
 
 Also, the image in the above is missing -- its that crossed box thing.

 This was supposed to be caught on line 125 of "gui.ss". I tested this
 sort of thing when I touched the code, but maybe I tested it wrong, or
 maybe it's just fragile.
 
 (Another thing I tried was removing the MzScheme manual and following a
 link from the MrEd manual to the MzScheme manual.)

 Looks like I messed this up.

 That's fixed now, checked into SVN. I introduced that bug when I added
 planet as a new doc root.

Reason>>> I verified that it is ok to both install, and look at
missing documentation.
