>Description:
Context: I'm running SuSE 8.0 and DrScheme v201.  This problem didn't exist with v200 on the same OS, and the problem doesn't exist on my Dell Latitude notebook, where I have DrScheme v201 working well under RedHat Linux 7.3 

The problem:  Clicking on Help, then on Netscape in the "Choose a Browser" menu, there is no effect.  "None" stays selected.  

When this menu is closed, the next dialog reports:  "open url:  Couldn't find [the list of browsers] to open URL:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/home.ss"

Selecting "Browsers" under "Preferences" in the Edit menu produces a list of browsers, but none of them can be selected.  They are all frozen, just as in the
previous "Choose a Browser" menu, and the "None" button stays selected.


>How-To-Repeat:
Please see above.

I can access the Help Desk by doing the following:  with DrScheme running, I click on Help, then go to another desktop with Netscape up and running, and I enter the above URL, and the Help Desk comes up under Netscape.  (If I close DrScheme, the URL can no longer be accessed.)  Then I return to DrScheme and close the "Choose a Browser" menu and the "open url ...." error message.

 Is one of the browsers in your PATH?

 In that case, try extending your PATH to include 
 Netscape or some other browser.  Use the `which'
 command to verify this change.
 
  which netscape
 
 (or other browser name) should tell you if the 
 browser's in your PATH.
