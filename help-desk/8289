 What I see when I search seems like exactly what I expected to see, so
 perhaps you should tell us what you see and what you had hoped for.

 We saw (in class) scrambled text like
 
   sqrsqrsqr (num->num)(num->num) etc.
 
 That's in the "delivered" version (352, released).

 Oh, I see that in the full text search.
 
 And the other?

 Dale mentioned full text search and keyword and index search? I guess
 he expected "sqr" to come up? Perhaps he's asking for more indexing in
 the teaching language manuals?

 Yes, that's correct.  A search on square ought to provide results for  
 sqr and sqrt.  While I'm at it, searching for `power' or `exponent'  
 ought to give back results for exp and expt.  Finally, I think that  
 searching for `round' should produce links for round, floor, and  
 ceiling.  Students had a little bit of trouble finding those in my  
 first lab.  -Dale

 If you'd like to help out (which would be great!) that sounds like
 something you might try to tackle yourself ... Matthias knows where the
 docs sources are, I believe, and probably is the last one to have
 worked on that code.
