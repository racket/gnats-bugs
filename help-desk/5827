>Description:
I recently installed Edi Berziley's Swindle package.
It is now listed in installed components
but searching for "swindle" yielded no result
(not even if I search all text).
However, I think it is reasonable to expect
add-on to be keyword searchable.

Regards
Ulf

>How-To-Repeat:
install "swindle.plt"

 Add-ons are searchable, if they provide the right files.
 
 What does swindle provide in the way of documentation?  Help Desk can
 find documentation either in the `doc' collection, if there's an hdindex
 and/or keyword file, or in a doc.txt file in the collection itself, with
 `>' used to flag search terms.

 That should have worked, and it certainly works for me...
 
 For reference, the doc.txt file is accessible at
   http://www.cs.cornell.edu/eli/Swindle/swindle/doc.txt

 Full-text search should be a last resort.
 
 I think that the doc.txt needs to have something like
 
  _swindle_
 
 added so that Help Desk can find that keyword.

 Ulf -- are you using the latest version?  There is definitely a line
 with "_swindle_ _swindle.ss_" near the bottom.

 I will add a lowercase _swindle_ there, anyway... -- there is
 something else fishy there.  When I was checking this, I saw that
 searching for all _keywords_ in the file do not take the browser to
 the correct point, in any of the doc.txt files -- the link name is
 always something like `foo in "indexed content"' and there is no
 `offset' part in the URL as with the >keywords.

 I think that's by design.  I think the _foo_ entries are used just to
 denote the file, not an offset within the file.

 hi all
 
 i think the issue is solved now.
 i simply reinstalled the package
 and now even plain keyword search
 return one link to the doc file.
 there is even a link "swindle home" in the help menu.
 
 i tried to recall what could have been the reason:
 i first installed the package at the command line
 using "Setup PLT.exe" directly.
 for the reinstallation i used the
 "Install .plt File" button within plt.
 probably that made the difference.
 
 thank you all for the kind help,
 and sorry for having bugged you some much about this
 seemingly minor issue!
 
 **
 
 now if i was to suggest some minor imrovement of this mechanism:
 remove the "options" part from the search:
 if there are *keywords* present it schould return something like
 "the following keywords where found" followed by the links,
 then
 "indexed content:" followed by the links
 and at the end
 "click here to search for full text search" --
 i think this reflects the way one uses a search mechanism.
 otherwise:
 if no keywords and index words exist,
 the search could go for full text right away,
 showing a message like
 "no keywords or index entries found. searching full text."
 so that one knows what's happening
 (with a break option allowing to watch the results found so far).
 
 another idea:
 i saw that with search,
 there are alway links to all kinds of "student languages" before r5rs 
 and mz stuff.
 now, i am using "pretty big", so i think result presentation could just 
 start with r5rs.
 this is, of course, an issue for plt as an IDE for software production
 rather than just teaching.
 
 remark no. 3
 the "install .plt file" has two tabs: file and url.
 both ask you for a line of text specifying the place of the .plt.
 however, it obviously does not work to install from file using url (e.g. 
 "file:// ...").
 on the other hand, "file" doesn't open this typical "file chooser window".
 i think, though, this would be the more sensible differentiation:
 either plain text line (http:// or file:// never mind) or chooser window.
 
 bye

 Ah, I didn't realize that -- it's not in the help/doc.txt description.
 Maybe it would make sense to add another thing that will jump to the
 place it is mentioned -- this way you can have "sections" in the doc
 file with meaningful names you can search.
 
 [BTW, are there any plans to allow html documentation in collection
 directories?]

 That shouldn't make a difference, since the "Install" button simply
 calls "Setup PLT.exe".

 Not a problem.

 I've just added, or more accurately, restored a feature in Help Desk:
 keywords in result links are bold-faced.  That way, you can distinguish
 entries that have keywords from index entries.
 
 I'm not sure that automatically switching to full-text searches is a
 good idea, because they can take quite a long time.

 The file plt/collects/help/private/docpos.ss contains the order of
 manuals -- that can be edited as desired.

 OK, I'll mention that to Robby Findler, who maintains DrScheme.
 
 Thanks for all your comments.

 The problem may have been that Help Desk was not reloaded after
 installing the file.  I think Help Desk caches information during a
 session.
