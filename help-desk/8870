Fresh checkout (r7095), build, and install.  After manuals failed to install (see my last bug), I tried to look at the HtDC teachpack documentation within help desk.  Clicking on the "How to Design Classes" link gives me the "Documentation missing" page, as I'd expect.  Clicking on the "PLT's servers" link, which is supposed to refer me to the web copy, fails to work.  I get an error dialog box reading

    run-browser: process execute failed: ("open \"#<struct:url>\"")

and a Standard Output window containing the text

    2007-08-13 21:21:52.225 open[28297] No such file: /#<struct:url>
    run-browser: process execute failed: ("open \"#<struct:url>\"")

Restarting DrScheme and trying again produced same results.

 What's the value of `external-browser' in your plt-preferences file?

 I'm not sure which file you're referring to.  However,
 $HOME/Library/Preferences/org.plt-scheme.prefs.ss contains the following
 line:
 
  (plt:framework-pref:external-browser #f)
 
 There are no other occurrences of "external-browser" in that file, or in
 either of the other two org.plt-scheme.* files in that directory.

 That's what I wanted to know, to be sure that you have the default
 setting.  Back to the problem you've seen -- it looks like a url
 struct is passed on to `send-url', instead of a url string.  There are
 a number of places that send a value to that procedure, but none of
 them look fishy.  Can you tell me the exact sequence of operations
 that got you to the error?

 To sendurl??  That whole thing needs a major overhaul.  I'm almost a
 tourist in the mess of processes and platform-dependent features.
 Because of that I'm not happy to do any modifications to it that I'm
 not completelt sure about...

 Oh, and BTW, the problem is almost certainly coming through
 "collects/browser/external.ss" -- which I barely touched.

 That has nothing to do with adding a contract.
 
 Anyways, I thought you were looking into this, from the email transcript.
 
 I'll do it.

 * IIUC, adding a contract to "net/sendurl.ss" would just blame
   "browser/external.ss", which doesn't help in finiding the problem.
 
 * Adding contracts to the latter might be better then.
 
 * I will be happy if you add the contracts -- even more if you find
   the bug...  (I couldn't get it to happen yet.)

 Well, I can't seem to make this happen, under mac os x. This looks to
 be the platform Richard was using.
 
 I didn't try the same manual, but I deleted everything in
 plt/doc/mzscheme/ except the hdindex and keywords files, searched for
 case-lambda, and followed the link to the mzscheme, served online. It
 worked.
 
 This was, I believe the same page that Richard go to, but or the mz
 maual instead of the profj teachpacks manual.
 
 So I'm not sure how to reproduce the problem.
 
 Richard: any hints? Can you try the above and let me know if that fails for you?

 Yes, now that I see the code the error message is confusing. It says
 that run-browser is identifying a problem, but that's an internal
 helper function from the point of view of the send-url user. Sorry
 about that.

 I wouldn't be surprised if `add-link' is the pipe that leads the bad
 value in -- and that's an (uncontracted) method...

 I think I found the problem. Fix committed.
 
 One has to choose "external browser" and "don't ask again" on the
 dialog you get when visiting an external url in order to trigger the
 bug.

 0. Start DrScheme.
 1. Open Help Desk.
 2. Click "Teachpacks" link.
 3. Click "How to Design Classes" link.
 4. Get notification that docs aren't installed.
 5. Click on link to read docs on PLT's servers.
 
 Not reproducible this morning, but that's only because I was able to
 install the manuals last night.

 That fails for me also, with the same error message.
 
 If it matters, OS X is configured to use Firefox as my default browser.
 
 (If DrScheme cares what my default browser is, that's another bug, of
 course.)

 Eli, Richard: I believe I have fixed the bug. I also think I sent you
 a message to that effect. Richard replied to earlier messages, but not
 the latest and now Eli is replying to Richard's out of date replies.
 
 Can we please get in sync?
