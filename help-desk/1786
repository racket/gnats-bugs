How to use ActiveX components

If you run Windows, you can use MysterX, a library for controlling COM and ActiveX components within DrScheme, MzScheme, or MrEd. MysterX is available from http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/mysterx/.

 Robby,

 I think there's a problem using the DOCDOTTXT macro in Help Desk.
 Not only do things fail if the collection is not installed, but
 they fail if it is installed.
 
 On sun.cs, look for COM in HD, then click on "the mysterx collection"
 to see the problem.
