 Do you a dialup setup normally? If so, you might consider configuring
 your computer for some other kind of network (it doesn't matter if you
 actually have that network). That seemed to work for me. I know it is
 painful.
 
 If not, can you tell us more details about your network configuration?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I checked with John on his computer, and this seems to be a macosx
 specific bug: the accents are correctly displayed in menu entries, but
 incorrectly displayed in menu titles.

 You need to install networking support, even though you don't need an
 actual Internet connection.  Without a connection, some features will be
 missing, like bug report submission, but you'll be able to search
 documentation.
