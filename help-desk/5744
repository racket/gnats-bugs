 That's intentional, so that the search dialog isn't lost.
 
 In some browsers, like Mozilla, you can choose to make the frame take up
 the whole window.  In every browser, I think, you can open a link in a
 new window.
 
 With the no-frames option, is this an issue?

 I think that if we had the "kill frames" option in the top frame that
 would clear it up for me.
 
 Of course, that option would have to leave
 you with the bottom now taking up the whole thing rather than going
 back home. Is that possible?
