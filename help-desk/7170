>Description:
It would be easier to report documentation bugs
found by reading in the help desk if one could open
a bug report form without losing one's place in the help desk.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open the help desk in DrScheme
Browse to the Tour, look at section 10,
find a mistake, then try to report the bug by
sending a bug report.

 Hi Gary,
 
   You can create multiple instances of Help Desk, but you have to do it
 from the Help Desk's menus. Under the File menu you should find a New
 Help Desk window.
 
 hth,

Unless you have a suggestion to make it easier to find the menu? Let me 
know.

 Hi Robby,
 
 Yes, I think in the "Help" menu of the "Help Desk" you could have a
 new item which is "Send Bug Report", which would open up a window to
 do that.  It might be useful in general (also in DrScheme) to have
 that item.

 Yeah, that's a good idea. I think others have had similar problems that
 would also be served by that. 
 
 I've added the menu item to DrScheme and to Help Desk's help menu, for
 the next release (available in our CVS archives now, if you're
 interested).
