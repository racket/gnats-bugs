>Description:
Following download from Anoncvs I compiled and installed DrScheme.  Then,
I clicked Help->Help Desk and got the following message:

SOMETHING IS WRONG

CVS: Download bundle to fix it
CVS: After downloading, you must restart Help Desk (or DrScheme, if this Help Desk was started from inside DrScheme).

You got this page because the "help" subcollection of the "doc" collection wasn't found, or the file "index.html" wasn't in the subcollection.

Normally, Help Desk would start with
  /usr/local/plt/collects/doc/help/index.html
on this machine.

View installed manuals

Version: 103.5d105

I then downloaded the 300440 byte bundle as indicated, exited and restarted Dr. Scheme. Now I get the following message:

 Problem has been fixed after a post to the user group.  Sorry for
 the double post.
