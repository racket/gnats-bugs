 Eli ... I'll fix this. But in the future, you may wish to read the docs
 relating to the code you're modifying. In this particular case,
 grow-box-spacer-pane%.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 1. I assumed that a grow-box was the right thing to use, and looking
    at your fix, I didn't know where it should be used.
 
 2. The behavior on Linux is now the same, so I had no way to see a
    problem.
 
 3. The docs (for grow-box-spacer-pane%) should have been helpful, but
    if you look at the page -- it has absolutely no information.
 
 (Given #2 and #3, I still have no idea what a grow box is and
 when/where it should be used.)

 I agree that the "See pane%" link is somewhat difficult to see, and
 tere doesn't seem to be a good reason for the information to be with
 "pane%". I'll move it.

 (And now I saw that, and yes, I used it in a very wrong way.  FWIW,
 "grow-box" is a very confusing name since it makes me think that its a
 stretchable spacer thing -- I'd prefer a "resize handler" and google
 seems to agree, but it also seems like it's OSX terminology.)

 Ah -- it is a spacer for a grow-box. The grow-box is a little thingy on
 the mac in the bottom right that lets you resize the window. A spacer
 pane is a panel is just big enough to take up that space on the mac and
 0-sized on all other platforms. The idea is that you make sure it ends
 up in the bottom right corner of your window by putting it into the
 right place in the right sub-panel.

 (Yeah, I got that after some googling -- the description in pane% was
 fine, the problem is with Apple who invented their own term...)

 The grow box has been there since the beginning? Which pre-1984
 terminology do you think they should have used?
