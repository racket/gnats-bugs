>Description:
About a month ago, the "refresh all manuals" feature caused "mred"
process to grow to a huge size, causing major swapping and disk I/O
contention.  I wasn't able to file a bug report at that time, and forgot
about it.  But glancing at refresh-manuals.ss just now, I wonder if part
of the cause could've been that the read-string in download-doc
generates lots of garbage that doesn't get collected very often.

One of my current programs makes a really simple-minded use of
read-string-avail! and write-string-avail for a similar purpose (just
read a block into a buffer, keep writing from buffer until it's empty,
repeat).  I haven't evaluated this beyond observing that it's downloaded
a few thousand small (<100KB) files from Httper to disk accurately.

(define (port-copy in out)
  ;; Note: This may write lots of suboptimal block sizes.
  ;; Note: Input port closed on EOF, but output port is never closed.
  (let ((buf (make-string 1024)))
    (let do-read ()
      (let ((read-count (read-string-avail!/enable-break buf in)))
        (cond ((eof-object? read-count)
               (close-input-port in))
              ((equal? read-count 0)
               (sleep 0)
               ;; TODO: poll?
               (do-read))
              (else
               (let do-write ((start-k 0))
                 (let ((write-count (write-string-avail/enable-break
                                     buf out start-k read-count)))
                   (cond ((equal? write-count 0)
                          (sleep 0)
                          ;; TODO: poll?
                          (do-write start-k))
                         ((equal? write-count (- read-count start-k))
                          (do-read))
                         (else (do-write (+ start-k write-count))))))))))))

 JFYI, almost the exact same code implements `copy-port' in '(lib
 "thread.ss")'. Well, it was almost exactly the same until I generalized
 `copy-port' for multiple output ports.
 
 `download-doc' should certainly use `copy-port'. I'll change it.
