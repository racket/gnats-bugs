 How about this:
 
   MzScheme.exe -l- help/help
 
 and this:
 
   MrEd.exe -l- help/help

 Both seem to work fine: that is, they cause my browser to open

 Eric: can you try to see if the mred process starts when you run
 plt-help.exe?  (Something like openning the process thing, then
 hitting return repeatedly on plt-help.exe and checking if a process
 shows up?)
 
 Matthew: any ideas what can be wrong?  (I thought that this can be
 related to the problem of mred running with singleInstance, but it
 doesn't seem to be it.)
