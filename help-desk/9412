>Description:
The "Search PLT Manuals" link on the left-hand side of the top-level PLT documentation page is broken.

It's looking for file:///Users/cobbe/Applications/plt/doc/search/index.html

I have DrScheme installed in /Users/cobbe/Applications/plt, and the main doc file is at /Users/cobbe/Applications/plt/doc/index.html.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.
Hit F1 without typing anything in either window.
In the new browser window, click the "Search PLT Manuals" link -- 2nd item in the lower sidebar on the left.
404.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 27 May 2008 20:41:38 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 27 May 2008 20:41:38 -0400
Reason>>> Yes, it was in the middle of my work, and the links were
basically empty stubs.  I finished most of the help work
now, except for the actual search code, but I added stub
pages for now, so this specific problem is gone.
(And in a few hours the new search will be in place.)
