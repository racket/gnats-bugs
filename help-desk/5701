>Description:
Would it be possible for Help Desk to provide a function similar to this one:

      (define (goto-help manual link)
          (let* ([end-of-url (finddoc-page-anchor manual link)]
                 [full-url
                  (format "http://127.0.0.1:~a~a"
                          (hd-cookie->port (get-hd-cookie))
                          end-of-url)])
            (send-url full-url))))

rather than the do-it-yourself-and-assume-the-server-is-running-the-way-that-format-string-above-shows
function that I can write with the current interface?

An additional improvement: the built in version could retain the search pane at the top, unlike the above version.

 I've added `goto-manual-link', available from help-desk.ss in the help
 collection.

 I think `help-desk-browser', which is already in help-desk.ss, does
 that.

 Okay, I'll use that. Can you update the docs to say that it has this
 behavior?
 
 Thanks,
