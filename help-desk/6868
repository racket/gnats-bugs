>Description:
The text in the search text field after the label "Find docs for:" isn't
selected when I double click in the search text field.
What happends is that no text is selected.
I expected the word under the mouse pointer to be selected on a double click
and all the text in the search field to be selected if I triple click.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open the DrScheme Help Desk
2. Type some text in the search field at the bottom
3 alt 1. Double click in the field to select the word under the mouse pointer 
to select it
3 alt 2. Triple click in the field to select all the text in the search field
4. Be confused when the text isn't selected it isn't
