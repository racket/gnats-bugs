When I try to send a bug report from Help Desk, after pressing the button to do the final submission, Help Desk appears to be submitting the bug.  After a relatively long time (a minute or so), an error box appears which states that the connection to bugs.plt-scheme.org was refused.  Retrying the submission produces the same error.

 Do you have a firewall of some kind in place?
 
 Can you make other (non-web) internet connections?

 I can ssh into the bug server (I didn't try to log in of course).  Are
 there any particular ports or protocols I should try?  Thank you,

 The client connects to bugs.plt-scheme.org on port 1025. Does it work
 to telnet to it?

 Telnet to that port does not work.  Telnet to port 1024 on that machine
 returns an immediate "Connection refused" message, not a long delay like a
 telnet to port 1025 does.  Is there something in particular that might
 lead to port 1025 being firewalled by itself?  It looks like it is used
 for Microsoft RPC and so might be firewalled to contain viruses.

 It looks like this particular issue is confined to port 1025 in
 particular.  Ports 1024 and 1026 didn't have the problem.  Anyway, as you
 may have seen, I submitted my report via the Web.  Maybe the Help Desk
 should just submit to the Web form too?  Thank you,

 This issue is back.
 
 What had we decided to do before? IIRC, we were going to use port 80 on
 bugs.plt-scheme.org and render bad answers as html? Has the email
 tunnel been set up there yet?

 As I recall, we were going to HTTP (on port 80) instead of SMTP.

 I thought we were going to use SMTP on port 80. I guess we can make up
 some kind of XML format, but I thought earlier that you had found it
 easier to make a simple tunnel? Maybe the security concerns make it
 worth it now?

 Don't we have to use HTTP to get through proxies?

 Oh. I have no idea what they check for!
 
 I guess I can use POST to send the data. Or, we could encode something
 into the multi-request-per-connection HTTP/1.1 protocol.

 SMTP on 80 would be close to impossible.  You'll need some server
 process that will wait for input and guess whether it should go to a
 web server or to SMTP...
 
 I don't remember what your reply was, but I think that the most sane
 approach would be to simply use the same bugs.plt-scheme.org page in
 help-desk.  It should ideally behave in exactly the same way, except
 for some value auto-filling that help-desk will do.  The bug report I
 just filed was done this way, so it seems to work, a little ugly and
 hard to fill in help-desk (eg, tab does not jump to the next field).
 
 If you can hack this to work fine, then the current system will be
 fine as it is, and the advantage is that it is easy to change the html
 page on the server when the fields are modified.  Also, if people have
 problems with proxies, web redirections etc, they'll see the rendered
 result.

 The GUI frontend is not broken, so we shouldn't fix it. Using forms in
 Help Desk's browser is going to be much crappier than what we have.
 
 The protocol for the communication (once the user submits the bug
 report) is completely up for grabs, tho. Anything you want there is fine.

 Do proxies generally allow POST?

 OK.  You lose the ability to customize it remotely, but that's all.
 (The 299 help-desk does not render the submittion form, it just says
 "stopped".)
 
 (Another idea is -- have the bug report dialog connect to some page on
 bugs.plt-scheme.org which will list fileds and types, and the dialog
 will be filled according to that.  Shouldn't be too hard since there
 is only one column of fields.)

 Well, POST will be the easiest.  If you use the same field names, then
 you could send the data to the same place that bugs.plt-scheme.org
 goes, which is bugs.plt-scheme.org/cgi-bin/bug-report -- a script that
 Paul wrote that uses sendmail to submit the bugs.  Then there will be
 double benefit from any hacking on that script.
 
 Again, this functionality is there now, so you can do that without any
 changes on the server.

 They should, or you'd be aware of using a proxy since you won't be
 able to use such forms...

 Well, we haven't needed that ability yet. The bug report form hasn't 
 changed much in many years.

 Look, we have a crappy browser. I don't see why we should start doing 
 things that don't need doing esp with the side-effect of making what we 
 have and need worse!

 Just an idea, and unrelated to the browser, just customizing the bug
 submission through a dialog which seems simple.  It did not change in
 years but there is the change that we talked about, of letting people
 classify the bug.  There could be other fields (eg, it might be nice
 to let people say what level they are, so I don't feel stupid
 lecturing someone about basics just to find out he knows more than
 me...), but again, its just an idea.  Consider it shredded.

 The same one -- bugs.plt-scheme.org.  If you use a standard POST, with
 the same fields that are on the main bug submission page, then the
 above cgi script will parse it and generate the bug report.  It will
 need simple hacking to make it handle the additional fields.

 Oh, I see - I misunderstood the first time.
 
 I'm not against those changes, but I suspect that doing it on our
 regular release cycle should be good enough (and keep life simpler,
 which is a good thing).

 Well, I guess whoever does it can do it however, but one way would be
 to move the code that generates the email to the server (ie, it listens
 for a post that contains an email message to whereever the email is
 currently going and actually just sends it out).
 
 I think that I will wait for someone to make a server (and the spec)
 and I'll make the bug report form send according to that spec.
 
 Sound ok?

 No no -- you definitely don't want to do that.  There is a trivial
 perl script called `formmail' that will simply send any data to some
 specified email, which can be used as an easy solution for collecting
 data: you simply put the html page up and have a form with your
 formmail.pl as its action and it'll send it to you.  It turned out to
 be a security problem -- most http logs will have plenty of bad
 references to this thing that hackers and viruses use.

 What I'm trying to say is that it's already there...  It is the same
 script, bugs.plt-scheme.org/cgi-bin/bug-report, that handles bug
 submissions.  You need to send that page POST data that contains the
 fields.
 
 I will post an input example soon, right after I finish the 209
 release.

 The spec is simply a POST query, like the following:
 
 originator=My+Name&replyto=my-email%40address.com&subject=Summary+of+my+problem&release=666&platform=windows-nt&severity=serious&class=sw-bug&description=The+description+of+the+problem%0D%0ASecond+line+of+description&how-to-repeat=A+short+sequence+of+steps%3A%0D%0A1.+first+step%0D%0A2.+second+one%0D%0A3.+last+one
 
 The fields that are currently used are:
 
   replyto
   originator (Originator)
   subject (Synopsis)
   severity (Severity)
   class (Class)
   release (Release)
   platform (Environment)
   description (Description)
   how-to-repeat (How-To-Repeat)
 
 I can easily extend this list.  The parenthesized labels are the Gnats
 fields that are put in the PR email.
 
 The reply is a simple HTML that either says that you should expect an
 answer or that there was an error.  If you can render the returned
 HTML it would be best since problems that result from places on the
 way (proxies, caches, firewalls) will be obvious.
 
 Anything else needed?

 That's fine too -- I just made it go to me and you, you should have
 seen a test message.  If you get a real submission, just ignore it --
 I'll make it go to the DB.  (Just remember to tell me when you're
 done.)

 I've changed the bug report submitter to use the web form now.
 
 I see that there is no longer a url in the bug reports, tho. 
 
 Also, if you changing the output, can you put the environment at the
 end (it's got lots of detail that is better read after the description
 and how-to-reproduce, usually).
 
 I was only able to checkin one of the changed files to CVS, tho. Too
 bad. I'm off to the next thing now. I'll try again later tonight.

 Well, what you see is the raw email that is later sent to gnats.
 Later, it is synthesized into a normal bug report that looks like the
 usual.  To disable making everyone know, I just changed the script to
 send the email to both of us instead of to gnats, so these things
 don't even get into the system.

 It doesn't really matter for the same reason -- these emails are not
 something you ever deal with.  Are there any other fields that you
 want to add?

 There was also the additional string-constant...
 
 Anyway, I'm sure it will work fine, but I do have a few of comments:
 
 * The rendered result does not wrap -- it would look better if it did.
 
 * If there was an error, the error page says "<Click here> to submit a
   new report".  Can you add a bogus "help-desk" argument that will be
   set to "true", and I'll make the script say "Click XXX below to
   try to edit your bug report".
 
 * Related to the above -- the "XXX" would currently be "reset".  I

 It just does what the html renderer does. I'm not sure about that
 library. I'll check into it.

 Oh, I think I know what you are talking about now.
 
 re-submit isn't good because it doesn't actually submit anything. I
 don't like restart because it already has an overloaded meaning for
 computers. Back is kind of okay, but doesn't really mean what the back
 button means in browsers.
 
 Any other words?

 The cgi-script will try to catch all errors that occur when it sends
 the email, and if it happens it shows a different result page.  I now
 added a (+ 12 "34") after sending the email so you should see that
 result when you submit a bug.

 The label on the button you get after submitting the bug, which goes
 back to the bug dialog.

 Well, I share your objectsions to re-submit and to "restart".  "back"
 seems to make the most sense because it is sort of like going back in
 a browser -- if someday there is enough support to render an html
 form properly, then it will actually be a simple "back".
 
 The reason I don't like "reset" is that I thought that it would reset
 the whole thing and remove information -- my natural reaction was to
 hesitate to click it since I thought that the information will be
 deleted...  With a "back" label I (as a browser user) would expect the
 exact behavior that happens.

 Another problem -- you don't actually use post...  I have verified
 this by looking at the http log file, and you do actually fetch a url
 that contains the whole thing.  With actual bug report you will run
 into Apache's internal alarms for avoiding bogus huge urls.  (The url
 is currenly about 4kb).
 
 I'd guess that the `get-pure-port' on line 421 should change, but I
 don't know how things work exactly...

 The url library appears to be pretty uninformative on this point and
 the error messages I get back from the webserver aren't very
 informative.
 
 Also, I think that you should drop that "try again" link from the error
 message page.

 it's very simple.

 Eli, why do you quote yourself? I read what you wrote once, already!
 (This comes across as an insinuation that I'm _not_ reading what you
 wrote, you realize?)
 
 Anyways, yes. Please try it out.
 
 Also, does changing that code below also change the behavior of the
 web-page bug report form? If so, that's not good.
 
 I can go make these changes myself, but I would prefer to be able to
 test them somehow, rather than relying on you. Is it possible for me to
 run the server locally, or is it possible for me to put my changes out
 to the real server?

 Sorry, not intended.  The only reason I quoted myself was that it was
 easier to copy+paste then re-write.  (I know it was unclear whether
 that intentional error was left or not, and I know that on your end
 you see the same response so you're pretty much blind, therefore such
 questions are obviously justified.)

 Yes -- but that's why I suggested adding a "help-desk=true" binding
 and make the code react differently to help-desk submissions.

 Yes, but I prefer for the two things to be in the same place, it makes

 I think that it will be more manageable the other way (two functions
 tends to work better than one function that takes a boolean tends in my
 programming experience, esp if the functions ever start taking
 different sets of arguments)
 
 But I will add "help-desk=true".

 I just want it localized in a single file, even if there's are two
 seperate parts in that file.  The bug thing is very distributed and
 difficult to keep up as it is.
 
 (When I think about it, it's probably one of the most distributed
 things I deal with -- relying on code in help-desk & iplt/web, web
 server setup, gnats and gnatsweb setups, mail server setup with spam
 and virus detection, firewall settings, and a network tunnel.)
