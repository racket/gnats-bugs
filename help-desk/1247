The HTML renderer fails to display <pre> tags properly.
The code

<pre>
(define (f x)
  (cond
</pre>

appears with a blank line between the two lines, presumably
because of some cr-lf issues.

 This is a tricky problem. Currently, urlr.ss opens files in binary
 mode, so no text translation occurs. This is the preferred behavior,
 because our html files will not be different (ie there won't be one
 set of docs for each platform, each conforming to a different textual
 standard). In fact, they all use the convention that requires no
 translation (unix's I think?). So, the tour will have to conform to
 this convention as well, sadly. If you are using mzscheme, it should
 be sufficint to write the files in binary mode, I'd think. Then, they
 will be read in binary mode and no extra linefeeds will be inserted.
