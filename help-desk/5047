>Description:
In the Bug Report Form, the Help menu is empty.
This is not only unhelpful, it's also a bit confusing,
because clicking on "Help" looks, at least momentarily,
like it has exposed a software bug (no drop-down ...).
At the very least, it should get the user a Help Desk
or something.  An empty Help menu just looks bad!
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to submit a bug.  Click on Help.
