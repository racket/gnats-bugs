>Description:
Just rebuilt from CVS and attempted to install 
several manuals w/n help desk: R5RS, MzScheme, 
DrScheme, MzLib.  The installations completed without
error messages, but help-desk cannot find any of the
new manuals.  Searching works fine, but clicking on
the link in the search results window gets you a 404.
