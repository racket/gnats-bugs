Any attempt at running HelpDesk (either from within DrScheme or from command line) ends with the following message:

tcp-listen: host not found: 127.0.0.1

I've never had any similar experience with prior version.

Is this a bug or an installation problem?

 Are you running Windows 95, 98, or Me?
 
 There is a problem with TCP/IP support in Windows 95/98/Me.  The
 upcoming v202 will have a fix.
 
 In the meantime, change "127.0.0.1" to "localhost" in the following
 files:
 
   PLT\collects\help\help.ss
   PLT\collects\help\private\browser.ss
   PLT\collects\help\private\server.ss
   PLT\collects\help\private\external-search.ss
 
 Make sure to make backups of the original files.

 I assume this fixed your problem, yes?
