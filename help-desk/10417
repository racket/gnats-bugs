>Description:
If the browser to which the variable "plt:framework-pref:external-browser" is set is not in the user's path, DrScheme crashes during launch with the following error:

set-default: external-browser: checker (#<procedure:...ework/preferences.ss:354:17>) returns #f for epiphany, expected #t

To mitigate:  Change the variable plt:framework-pref:external-browser on line 8 of ~/.plt-scheme/plt-prefs.ss to a browser which is in your path.  Presumably, one should also change the variable "external-browser" on line 7 of this file.  (For me, these variables were both set to epiphany, which I recently uninstalled)

However, changing one's system in this way shouldn't stop DrScheme from working ... probably this means that DrScheme should look up the default browser each time it's loaded rather than at install, and give a warning rather than crashing if a browser isn't available.  Crashing completely at startup in this way is a bit extreme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove the browser to which the variable "plt:framework-pref:external-browser" is set from your $PATH.  Then start DrScheme.

 It looks like preferences:set-default isn't being used quite the way
 it was intended (just judging from the error message). If something
 isn't clear about that, please let me know.

 Sorry -- this is meant to be a message to the maintainer of
 external-browser default preference code. If that's no one, I can do
 it. :)
