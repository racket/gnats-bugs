>Description:
I wanted to know if I had installed Alex Shinn's new "fmt" package.  So I opened Help Desk, and clicked on the "Manuals" link, and scrolled down to the "Installed Manuals" section ... and was dismayed to find that the entries are not alphabetized.  That means that I have to read each one carefully to see if it is "fmt".  Bummer.

 I'm aware of that, but that's pretty awkward: it requires that I
 (gasp!) use the mouse, possibly because I fiddled with the "Enable key
 bindings in menus" preference (although I'm not sure).
 
 (Yes, I'm an Emacs weenie.)

 I finally checked, and the bug is indeed fixed, but: the alphabetizing
 is done in a case-sensitive manner, so that (on my box) "srfi
 collection" is the last entry, well after "XML collection".
 
 Could you change the sort to ignore case?
 
 Thanks
