>Description:
I wiped out my plt director and did a fresh checkout and build. Upon opening Help Desk I noticed this error message in red:
FAQ [finddoc: manual index "drscheme" not installed], ...

So I did a CVS refresh of the DrScheme manual. It seemed to succeed, but upon restarting DrScheme, Help Desk did not recognize that it was installed. As I try to install other manuals, the same thing happens. The manuals seem to be installing ok in plt/collects/doc but they and their indexes aren't being integrated.

Also, searching for something like button% fails, but didn't their used to be a default index installed with keywords that Help Desk would use to prompt you to install a specific manual? If so, this isn't working either.

 Robby,
 
 I've tracked down why I was having the problem that the manuals  
 couldn't be found, but I'm not sure what went wrong.
 
 This was my PLTCOLLECTS, which it has been for some time now.
 
 Copernicus:~% echo $PLTCOLLECTS
 /Users/raymond/Unison/Systems/Collects:
 
 I printed out the result of (collection-path "doc") in finddoc.ss and  
 got
 /Users/raymond/Unison/Systems/Collects/doc
 
 So I unset my PLTCOLLECTS and Help Desk worked again.
 
 But now I don't have access to my own collections. Am I doing something  
 wrong or is there a bug in the way that PLTCOLLECTS is being handled?

 To followup on my own post. I added the standard plt collects directory  
 along with own to PLTCOLLECTS and that's fixed everything, but I wonder  
 why I never had this problem before.

 That sounds like a bug. Thanks for the extra info in tracking it down.

 The
 
    :
 
 at the end of the PLTCOLLECTS that you sent before means that the std
 plt collects paths should go there automatically. Probably you added
 the standard at the front? That would correspond to a leading colon.
 Anyways, it certainly sounds like a bug and not something wrong with
 your setup.

 Is this sorted out now, by any chance?

 Sorry for the extra email.
