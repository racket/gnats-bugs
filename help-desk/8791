 Did you edit the stack trace, by chance? Was there more below what is
 shown there?

 Okay, thanks.
 
 I'm not sure what is going on, but I'll keep my eyes open.
 
 If you wouldn't mind, could you move your preferences file out of the
 way and see if it works? If so, put it back and see if it breaks
 again? If so, send the prefs file to me?
 
 (I'm adding bugs back onto the CC so we have a record for later.)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I think that this Windows-specific bug was fixed late on June 29 (or
 June 30, depending on your timezone).

 Can you try re-building your MrEd binary from the latest in SVN?
 
 Thanks,

 OK, I did; it still died.  I also paid slightly closer attention to
 what I did: at the end of the installation process, the installer
 presents a screen that asks me if I want to run DrScheme, and has a
 checkbox that is checked.  I cleared that, and then started Help Desk
 from the Start Menu.
 
 Matthew thinks the bug has been fixed in SVN, so (assuming I can
 figure out how to build it on Windows) I'll give that a try.

 Yeah -- I saw that message and I think he's right. I had forgotten
 about that bugfix.
 
 Sorry, I should have replied to it and told you to skip my message.

 There was some problem with nightly builds, so I pushed a manual build
 through.  You can get it from http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/.
