>Description:
The Bug report form prompts for my name, but doesn't
then use it in the submitted bug report (the mail
header doesn't use the name string at all).
>How-To-Repeat:
I have Name set to my full name, and email address
set to sk@cs.brown.edu.  In the previous bugs I
submitted, and hopefully this one also, the From:
line to the bugs address just has the email address.
