see the buttons on the form.
I'm working with an 800*600 resolution.

>How-To-Repeat:
Use a 800*600 resolution
Click on the button

Responsible-Changed-When: Sun Nov 25 14:42:30 2001
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    help-desk problem
State-Changed-From-To: open->feedback
State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Tue Dec  4 19:05:54 2001
State-Changed-Why:
    I have re-arranged the bug report so the 
    synthesized information is shown on the rhs
    instead of the bottom of the bug report form.
    It is less than 800x600 under unix with my
    fonts, but I'm not sure about other platforms,
    esp. if you use big fonts. I suspect it is okay
    now, however.
    
    Shriram: can you try this on your computer?
    You will need to CVS. If you cannot CVS for some
    reason, let me know and I will send instructions
    on how to just try it without CVS-ing everything.
State-Changed-From-To: feedback->closed
State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Wed Dec  5 20:33:24 2001
State-Changed-Why:
    The synthesized information is now in a separate
    dialog that appears when you click the 
    "show synthesized information" button.
    
    Thanks again for the bug report!
