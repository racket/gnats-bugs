>Description:
what if there is possibility to distinct 
searches - i.e. search for function , search for class , for methods , fields , for instances in current application, macros  etc. ?

this would be useful for example for this :
when user write "(send " there would be a list with found instances (or functions returning instances as values) to which is  possible  to "sent"  
something. or
 "(send instance " there would be list of found methods which user can invoke. 

or "... (class  " ,"(make-object " or etc.- list or tree of possible classes to inherit and possible interfaces to implement .
for example in franz allegro cl there is function "complete symbol" - why not to have similar in scheme ?

Next if user can customize such distinction for example :
f1 on some word will search for this world 
but ALT+F1 would search for word as it was class 
SHIFT+F1 - as it was Instance and so forth .

what happens to gui builder ? 

thanks
