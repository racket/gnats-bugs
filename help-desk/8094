 These urls look like they are in the old format, ie:
 
   "/doc/drscheme/..."
 
 and now they need to be in some new format (that I think you worked on?)
 
   http://doc1.helpdesk-internal.localhost:8000/drscheme/index.htm
 
 This whole thing is a mess and I'm not sure what the right thing to do
 is. I recall you telling me that the "doc" moved from the url to the
 hostname, but I don't recall why it did that.
 
 Is there a rationale?
 
 In the meantime, I think I've got to make some kind of a link checker.
 I'll look into the feasibility of that one ...

 The link should use some function like `finddoc-page', instead.

 Of course, they use functions -- it's just the functions that build the
 wrong urls. The FAQ one uses the function `manual-entry'. I'll look
 into it.

 Okay, I'm confused. finddoc-page returns the first kind of url above.

 I've search a little, and it looks like finddoc-page-help (from
 help/private/finddoc.ss) is generating a link to
 
   /doc/drscheme/drscheme-Z-H-5.html
 
 which should probably be using the new bogus http thing that Matthew
 changed.  (I would have dug a bit more but must run to a doctor
 aptmt.)

 Thanks, Eli. Matthew and I are having a similar conversation (summary
 so far: Robby said "the links don't go to the doc.helpdesk.whatever,
 they go to the old-style "/doc/whatever". Matthew said "they should be
 using finddoc-page and friends". Robby said "they are". :)

 Yes, I've bgotten lost in the maze.
 
 Now that I look a little more, I think `get-help-url was the one that
 most often works. It takes a path and returns the right style of URL.
 
 Maybe that combined with `find-doc-directory'?

 We're really suffering from the too many cooks syndrome.
 
 Can I ask again why the interpretation of the urls had to change?
 
 The finddoc module was supposed to be the one that always works and
 I've rewritten lots of code to use it and documented it, etc. It would
 be nice to know why it suddenly became the wrong thing.

 The old implementation assumed that all docs were in the same
 directory, and that it was in the `doc' directory in the parent of the
 `help' collection's directory.
 
 To allow the web server to send HTML from multiple root directories,
 there have to be multiple virtual hosts. I see no way around that.
 
 Probably, "/doc" on the main virtual host could be re-written to a
 suitable virtual host in the client. I didn't quite see that
 possibility when I started; still, I think it's probably best to move
 the resolution to `finddoc'.

 Sorry - it wasn't clear to me that `finddoc' was an external function,
 so I didn't think to look for documentation.
 
 I note that there were two implementations of `finddoc': one in
 "manuals.ss" and one in "finddoc.ss". That duplication was probably the
 beginning of my confusion.

 Okay, I think that maybe the problem is that finddoc just didn't get
 converted to use the new stuff. That seems to work now.
 
 But, I can't figure out how to make a url that goes directly to the
 teachpack manual's front page.
 
 Any hints on that?

 There is only one implementation in the source I see (manuals.ss
 re-exports finddoc.ss's at the moment).
 
 FWIW, it was actually Steckler's original call that one of the finddoc
 function should be the external function (for servlets and the tour)
 and I've just tried to keep that working.

 Okay, I figured out how to go from the "key" of a manual (like
 "teachpack") to where the manual is properly, I believe, but only as
 long as the manual is actually installed.
 
 Sadly, that's not enough.
 
 I need to be able to have a button in drscheme be clicked and then help
 desk should show up, pointing to the tour, except that the tour might
 not actually be installed (so searching the docs paths for directories
 named "tour" won't cut it).
 
 What should happen in that case?
 
 I'd like to get to a url that will trigger downloading of the tour (the
 behavior we used to have), but I'm not sure how to get that back.

 Well, I merged them, of course. Whatever violence I inflicted on the
 code, I at least know to clean up diverging copies of the same
 function! :)

 Pick any doc root. The client side detects the missing document for any
 of the roots.
 
 So,
 
   (get-help-url (build-path (find-doc-dir) <doc-name>))
 
 should work (probably [I think]).

 So what's the state of this?
 
 Is there anything I can do to fix it?  I'd prefer including a fix in
 349.100 since it's a pretty visible problem.

 My hand is going all numb, so I think I'm going to try to avoid typing
 any more today ... but I hope to fix it all tomorrow.

 I don't know how to disambiguate this sentence:
 
 1. You're telling yourself to stop waiting and start fixing it.  (In
    this case I'll wait.)
 
 2. You're telling me to stop waiting.  (In this case I'll go ahead
    after this build is done -- but it will be noticeable, I already
    had two people mail me without an announcement...)

 Uhh... do I usually talk to myself in emails to you? How strange! (Was
 I saying that last time).
 
 I'm surprised it is noticeable now when it has been that way since
 Matthew fixed up help desk a while back and no one said anything then.
 
 But, I will do my best to do it today. I hope I will find time. I'll
 let you know.

 (I got confused -- I think that instead of "to myself repeat" you
 meant "to repeat myself"...)

 Well -- that's the difference between a nightly build that people
 expect to be broken and a version that is put out with a call for
 testing...  (The two people who noticed it is the guy from the science
 collection who got the internal message, and my friend from NYU that I
 told him that we're pushing an alpha out soon.)

 OK, to avoid further pressure I'll put it out as it is, and re-build
 when you get to it.

 Huh? "to repeat myself" is what I wrote, no? It means that I'm saying
 something that I've said before.

 Okay ... there's only one more known bug, I think. When the tour is not
 installed and you go to the About DrScheme dialog, and then click on
 the tour button, you get a "link not found" error, rather that getting
 redirected to the "download manual" page.
