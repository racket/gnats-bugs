 That's a different error than the one for which I suggested rebooting.
 
 Another user reported the same problem, which he resolved by
 uninstalling, deleting his PLT directory, and reinstalling.
 
 Did you have v200 (or an earlier version) installed?  Do you know if all
 its files were successfully deleted after uninstalling it?

 At the Windows command prompt, what happens when you run
 
   ping 127.0.0.1
 
 You should get reply packets back, as on my Win2000 box:
 
 	Pinging 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:
 
 	Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
 	Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
 	Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
 	Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
 
 	Ping statistics for 127.0.0.1:
 	    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
 	Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
 	    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum =  0ms, Average =  0ms
 
 If you get errors, that suggests there's something wrong with the
 networking on your machine.

 Hmmm, my next guess is there's a problem with MzScheme's TCP/IP for
 Windows 9x -- we've had no problems with Windows 2000/XP here.
 
 I'll investigate.

 It suggests that MzScheme's TCP/IP doesn't understand the 127.0.0.1
 address.
 
 Here's what you might try, as a test.
 
 In plt\collects\help\private, change "127.0.0.1" to "localhost" in these
 files: browser.ss, external-search.ss, and server.ss.
 
 In plt\collects\help, make the same change in: help.ss.
 
 Make backup copies of your files before making the change, of course.
 
 Let me know what happens.

 I've now had a chance to try v201 Help Desk with Win98.
 
 I hadn't booted into Win98 for a long, long, time -- and I'd swapped out 
 my motherboard during that period.  So it took me some time to get 
 networking -- and much else -- working properly again.
 
 Before I got DNS working correctly, Help Desk behaved erratically.  It 
 would take a minute or
 more before Internet Explorer appeared.  I still had IE4 installed when 
 I began -- I installed
 IE6 as part of this exercise.
 
 But once I had my DNS addresses set correctly, Help Desk started just 
 fine, both from
 DrScheme and from the command line.  IE6 appeared within a few seconds 
 and showed
 the Help Desk home page.
 
 So my conclusion is that Help Desk and MzScheme's TCP/IP work at least 
 adequately under
 Windows 98.  My current guess is that there's something slightly not 
 right in your networking
 setup -- although I don't know what that something is.

 As indicated in my earlier message, I had no real problems with Help
 Desk in Windows 98 with unmodified code.
 
 Are you running "Second Edition", or the original Windows 98?

 It returns #f, even though I'm able to use symbolic URLs in Internet
 Explorer with no trouble.
