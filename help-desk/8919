>Description:
Clicking on one of the "refresh" links in Help Desk's list of manuals produces this error message:

((dynamic-require (quote (lib "refresh-manuals.ss" "help")) (quote refresh-manuals)) (list (cons (bytes->path #"mzscheme") "PLT MzScheme: Language Manual")))

UNKNOWN::97: read: expected a `)'


... this seems like the kind of bug that could also be fixed by
completely destroying and re-downloading my PLT tree, and I'd be
glad to try this if this error is not reproducible.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open help desk. Navigate to "manuals." Click on "refresh" link of "PLT MzScheme: Language Manual". See error.
>Fix:
fix & problem detailed below
>Release-Note:
This is a contract violation. Not a type error.

 Well, that's a mysterious one to me. I get the error too, but the sexp
 in the error message is actually just fine, parens wise.
 
 John: the refresh all link works so at least that's something for now.
 
 Jens Axel: your name is next to some relevant lines in
 help/private/manuals saying something that could indeed be related to
 the issue ...?

 This is now fixed in SVN.
 
 The culprit was the > in bytes->path, so I added an export
 of bytes-to-path to refresh-manuals.ss and used that instead.

 Ah, clever. I spent some time thinking about how to avoid that > in
 there, but forgot that I could use the toplevel. Duh.
 
 Thanks,
