>Description:
Hello! I think I found a bug in tutorial.
It's on this page: http://docs.plt-scheme.org/quick/
In part "5. Local Binding" there is a code:

"  (define (checkerboard p)
    (let* ([rp (colorize p "red")]
           [bp (colorize p "black")]
           [c (checker rp bp)]
           [c4 (four c)])
      (four c4)))   "
(It refers another part of code, upper on page)

But it can't be compiled! I send you my version of it below.

I am just learning Scheme, sorry, if I am mistaken about this.

Good luck!
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (checkboard p)
  (let* ([rp (colorize p "red")]
         [bp (colorize p "black")]
         [c (checker rp bp)]
         [c4 (checker c c)])
    (checker c4 c4)))

 I know the response to this bug report is very late.  But I don't
 think this is a bug, and that this item should be closed.
 
 I'm assuming that the error the user encountered has to do with
 'four', as Alexander's revised definition doesn't have it.  Alexander,
 is that correct?
 
 If so: the definition for 'four' is at the very beginning of the Local
 Binding chapter, and it's assumed that definitions later in the
 tutorial can refer back to prior definitions.

 I contacted Alexander Chaschin, and he agrees that this bug can be closed.
