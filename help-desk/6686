 Hi Francisco, 
 
   There appears to be a problem with the srfi collection documentation.
 It doesn't have the right format. It would be nice to get this fixed
 for v206p1 (which we plan release rsn).
 
 To reproduce the problem, search for for-each. You get an error message
 about list-ref. (I'm going to make Help Desk more robust in this
 regard, but that will mean that it ignores the srfi docs in this case)
