 Yes, I should make it so that link checks whether the MrEd manual is 
 installed.  I think this problem occurred in the old Help Desk, too. 
 
 To install the manual, click on the "Show manuals" link in the search
 frame.  The MrEd manual should show up as an uninstalled manual.
 Click on the MrEd link, then click on the "download and install"  
 link on the resulting page.  
 
 After you've done all that, the link you mentioned should work.

    Fixed.  If manual is missing, you get the "missing manual" 
    page, which allows you to download it.
