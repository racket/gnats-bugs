>Description:
There's at least one "mailto:" link in Help Desk,
in the section on CGI scripts.

When you click on it, you get asked whether to 
use the PLT browser or an external browser.  If you 
choose the PLT browser, you get an error message 
saying the "mailto" scheme is unsupported, which is 
OK, I guess.  

If you choose the external browser,
you get a email message window that has the 
specified email address with "//" prepended in the 
"To:" line.
>How-To-Repeat:
as above
>Fix:
there were a ton of changes, mostly to the url struct parsing,
unparsing, and relative url combinations.
>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation, but a spec drift (ie, the rfcs moved and
we didn't until now)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 03 Jan 2006 09:27:15 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN; non-http urls are now automatically
sent to the OS and the url stuff has been cleaned up.
