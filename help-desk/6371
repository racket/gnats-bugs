 Now we know the answer to John's question:
 
    http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/plt-design/4385.html
 
 It's definitely bad to decode the string before parsing it as a URL.
 The point of encoding is to avoid colliding the with URL delimitters.
 
 Even parts of the parsed string can't be decoded. For example, the
 params and query parts are put into the URL record as still-to-be
 parsed params and queries.
 
 It looks like the safest thing to do for the release is to eliminate
 the decoding for now. But presumably the decoding was there for a
 reason. John?

 These are the functions that construct the url that help desk visits in
 the plt web browser (the first snippet is from the search-callback
 function, if you want to change it).
 
 Here's the url it constructs for the string in question (as a Scheme
 string, of course).
 
 "http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/results.ss?search-string=%23'&search-type=keyword-index&match-type=containing-match&lucky=false"
 
 From what I can tell, this code seems to be doing the right thing.
 
 So, if folks agree about that, I'll take a look into the other side...

 I should have been more explicit in my original message: removing
 `uri-decode' in "url.ss" fixes the reported bug.
 
 Both sides of Help Desk are fine. The side you showed encodes the query
 ok and the other side decodes it. It would have been much nicer if the
 "url.ss" library provided the right functions to construct the URL
 (including encoding), but it doesn't. The interface should change for
 v300.

 That's pretty sad, considering how long ago the bug was reported.
 
 I've re-applied John's change to just the web server. It decodes the
 filename part of the URL, and therefore handles spaces in filename
 indicated the URL.
 
 John and I can poke at this, but is anyone going to take real
 reponsibility for the web server?

 Greg Pettyjohn will take on the Web server as the primary 
 caretaker and Ryan Culpepper will assist. 
 
 When Eli gets in they will get on the bug report list and will
 take over bug reports from there.
