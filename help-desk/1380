>Description:
There should be a link to the MrEd HISTORY file as well
as a link to the MrEd_100.txt file. Right now there is only
the second. I think that the current link text matches 
the link to the HISTORY file (so that link should be redirected)
and a new link should be added called "Upgrading from pre-100"
or something similar for the MrEd_100.txt file.

 I get only the former (on my home machine and on cs).
 
 I advocate leaving it at that (i.e., not worrying about a link to
 MrEd_100.txt), because there are so few 53 -> 100 users left in the
 world.

 You must be looking in a different place. I am looking at
 
   plt/collects/doc/help/release/notes.html
 
 where it has this:
 
 <!-- MZSCHEME="(format |<A HREF=\|file:~a\|>MrEd release notes</A>|
 (build-path (collection-path |mzlib|) 'up 'up |notes| |mred|
 |MrEd_100.txt|))" -->
 
 which is a reference to MrEd_100.txt. I am happy if that is just changed to
 HISTORY.

 Strange. I guess that I missed an upgrade notice for those notes. I will
 download new ones.

 Sorry -- I was out of date (and strangely enough, there was a bug in help
 desk -- don't know how anyone else got up to date).
