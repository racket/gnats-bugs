>Description:
I was trying to get to Languages in Help Desk.
running version 349.100-svn6jun2006.
No problems with the link to Manuals.
Languages link produced the following DrScheme internal error:

"../../private/manuals.ss" broke the contract 
  (case->
    (-> temp2 string?)
    (-> temp2 string? string?))
on get-help-url; expected <temp2>, given: #f

>How-To-Repeat:
I was using ProfessorJ Intermediate Language prior to going to Help Desk
>Fix:
this only happens when using an incomplete installation (ie, instructions
not followed from SVN web page). I've fixed help desk so it doesn't fail
in this case, but things still won't work well.

 Thanks for the PR. The runtime error is now fixed, but the underlying  
 cause of the problem is that you don't have the core manuals  
 installed (and so things won't be really working until you do that).  
 Please see the svn installation instructions on the web page for  
 details on how to get them.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
