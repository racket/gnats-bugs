>Description:
when attempting to read/download docs:

To read docs on line:
via: http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/200.2/html/XXXX/index.htm
-> "The requested URL /doc/200.2/html/tex2page/index.htm was not found on this server."

To download and install the docs:
via: http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/download-manual.ss?manual=XXXX&label=XXXX
-> "A Help Desk servlet terminated abnormally.
Please ask the author to fix the problem based on the details in the Web server's log file."
and Standard Output displays:
Servlet exception: "reference to undefined identifier: make-html-response/incremental"

(but can't seem to find the error log file referenced?)

Just download the docs:
http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/pre-release/bundles/XXXX-doc.plt
-> (seems to work fine)

>How-To-Repeat:
(try it on a machine without all the docs installed)
