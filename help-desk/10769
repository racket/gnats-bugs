>Description:
Running XP SP3 with latest updates.  Blow up occurs using latest Firefox and IE8.  I changed default web browser to IE8 to make sure.  In both cases the web browser comes up showing the help index on the local drive.  At that time I also get the "I'm sorry but you just died" message from Windows asking if I want to send a report to Microsoft.  I can send you the debug file if you wish.  This is consistent on two machines both running XP SP3.  Interestingly I can use the Help Menu entries to log onto the main PLT website and the DrScheme doesn't complain.
>How-To-Repeat:
Bring up main screen.  Click on Help Menu.  Select Help Desk.  Wait for browser to open.  DrScheme aborts.  This is a completely reproducible bug on two machines.
