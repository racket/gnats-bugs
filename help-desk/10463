>Description:
I type "∃" into a buffer in DrScheme and hit F1.  The following URL is generated and sent to my web browser (here, Safari):

file:///Users/sstrickl/Library/PLT%20Scheme/4.2.1.8/doc/search/index.html?q=∃

which seems fine.  However, the term that ends up in the search box is "â\210\203", and of course no terms are found.  So there seems to be some sort of encoding issue going on here.

Checked with Carl and Sam, and the same happens with Firefox (on Mac OS X and Ubuntu).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type \exists<C-\><F1> in a DrScheme buffer.
2. ...
3. Fail!
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:

Reason>>> Fixed at some point.
