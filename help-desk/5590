graphic .ico icon files likely need to be converted to be more cross
platform neutral .gif or .jpg files, as if the help desk is to leverage the
native platform&apos;s browser; therefor not displayable when used in help-
desk pages. (simular issues may exist for use of .bmp, .xbm, etc. file
formats, used elsewhere in PLT when their use may not be strictly
nessisary)


>How-To-Repeat:
plt/collects/help/servlets/plticon.ico can not be opened by Mac OSX

 Do you know if .gif or .jpg files can be shown in the address bar in
 IE/OSX?

 Actually didn't even know that was possible.
 
 I'd be glad to try an experiment if you could forward a piece of HTML
 experiment with.
 
 Thanks, -paul-

 I apologize, I may have confused things by not fully understanding
 the mechanism used to display help-desk synthesized web pages.
 
 When I select a link not on my local server I get the following displayed:
 
 ------- begin -----
 The file you were looking for was not found on the Help Desk server.
 
 Powered by [but-not-displayed: plt-logo.gif]
 -------- end ------
 
 When I display the html source trying to determine why the graphic wasn't
 displayed, I get:
 
 ------- begin ------
 <HTML><HEAD><style type="text/css">body {background-color:white;
 font-family:helvetica,sans-serif}
 </style><TITLE>PLT Help Desk</TITLE><LINK REL="icon"
 HREF="/servlets/plticon.ico" TYPE="image/ico" /><LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON"
 HREF="help/servlets/plticon.ico" /></HEAD><FRAMESET ROWS="100%,*"
 COLS="100%" BORDER="0"><NOFRAMES><H2>Your Web browser does not support
 frames, which are required to use PLT Help Desk.<P></P>Please upgrade to a
 browser that does support frames. The Mozilla browser is a good choice,
 available at <A 
 HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">http://www.mozilla.org/</A>.</H2></NOFRAMES><
 FRAME NAME="outer" SRC="/servlets/index.ss" FRAMEBORDER="no"
 /></FRAMESET></HTML>
 -------- end --------
 
 Which is were I may have misinterpreted the role of: plticon.ico
 
 In any case, plt-logo.gif isn't being properly displayed, although the
 file does exist in the collects/icon/ directory, from what directory is
 is plt-logo.gif file being looked in for?
 
 Thanks, -paul-
