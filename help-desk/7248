>Description:
Sometimes when I try to open the help desk, I get the
following error:

exception raised by exception handler: continuation application: attempted to cross a continuation barrier; original exception raised: procedure application: expected procedure, given: #f; arguments were: doc.txt #<procedure:...vate/colldocs.ss:19:55>

I've seen this happen in 299.30 and up. I can't figure out
what exactly causes it.

Once when it happened I couldn't get the bug to go away,
but I came back the next day and it was working again. At
the moment, though, just restarting DrScheme doesn't seem
to help.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the help desk in any way -- except luckily the bug
report form seems to be working! :)

 Your info.ss cache and your info.ss files are out of date when that
 happens.
 
 Re-run setup-plt.

 A rather creative error message for such a situation, no? :)

 Hm, didn't seem to help. Are there particular files I should delete 
 before running setup-plt?

 Indeed. I've just fixed help desk so that it doesn't croak in this
 situation, but ignores the bad cache information (now checked in).

 No files to delete. But I'm still pretty certain that you have a
 cache.ss file in some compiled directory on your system that is out of
 date wrt your info.ss files. Are you positive you didn't pass any
 arguments to setup-plt and that you ran with the right PLTCOLLECTS /
 PLTHOME / path, etc?
 
 If you are, it would be helpful if you could delete all of the .zo
 files in the help collection, and then do this:
 
   mred -L errortrace.ss errortrace -L help.ss help
 
 and send me the stack trace of the error. 
 
 I'm guessing it will have something around line 19 of
 collects/help/private/colldocs.ss in it (near the top). Assuming so,
 can you add printout like this:
 
         [else (let* ([dir (car dirs)]
                      [info-proc (get-info/full dir)])
                      [_ (printf "info-proc ~s dir ~s\n" info-proc dir)]
 
 and re-run (and send me the output)?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Well, maybe that would be something to build into the get-info /
 find-relevant-directories library (making some new function that
 combined the two and possibly re-built the cache).
 
 Seems reasonable, but also seems like something that Matthew would have
 thought of in the first place; Jacob and I aren't missing something,
 are we?

 No, I don't have any PLT* variables set. I know the path is is right. No 
 arguments to setup-plt.

 Wouldn't you know it, the bug has disappeared again. A little while ago, 
 I had manually thrown away the info-domain/cache.ss file and rerun 
 setup-plt, yet the bug had persisted; but sometime between then and now 
 it went away again.
 
 I've tried restoring the info-domain/cache.ss file that I had thrown 
 away, but the bug is still gone. I'm not sure what I did to make it 
 stop. If it starts happening again, I'll definitely try the errortrace.
 
 Sorry I suddenly can't reproduce it -- if you can think of ways to force 
 the behavior, let me know and I'll try.

 In general, I think adding code to try to patch up an installation is
 trouble, because so many things can go wrong.
 
 Also, I think that programs like Help Desk shouldn't try to write to
 the installation directory, which would happen if it starts rebuilding
 the info-domain cache.
