>Description:
I installed dr scheme 205 on a system running Mac OS X 10.2.  Works great except most of the standard help docs are missing, e.g. core language references and manuals, e.g. the R5R manual and the PLT scheme reference.
Please note that the system I'm sending this bug report is NOT the one experiencing it, though I reproduced the problem on this system as well (I reverted to 204 as a result.)
>How-To-Repeat:
- download installer for MacOSX 205
- install
- search for "cons" in help desk.

 I suspect that you installed some .plt files. Is that correct?
 
 If so, you will find a directory ~/Library/PLT Scheme/205/collects/doc.
 
 Delete it.
 
 You will lose the docs in the add on packages, but your new docs will
 be back.
 
 If this is indeed the case, please tell me the contents of the this
 directory:
 
   ~/Library/PLT Scheme/205/collects/doc
 
 It will help us avoid this problem in the future.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
