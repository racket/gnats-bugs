>Description:
I just downloaded rScheme 102 for MacOS PPC using Netscape 4.72 on
a PowerMac 7600/120 running MacOS 8.6.  The archive was automatically
unpacked.  As directed, I ran Setup PLT.

When I run DrScheme, the title bar changes, showing that DrScheme is
starting up, and then it reverts to the Finder title bar, and the
application menu (top right corner) does not show it running.  The
same happens with the help Desk application.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download onto a Mac.
Open PLT.
Double click Setup PLT.
Double click DrScheme.

 Did you download the "release 2" version, announced yesterday (July 27)?
 There was a known bug with the MacOS version.  The Web page
 now mentions this.  If you didn't see mention of the problem
 with MacOS, you probably have the buggy version.
 
 Try redownloading from

 To more or less reiterate what Paul said, be sure to download the 102 
 release 2 version.  Note that there's no obvious way to know whether 
 the version you're using currently is release 2 or not.  Oops.
 
 OTOH, I'm surprised to hear that you would have this problem with OS 
 8.6; these problems were related to the static linking of WindowsLib 
 and ControlLib, and the use of undefined Gestalt selectors.  The OS 
 8.5 window manager should have no problem with either of these.
 
 If the reccommended solution (downloading release 2) doesn't work, 
 please try starting the MrEd application directly, and tell me what 
 happens.
 
 Thanks,

 I'm not running a Mac.  What are the errors it reports?

 The patches page indicates that the binaries are release 2.  I've 
 added text to make this clearer.

 I don't think the patch should have affected loading of DrScheme, judging
 from the list of fixes on the patches page.  Did you try running DrScheme
 after the release 2 download, but before applying the patch?
