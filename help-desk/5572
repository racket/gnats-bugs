>Description:
doc.txt files are very hard to read because the Help Desk
misses crucial blank lines.
>How-To-Repeat:
Bring up the documentation for parser-tools (search on "lex"
for instance).  There are several necessary blank lines in
the doc.txt on disk, but these don&apos;t appear in the browser.
The result is very hard to read -- you can&apos;t even tell where
lex.ss&apos;s documentation ends and yacc.ss&apos;s docs begin!

 Dang.
 
 I used to have newlines inside PRE's, which worked great under IE.
 
 Because it looked awful in Opera, I changed the newlines to <BR>'s,
 which works with Opera and Mozilla.
 
 I see that IE does not respect multiple <BR>'s inside PRE's.
 
 I'll look for a solution.
