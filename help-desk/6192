>Description:
The "New help Desk" menu item for the Help Desk
window doesn't actually open a new window.

Similarly, the "New" menu item in stand-alone Help Desk
doesn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start stand-alone Help Desk
Select "New" from the "File" menu
>Fix:
the bug was that the frame actually was created, but wasn't being shown and the browser wasn' t being sent to the right place.
>Release-Note:
This seems like a classic case where the contracts won't help. I forgot some state updating that wasn't reflected in any contract.

It's possible there could have been one, tho (the new menu items adds a new visible frame or something like that.)

 The perils of not having a proper automatic test suite...
 
 Thanks for being the monkey at the keyboard!
 
 I've fixed this, but I'll commit it later.
