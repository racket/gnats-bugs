--
How can I get my browser to find Help Desk when it's configured to use a Web proxy? 

Help Desk uses a Web server running on the machine running DrScheme. A Web proxy does not know about that server. In your browser options, have the browser ignore the proxy for the address 127.0.0.1.

I also wonder if the FAQ questions about Windows 3.1 and DOS are 
really frequently-asked ...
