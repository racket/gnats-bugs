>Description:
I emailed this to internal and robby but here's a PR for your organizational purposes. When I run help-desk in 299 I get

compose: expects argument of type <procedure>; given #f

On the cmd-line. Same happens in a message box when I click the help desk menu item.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
the bug: state for the help desk frame mixin wasn't being initialized properly.
there was supposed to be a variable that goes from #f to a mixin to
indicate that further extensions to the mixin aren't allowed.
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation

 Thanks. John just emailed me this (with instructions to actually
 reproduce the bug ...).
 
 Here's his message.
