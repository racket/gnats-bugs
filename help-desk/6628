A Help search in Beginner, for example, currently
does not search the teachpack docs.

Also, the font for the language display (in the lower
right) should use the label font's size, instead of
12pt(?).

 In order for this work properly (at least the first part of the PR),
 the teachpack docs have to be in the known manuals list. In fact, that
 is all that this should need.

 No one has claimed this PR, altho it seems to be critically important.
 
 Shall I go and figure out the teachpack manual and set things up
 properly, or does someone else have this on their TODO?
 
 Thanks,

 From your previous message, it sounded like you just needed to add
 "teachpack" to a list of known manuals.
 
 Is there something else? Or does this list reside somewhere outside
 your control?

 That was my impression, too, which is why I asked whether
 we had to do anything about indexing. -- Matthias

 Indexing should be fine.

 That necessary, not sufficient.

 It is in my control, but if I add it things break elsewhere, until the
 teachpacks actually become a real manual (with .plt file created in the
 right place for downloading and a script of Eli's updated to match)

 Oops, almost forgot about this part. I wasn't setting the font at all
 before -- now it uses the control font (of an area container).
