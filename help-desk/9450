 That's not what I see. I see search results for +. This is the
 predicate that drscheme currently uses to decide how many characters
 around the insertion point (going frontwards and backwards):
 
     ;; non-letter? : char -> boolean
     ;; returns #t if the character belongs in a symbol (approx) and #f it is
     ;; a divider between symbols (approx)
     (define (non-letter? x)
       (or (char-whitespace? x)
           (memq x '(#\` #\' #\, #\; #\"
                         #\{ #\( #\[ #\] #\) #\}))))

 The problem I see has nothing to do with DrScheme's choice of words
 it's about the handling of the URL by the time it arrives in the
 browser.
 
 I'm using Safari on Mac OS X. If i use "a+b" (which is clearer than
 just "+"), then Safari shows the URL
 
  file:///Users/mflatt/Library/PLT%20Scheme/3.99.0.26/doc/search/index.html?q=a+b
 
 where the "+" isn't encoded.

 Oh. I'm out of date on this computer. Duh. Sorry for the confusion.

 OK, so the problem is that I thought it went through the usual
 encoding, but it doesn't -- send-url/file does shell-character
 encoding only...
 
 The call chain is:
 
   help-desk      (in "drscheme/private/help-desk.ss")
   perform-search (in "help/search.ss")
   send-main-page (in "help/search.ss")
   send-url/file  (in "net/sendurl.ss")
 
 I think that the best place to do the encoding in this chain is in
 perform-search, because it should conceptually expect strings, and the
 two functions below it should expect URL bits.  I'm going to commit
 that now -- so tell me if you have an objection and I'll move it.
