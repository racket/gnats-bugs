>Description:
I installed DrScheme yesterday (release 201) on my 
computer (Athlon 1200, 256MB, NT40.SP5), but coudn't
start the help desk (hich worked with DrScheme 103 and 
one of the alhe releases of version 200).
At first, DrScheme couldn't find netscape, but after
fixing this by creating a copy of netscp6 with this name
tehre ois still an error message saying 'File 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/home.ss' not found.

shell-execute: execute failed for: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/servlets/home.ss" (Das System kann die angegebene Datei nicht finden.; errno=2)

Is this a bug or a bad installation?

Yours sincerely,
Reinhard Oldenburg

 The `shell-execute' procedure uses the default browser 
 that's specified in the Windows registry.  So I'm not 
 sure why renaming should be necessary.
 
 Check whether the browser will work for any address at all.
 In DrScheme, try
 
   (require (lib "browser.ss" "net"))
   (send-url "http://www.plt-scheme.org/")
 
 Does that pop up Netscape?
 
 If you've changed the default browser, you might need
 to reboot.  Does that help?

    No response from submitter -- probably the ShellExecuteEx() problem.
