Human Language: philippe
>Description:
Bug reports specify the human language but not the computer
language currently used by the user.  It would be nice to
have that information available.


>How-To-Repeat:
Stare very hard at this bug report.  Try to guess which
computer language I'm currently using in DrScheme.  One
chocolate cookie to the first correct answer (one entry
per person at most, limited offer, no proof of purchase
necessary)

 Python?
 
 I didn't include the languages because they change pretty easily, but
 maybe that's a mistake -- they probably only change often for us, not
 for other people.

 Actually, I don't see how this is going to work.
 
 It looks like the language setting is in a preference whose name is only
 made available to DrScheme tools.  Does this mean we have to make Help
 Desk into a tool?  That won't work when HD is run standalone, even from
 the Mr launcher.
 
 Now, I can see what the format of that preference name is -- but that's
 not guaranteed not to change.
 
 Any suggestions?

 Yes, it won't work when mred is run in standalone mode. You just get
 "unknown" in that case.

 Right -- the name of the preference changes, doesn't it. I had
 forgotten about that.
 
 How about this: Help Desk provides a function like this:
 
   addl-bug-report-information : (-> string) -> void
 
 DrScheme then calls that function with a thunk and Help Desk saves
 those thunks. When creating a bug report, Help Desk calls the thunks
 and puts the results into the confirmation web page. (you could also
 make the thunks return associations from titles to strings or something
 to make the chart nicer, but you get the general idea)
