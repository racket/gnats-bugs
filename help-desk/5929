I tried to submit a bug report from within helpdesk (using external browser mozilla).
After clicking on the confirm button on the page where I verify my bug information, the browser has since then been trying (unsuccessfully) to do something for about 10 minutes

 Hmmm, I just tried submitting a report with Mozilla, no problems here
 (of course).
 
 It could be there was a transient networking problem.  If you still have
 that browser up (unlikely), does hitting Back and re-confirming work?

 Well I don't still have it up, but I actually waited for 12 to 15 minutes,
 hit back and tried reconfirming before waiting another 15 minutes, before
 closing the browser
