>Description:
Using 372, Pretty Big lang level on WinXP.  I searched for "servlet" in helpdesk and got several links into the docs.  Clicking on the link for "servlet root" (for example -- I get the same problem with all the links I tried), I get an error message

File not found: C:\Program Files\PLT-Scheme-372\doc\web-server/web-server-Z-H-4.html

I do not get prompted for DrScheme to download the docs (as I'm used to).  The files are not on the filesystem either; the directory is there but only contains two files "keywords" and "hdindex".
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure how to reproduce in general, but description gives the steps I took on my machine.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 13:51:45 -0500
Reason>>> The help desk browser has been replaced by a web browser interface.
