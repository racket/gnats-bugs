>Description:
When I start up help-desk, it gives me the error message.  Clicking on
"View installed manuals" brings up a dialog saying "<A MZSCHEME=...>
disabled".

SOMETHING IS WRONG 

Error during <!-- MZSCHEME=... -->: disabled 

You got this page because the "help" subcollection of the "doc" collection wasn't found, or the file "index.html" wasn't in the subcollection. 

Normally, Help Desk would start with 
  Error during <!-- MZSCHEME=... -->: disabled 
on this machine. 

View installed manuals 

Version: Error during <!-- MZSCHEME=... -->: disabled 


>How-To-Repeat:
Start up help-desk (installation is CVS + pre-built binary).
