>Description:
this error message occured when using the help desk. 

I searched for 'syntax' and clicked the link for 'syntax-column'. 
It was taking a long time (the 'recycle' icon was on), so I hit break 
on the help desk, which didnt help, and then break on DrScheme, 
which produced this error:

sequence-contract-violation: negative: method set-position cannot be called, except in states (unlocked write-lock), args 60214
>How-To-Repeat:
havent been able to reproduce
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by robby at Wed, 11 Aug 2004 13:14:26 -0400
Reason>>> probably the first break just took a while to kick in (nothing interrupts
a garbage collection)


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 13:50:55 -0500
Reason>>> The help desk browser has been replaced by a web browser interface.
