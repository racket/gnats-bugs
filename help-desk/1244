>Description:
I looked for teachpack in HelpDesk and couldn't find it. 
So I looked for library. It's all over. Here is the 
stuff on "Select Library"


  * Select Library... opens a find-file dialog for choosing a library to
  extend the current language. Click Execute to make the library available
  in the interactions windows. See Extending DrScheme for information on
  creating libraries.

If you follow this link, it talks about writing libraries: 

DrScheme supports two forms of extension to the programming environment:

  * A library extends the set of produces that are built into a language in
  DrScheme. For example, a library might extend the Beginner language with a
  procedure for playing sounds.

  Libraries are particularly useful in a classroom setting, where an
  instructor can provide a library that is designed for a specific
  exercise. To use the library, each student must download the library file
  and select it through the Language|Set Library To... menu item.

Also, please add the sentence: 

  "Definitions in Teachpacks can employ the full Scheme (MrEd) programming
  language."

 I do not know what distribution you have, but it appears the new documentation
 did not get built for it.
 
 Is that right, Paul?

 Robby,
 
 	I think this stuff is in the DrScheme
 manual.  Can you fix this today?  If not,
 I'll do it.

 The docs were all built last night, with the 
 exception of PDF files.  In 
 ~scheme/Web/unreleased/drscheme, the files
 are dated 10/27, and the DrScheme manual has the same 
 problem referred to by Matthias.  
 
 Yes, I cvs updated plt/src/doc.

 Sorry, I did not commit the changes to the drscheme manual. They are
 committed now.
