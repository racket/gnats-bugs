 I re-freshed the manuals. What else do I need to do? -- Matthias

 Sadly, refreshing the manuals doesn't get the one that matters in this
 case. You need to delete cvs/plt/collects/doc/help, restart Help Desk
 and follow the instructions there.
 
 I could make refresh fix this too, but I'm not sure that the extra work
 is worth the extra payoff (It's probably more work than adding the
 refresh button was to begin with!)
