>Description:
After submitting a bug report (successfully?), and clicking
"Confirm", I got a page telling me to either wait 10
seconds or click "continue".

I clicked "continue" and the result was en error message
saying that the session had already ended (or something
to that effect).

I clicked "restart" (as instructed) on the session-over
page, and the servlet terminated.  Stdout/stderr has

 Servlet exception: "extract-bindings/single: synth-info not found in ()"

presumably because the restart link drops arguments
that were embedded in the URL. (I've seen this sort of
problem in a servlet that I wrote.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Submit a bug report. Follow all instructions,
but don't wait 10 seconds.
>Fix:
For me, clicking on the "continue" link results in the
correct page.

However, by using the Back button, and clicking on it a 
second time, I got the error mentioned.  

So I think this bug is not likely to occur in ordinary
usage.

I added an exception handler in confirm-bug.ss, so that
if the servlet is restarted, the user gets a Web page
that indicates a binding is missing, and that the cause 
might be that the servlet was restarted.
