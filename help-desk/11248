 I think that the second set of example you're using are coming from
 the teaching langauges, where numbers with decimals in them are, in
 fact, exact numbers. (You'd have to write #i1.0 for the inexact number
 1.)
 
 But maybe there is a docs problem here that led you astray to be
 reading the wrong manual?

 Yes, this is a problem we struggle with. In this particular case, we
 found that students were confused by how floating point numbers worked
 when working on exercises that involve, say, prices, where it is
 natural to write things like 3.95 and expect that to be exact and thus
 matching math class. That's why we have the extra #i in the teaching
 languages, so there has to be some ugly thing reminding them of the
 "ugly" math that goes into floating point numbers.
