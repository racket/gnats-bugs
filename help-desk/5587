>Description:
When using the new help desk to submit a bug, the "confirm"
page presents the "Description of the Problem" and "Please
.. reproduce the problem" fields with no line breaks.  
This makes them soggy and hard to light^H^H^H^H^H read.

This could be a browser-specific problem, but the text
that gets mailed and included in the database has the
newlines, so the information is there.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start help desk.  Click on "Submit Bug Report."  Enter
text in the Description box and hit the "return" key
while doing so.  Click on the "Send" Button. See no line
breaks.
