>Description:
When collects/net/doc.txt is opened in the Help Desk,
the require-library line reads:
Mz/Mr: (require-library "net.ss" "net")

This is misleading since there is no file "net.ss" but each 
protocol has its own master .ss file, eg "cgi.ss"
>How-To-Repeat:
I opened Help Desk.
Searched for "generate-html-output".
Clicked on resulting link.

 Is this the same as PR 1571?
