>Description:
Help Desk doesn't properly transport readers to
the on-line version of uninstalled manuals.
>How-To-Repeat:
Fresh PLT 207.
Search in Help Desk for "message-box".
You get two hits (message-box and .../custom).
Click on the first link.
The documenation is missing, so you're given the
  choice of installing or reading online.
Click on the link below Read Online.
Next you get the top of the MrEd manual, not the
  section on message-box.  In fact, it's worse:
  searching on that page for message-box yields
  no hits!
