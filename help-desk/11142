Not sure if this is a bug or merely an annoyance.  I have the latest stable version of Opera installed.  I've selected opera as the preferred browser.  When I click on the help desk, my browser doesnt navigate to the help desk.  This may be Opera's problem.

 It might be a change in how Opera handles command-line arguments.
 Does this work (on the command line)? --
 
   opera -remote "openURL(http://racket-lang.org/)"
   opera -remote "openURL(http://racket-lang.org/,new-window)"
 
 The first should open the url, and the second should do that in a new
 window.

State changed from "open" to "feedback" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 13:57:13 -0500
Reason>>> Need to know what the command line is.
