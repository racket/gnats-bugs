>Description:
When I try to launch the Help Desk, the "Standart Output" windows pops up, with the following message:
tcp-listen: host not found: 127.0.0.1

This is strange, because I can launch the Webserver well, as well as Apache or WarFTPd. I had no service launched when I tried to use the Help Desk. DrScheme runs well.
The problem still exist after I restart the computer.
>How-To-Repeat:
I just installed DrScheme v201 under Win98, and launched the Help Desk. The problem is the same when I launch it from DrScheme, or using Help Desk.exe., or Background Help Desk.exe.

 We've had one other Win98 user with the same problem, 
 though we haven't been able to reproduce it.
 
 The solution was to change occurrences of "127.0.0.1"
 to "localhost" in the files server.ss, browser.ss, and
 external-search.ss in "Program Files\PLT\collects\help\private".
 
 Try making backups of those files, and making those
 changes.  Does that help?

 I may be wrong, but isn't that a "sample" file?
 
 If you copy the HOSTS.SAM file to HOSTS, do the original
 Scheme files work?

 There seems to be something odd about MzScheme's TCP/IP with some
 installations of Windows 98.  I have Windows 98 here, and don't 
 experience the problem.
 
 Would you be willing to work with Matthew Flatt on resolving the 
 issue?  He maintains the TCP/IP code.
