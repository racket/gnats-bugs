The result of the function that computed this stuff was just junk. Not
sure how it got put there (and wasn't tested!) Probably I messed it up
during porting to v299.

 So, what is the fix for an existing  windows v299 installation?
 What is the source of error?
 Why is error generated from this help-desk link and not others?
 
 Does the current full-CVS windows distribution include the fix?
 
 e.g. 299.22 is what I have installed and a the current version for download 
 (2004 11 24) is unchanged at 299.22.
 
 Is this a matter of replacing a collection(s) or rebuilding?
 Where can I access fix?
 
 Thanks

 Rebuild it, or wait a day and re-download it (depending on how you
 installed it to begin with).

 A bug in the code that generated the html for that page of the
 documentation.

 That's where the bug was....

 It will tomorrow, after it is rebuilt (presumably -- assuming nothing
 else goes wrong with the build).
 
 Of course, you can use CVS directly instead of waiting for the nightly
 build. It is probably easier to wait, however.

 The version number is independent of this fix. We don't make new
 version numbers for minor bug fixes.
