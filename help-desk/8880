I'm not sure, but I think all you need to do is install 
ashinn	fmt.plt	1 0
and then open help-desk and click the "flush the index and keyword cache" link.

Reason>>> Jacob -- I fixed the help-desk part, but there might be
an issue with planet: I think that you have some rejection
of bad packages, so this might be another test to include.

If not, feel free to transfer back to me and/or close it.

 And here I thought *I* maintained Help Desk! I went and figured out
 the bug and fixed it locally before I realized that you had already
 fixed it.
 
 Oh well.
 
 Your fix is wrong -- the filtering happens in the wrong place. I've
 also added an (annoying) printout so hopefully people get some message
 to help them debug these things.
 
 I'll check it in shortly.

 The bug in Help Desk (that caused it to fail when getting bad input)
 is now fixed and it now prints an error message, in an effort to make
 it easier for people who develop planet packages to notice what's gone
 wrong.
 
 Thanks for the PR.
