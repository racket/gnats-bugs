>Description:
Just an observation folks - not really a bug or complaint.
I've just noticed that the help is a bit more difficult
to navigate with the newer version of scheme.  I imagine
that it has to do with the sheer volume of documentation
you produce.  In any case you are doing a great job!

 Dan,
 
   Can you point out a particular problem you've had?
 
 Thanks,

 More than a particular search term, I was wondering about a particular
 use of the system. For example, one thing that has changed between 209
 and the next release is the behavior of the "f1" key. It now changes
 the language of Help Desk search to the language of the window where
 you hit "f1".
 
 Anyways, it isn't much use to hear "it doesn't work well". Of course,
 we try to make it work well already! You have a hope of getting a
 change if you can provide something more concrete. 
 
 Robby
