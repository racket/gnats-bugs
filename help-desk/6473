>Description:
"This tour is part of an extensive help system
called [helpHelp DeskHelp Desk]."
This line above is from the 
"A Brief Tour of DrScheme version 205", first
line of paragraph three.
It is an example of what must be an unresolved
linking mechanism, I assume. I put the []'s
around the example of the output in "Help Desk".
It is like this all over the documentation.
