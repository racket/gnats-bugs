 Hello PLT,
 
 A couple of things I found:
 o The doc.txt in the plt/collects library on win32 are in Unix format.
  Some text editors don't like that
 o I've download the mzscheme.rs6k-aix.tar.gz from the 100 directory and
  gunzipped and untared in. Then I ran ./install and then bin/mzscheme and
  the header says: Welcome to MzScheme version 53, Copyright (c) 1995-98 PLT (Matthew Flatt)
                                               ^^
                                              Should be 100
 
  And also : (version) --> "53"
                       
 
 Bye.

 True.  But the doc.txt files are really meant to be viewed 
 in Help Desk, where there should be no problem.
