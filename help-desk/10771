I already reported this once but the problem is actually more serious than I thought.  The crash will cause all information in the session to be lost and this will be a great discouragement to students.  Placing the cursor on text and right clicking to search the help files causes the crash too.  The fault occurs in libmzsch3m_6ncc9s.dll at location fdfd7 if that's any help.  I backed up all the way to Version 4.0.1 and the problem is still present though the offset in the .dll is changed.  Earlier this afternoon I worked for several hours without the error occurring.  I thought that it was only blowing up when entering the help documentation via the top help menu bar.  Right clicking and entering via the context menu to search for a term was working correctly.  But then, after I closed out the session and reentered, the problem started occurring on right clicks too.

 (I closed the previous bug.)
 
 FWIW, I did try that on my machine (which is also XP with SP3), and
 there was no crash.
