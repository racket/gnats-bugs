>Description:
This may have already been reported, but I thought I'd pass it along just in case.  In the DrScheme Manual, there is an anchor that brings up a Help Desk dialog box with the following error message:

`cdr: expects argument of type <pair>: given #f'

Hope this helps.

 This actually appears to be in the tour, not the drscheme manual.
 
 The actual bug might just be the usual problem with the teachpack
 manuals, ie they aren't available to nightly builds, and so the tools
 manual needs some better error checking.

 I don't remember such a problem.  The nightly builds do create the
 teackpack manuals.

 PS: I notice that chapter 6.1 is talking about the draw.ss teachpack.
 Maybe in the next round it should become the image.ss library?

 Oh, right. I was remembering an older state of the world. Sorry. Guess
 its just an ordinary bug in the tools manual or something that it
 uses.
