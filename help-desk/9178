I tried to come up with a patch but the code seemed to complex.
maybe separating shell-escaping, from uri percent-encoding can help...

also unix-browser-list isn't lazy enough, all executables checked in turn.

 It looks like the problem is your default browser setting: you use
 
   /home/u1/bin/iceweasel 
 
 for the browser, and it's handed to a subshell with the URL as is, not
 in quotes.  I see two solutions:
 
 1. Improve the text to clarify that your custom settings should have
    quotes.
 
 2. When constructing a command line, add quotes around the URL.
 
 3. (URL-encoding more characters is not going to work since the `#'
    must not be quoted, and the shell won't like it.)
 
 I prefer the second solution, but the problem is that people who
 already use a custom setting that does have quotes will lose them
 since they'll get things like
 
   /foo/bar ""<url>""
 
 Matthew/Robby -- what do you think?

 But that's done to know which browsers are valid options, and it's
 done only once.  I don't think that looking for 10-20 executables
 should be a significant time, but maybe you've seen some other
 slowdown that this causes?
