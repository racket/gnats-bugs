 I've made changes to the .thtml scripts, which will show up 
 when the Help Desk docs are rebuilt.
 
 But there's still a problem with the 2nd entry.  The problem
 under Solaris is that the macro <<DOCDOTTXT>>{mysterx} doesn't
 show up, explaining the choppy text.  Under Windows, the
 macro expands into a link, which when clicked gives the
 message 
 
 	Cannot display "e:\\plt-100\\plt\\collects\\mysterx\\doc.txt":
 	Scheme e unsupported

 Robby,
 
 	This is apparently a bug in the Help Desk software.
 Can you please take over this aspect of PR 1148?  I've made
 the corrections to the text.
