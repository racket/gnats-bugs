>Description:
In the Manuals page from the HelpDesk, it would be nice if:

- the "installed <date>" comment was on the same line as
the manual name (properly right aligned, maybe?). 
Interspersing manual names and installation dates makes
reading the manual names difficult.

- there was a way to refresh a given manual and just that
one.  The "refresh all manuals" should not go away, but
refreshing all manuals takes quite some time, and is
annoying when all you want is to refresh one of them.
That, or the "refresh all manuals" link should test
whether a manual actually needs refreshing before
re-installing it.  How often is, say, the R5RS manual
going to change anyway?
