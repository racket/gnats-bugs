>Description:
1) If the bug report form is closed, you can't get another one
by clicking on the Help Desk link(s).

2) Under X, at least, the Description and Reproduce fields are
too small.

3) Resizing the form causes the labels on the left to be misaligned
with fields they refer to.

4) Under X, at least, the OK and Cancel buttons are overlapped.  The
Cancel button doesn't work.

 You have a pre-release. It has not been released (no announcement, right?)
