mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
In the documentation for syntax-e, there is a section that appears to be an attempt to center a textual figure; within this figure, whitespace (particularly indentation) is apparently quite significant.  Unfortunately, help-desk doesn't render it well, and it's almost unintelligible as a result.

See <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/help-desk.png> for a screen shot of the current rendering on MacOS X.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt at Fri, 21 Jan 2005 18:01:08 -0500
Reason>>> html formatting


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:45 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
