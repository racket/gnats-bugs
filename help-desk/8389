>Description:
The function build-page in /collects/help/servlets/private/read-doc.ss
is missing a BODY TAG in the second branch of the if.

To fix it, replace the current definition with this one:

(define (build-page file caption coll offset)
    (let ([msg (get-message coll)])
      (if msg
	  `(HTML
            (HEAD (TITLE "PLT Help Desk") 
                  ,hd-css)
            (BODY
             ,(format-collection-message msg)
             (HR)
             ,(read-lines file caption offset)))
	  `(HTML
	    (HEAD (TITLE "PLT Help Desk") 
		  ,hd-css)
       (BODY
        ,(read-lines file caption offset))))))
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
not a contract violation -- just bad HTML.

this could have been a contract violation, if Help Desk tried to
validate the HTML (even a very simple check would have caught
this one).

 Thanks!
 
 Did you find an easy way to make the problem to show up in Help Desk,  
 by chance?

 Search for "r5rs" with the search-type "Keyword or index entry" and
 match type "Containing match". On my machine I get 5 results. The
 last is
 
    the HtDP Languages collection
    r5rs.ss in "indexed content"
 
 where r5rs.ss is a link to
 
 <http://localhost:8000/servlets/doc-anchor.ss
 ?file=C%3A%5CProgrammer%5CPLT-FULL%5Ccollects%5Clang%5Cdoc.txt
 &caption=Documentation%20for%20the%20HtDP%20Languages%20collection
 &name=HtDP%20Languages&offset=129#temp>
 
 
 clicking the link lead to the troublesome page.
 
 However, I am not sure, that the problem generates visible problems
 in the HelpDesk browser.
 
 I was embedding the page page returned by the doc-anchor.ss
 in a page with a search bar at the top. To do this, I extract
 the body and insert it in a page with a different design.
 Then suddenly I kept getting blank pages ...

 I see. I've committed the fix.
 
 Thanks very much.
