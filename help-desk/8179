 Looks like you're building from source -- since we avoid making any
 releaseable version available (so there are no different v351s
 around).  The thing is that the documentation is not yet found where
 it's supposed to be found until the release process is done, so the
 problem will probably be solved once we release.  Can you try again
 after the release (RSN)?

 OK -- I see the problem.  I recently cleaned the code, and thad has
 something like this:
 
   (define items
     `(... ,(look for the FAQ link) ...))
 
 so if the link does not exist that red error message stays there.  I
 fixed it now to have a closure instead.
