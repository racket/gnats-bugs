 This is due to the "windowsize" function being used, rather than using
 platform-specific functions to break down a path (ie, split-path).
 
 If that doesn't make sense, I can try to fix the problem.

 Which Help Desk did you use to send this bug report?
 
 I just sent two bug reports using the new HD on Win2000, and my
 apostrophes came out OK.

 I get a similar error, after installing Robby's updates.  [It worked
 just before updating.]
 
 I'll see if I can patch it and preserve his fixes.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 12 16:58:51 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    Those calls to normalize-path have been removed (normalization takes place elsewhere).  And I can search for `module' just fine in HD on my Win2K box.
