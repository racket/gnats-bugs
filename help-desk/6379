>Description:
Parts of the Help Desk are broken --
specifically, at least the R5RS, MzScheme, and MzLib manuals, though there
might be others.  Other manuals (such as the DrScheme Programming Environment)
are fine.  Searching (say, for "if") returns the results from those
manuals, but then clicking on the links yields a blank page.  

I'm using the Brown install of version 204.10-cvs23jul2003.  I asked the 
local maintainer if this might just be a local program; he answered that 
he thought it was not, and that he had noticed the Help Desk seg-faulting as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Blank Documentation pages:
- Open the Help Desk
- Search for "case"
- Click on any of the links in the R5RS, MzScheme, or MzLib sections
- a blank page will come up

I don't know how to reproduce the seg faults; I personally have not seen them.
