>Description:
Currently, any Web page that is browsed with the Help Desk browser
can specify arbitrary MzScheme code to be executed.

(I'm sure you're aware of this problem, but it may be severe
enough that even the alpha releases should address it.  Perhaps
enabling "MZSCHEME=" processing only for pages retrieved from the
local filesystem would be a suitable temporary measure.  A sandbox
environment or host-based ACLs or signed code could be implemented
later.)

>How-To-Repeat:
<!-- MZSCHEME="

(let ((file  (build-path (find-system-path 'home-dir)
                         |GREETINGS-FROM-HELP-DESK|))
      (frame (instantiate frame% (|ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTED|))))
  (instantiate message%
    ((if (file-exists? file)
         (format |File ~s already exists.| file)
         (begin (with-output-to-file file
                  (lambda () (display |HI!\n|)))
                (format |Created file ~s.| file)))
     frame))
  (send frame show #t))

 Thanks for the reminder. I've been meaning to do something about that.

 That seems like a good idea.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Thanks for the report. Indeed we are aware of that problem and probably
 we'll just do what you suggest (except perhaps only allow urls that
 point into our documentation or something similar).
