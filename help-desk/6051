 Actually, the two `string-ci' entries are for string-ci<? and 
 string<=?.  I think the problem is in the program that generated 
 the keywords file in plt/collects/doc/r5rs. 
 
 That file hadn't changed in a long time, but was regenerated 
 for v203 as part of rebuilding the R5RS manual with the 
 latest tex2page.
 
 I'll fix this by hand.

State-Changed-Why:
    R5RS keywords list fixed in latest CVS bundle.
    There's probably still a bug in the makekeywords.ss 
    script for keywords that contain `<'.
