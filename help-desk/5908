 Yes, this is a known problem.  It should be fixed in the next release.
 
 In the meantime, the best workaround I know of requires the use of the 
 Terminal application.  Please forgive my pedantry if you're already a 
 shell master:
 
 1) Start Help desk, go to the manual download page. Choose the Manual 
 you want.
 2) On the new page, click the link labeled "Just download the 
 documentation (no installation)", and put the file somewhere you can 
 find it (in your home directory, say). Make a note of the name of the 
 file you're downloading.  Let's say it's `framework-doc.plt'.
 3) Start the 'Terminal' application (in Applications/Utilities)
 4) execute the setup-plt script manually with root privileges by typing
 sudo /Applications/PLT\ v202/bin/setup-plt ~/framework.plt
 
 (replace framework-doc.plt with the name that you noted. Hopefully, you 
 can read the twiddle in that command line.)
 
 5) Enter your password when prompted.
 
 Please let us know whether this works for you.
