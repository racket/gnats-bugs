 This is by design.  It scores all possible matches, and since `get' is
 pretty popular, it gets a high score.  Two possible solutions:
 
 * Maybe F1 should perform an exact search?
 
 * Currently the algorithm is doing this (in help/search.ss):
 
   - If you search for "foo", then it will search for
     - #rx"^foo$" and if found give it a very high score (1000);
     - #rx"^foo" and give it 200
     - #rx"foo$" and give it 20
     - #rx"foo" and give it 10
 
   - If no matches are found, it will give it -5
 
   - This is done for all given search terms (since you used F1, you
     use only one term)
 
   - It then looks at all the words in all search terms (in your case
     "preferences" and "get") and does all of the above; the resulting
     score is multiplied by 0.9 and added to the above
 
   - Finally, the result is multiplied by 1.1 if the matched item is a
     binding
 
   That's all from many experiments I did with it, and this seems to
   bring relevant search results very high.
 
   So -- a possible improvement is to require that all matches do match
   (with a positive score), but I'm not sure how this will work.

 There's no `preferences:get' in the documentation (i.e., the framework
 docs haven't been scribbled).

 I definitely don't think that a search on an actual identifier should
 fail to turn up that identifier!

 This is irrelevant to what I said below.  (There is no way to get the
 `preferences:get' documentation to appear as the first result without
 actually having a documention for it.)

 Ah, that explains it.  I knew that the framework binding wasn't in the
 scribbled documentation (any way to get the scribble docs to point to
 a local copy of the not-yet-scribbled docs?), but I didn't know why it
 was finding pieces of the word.  I found that behavior quite
 unexpected.
