>Description:
When I select the help desk from the menu bar, a window opens and I get the message "tcp-listen: host not found: 127.0.0.1".  The help desk will not load.

I am assuming that this is a compatibility problem with something.  I have no idea what, though.

 This is a problem with TCP/IP support in Windows 95/98/Me.  The upcoming
 v202 will have a fix.
 
 In the meantime, change "127.0.0.1" to "localhost" in the following
 files:
 
   PLT\collects\help\help.ss
   PLT\collects\help\private\browser.ss
   PLT\collects\help\private\server.ss
   PLT\collects\help\private\external-search.ss
 
 Make sure to make backups of the original files.
