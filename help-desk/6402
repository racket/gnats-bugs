 I'm not sure why, but apparently mred isnt' required into the namespace
 at that point (when running in drs -- it is in help desk). Anyways,
 I've fixed it by adding a require to the code that gets run when
 clicking in the link.
 
 Eli, the changed file to fix this is:
 
   plt/collects/games/info.ss
