Most application / webpage search forms require typing a word, then pressing <return>.  Our new search page searches as you type, and up until recently supported <return> (i.e. ignored it).  Now (on Firefox 2.0.0.13 for Mac) it starts searching as you type, but <return> interrupts the search.

Open the Search Manuals page, start a search, and press <return> before it completes.

 [That was actually a bug, or rather an omission: it was supposed to
 start a search immediately, without the usual delay-after-a-key wait.]

 Now the search is done "in a thread", so the delay defaults to a
 smaller value, and the importace of Enter doing the above is smaller.
 But still, this bug made the search stop on almost any key that you'd
 hit.  Fixed now, and comitted.
 
 (BTW: the reason the search would stop was semi-intentional -- I was
 playing with what happens when the delay before the search fires up is
 noticeable, and saw that if I type something just before the previous
 search ends then I'd still get the results shown and then a new search
 starts.  So I made it stop the search thread on any key, which (as I
 didn't realize) made any other key kill the search too.)
