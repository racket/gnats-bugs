>Description:
Both Help Desk and DrScheme crash under Windows Mred 102/14.

The message is:

The instruction at 0x004224a1 referenced memory at 0x00d5c000.
The memory could not be read.

This may be a case of post hoc, ergo propter hoc, since
I had just rebuilt mred.exe for 102/14.  That is, DrScheme
and Help Desk may have crashed even if I hadn't removed
that directory.

>How-To-Repeat:
cvs update -r exp plt/src, plt/collects
recompile (Build All) mzscheme.exe
recompile (Build All) mred.exe
delete all .zo's, launchers
in rebuilt Mz, run (require-library "setup.ss" "setup")
run Help Desk or DrScheme

State-Changed-Why:
OK, the problem was that plt/collects/help was missing
on my machine.

But still, this should have caused a graceful error, rather
than a crash.

 I've exp-tagged a new plt/src/mred/mredmsw.cxx. Can you check whether
 it fixes the problems?
 
 Thanks,

 Apparently not.
 
 I rebuilt mred.exe (just with Build (F7), not a Rebuild All), 
 I saw the updated file compiling.  Then I mv'd
 my collects/help to collects/help.save.  Same result as before.

 Can you tell me where it crashes? (Is it line mredmsw.cxx line 229?)
