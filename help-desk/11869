>Description:
The "raco docs" command fails if a search argument is given. The command worked in version 5.1. The relevant change seems to be the addition of xdg-open as a possible way to launch a browser with a url; xdg-open attempts to check that the file exists, but it isn't smart enough to chop off the query suffix.
>How-To-Repeat:
~/projects/racket$ ./bin/raco docs syntax
Error showing url: Error stating file '/home/ryan/.racket/5.1.1.3/doc/search/index.html?q=syntax': No such file or directory
browser-run: process execute failed: '(#<path:/usr/bin/xdg-open> "file:///home/ryan/.racket/5.1.1.3/doc/search/index.html?q=syntax")


(The file '/home/ryan/.racket/5.1.1.3/doc/search/index.html' exists.)

 FYI: I got no message when this got moved to me.
 
 I have mentioned this before, but this is a good way for PRs to go
 into the bit bucket. I have a lot of PRs. I look at them, but I can't
 tell when new ones appear without an email.

 I noticed that this was filed strangely -- it looks like it was made
 up with you as the owner, and guessed that Ryan somehow used gnats
 directly to create the bug.

 Nothing so exotic.
 
 1. Filed the bug using DrRacket (notice all the nice environment 
 information).
 2. Set category to "Help Desk"
 3. Noticed that that put Robby as responsible, so went back and changed 
 the responsibility to Eli.
 
 I think we concluded that you don't get emails when you get assigned 
 responsibility implicitly because a bug's category was changed. I can't 
 change that; perhaps Eli can. I normally try to time bug triage right 
 before the weekly nag email so at least they'll show up then.
