Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 08 Aug 2006 21:12:05 -0400
Reason>>> Fixing

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 08 Aug 2006 21:12:05 -0400
Reason>>> The problem was that mrlib/info.ss specified a doc.txt file,
but the file wasn't there.  I fixed two things: first, Help
Desk will now show a red clear error message in such cases,
and second, I removed the bogus entry.  MrLib is documented
in a standalone manual now.
(Fixed in svn)
