>Description:
On Mac OS X, there is a long delay ( > 1 minute) with Internet Explorer trying to access 127.0.0.1/servlets/index.ss, main.ss, and perhaps some other URLs.

/servlets/home.ss shows in the MSIE address bar, and "sending request for /servlets/index.ss" shows in the status bar.

I think this delay is absent when logged into Mac OS X as the root user, but I didn't try it a second time to experiment.  I normally use DrScheme as a non-administrative user (not root, not the first user established when Mac OS X was installed).

>How-To-Repeat:
Click Help Desk from DrScheme menu
wait a long time
see PLT Help Desk page appear with no content
wait s shorter but noticeably long time
see search form and PLT Help Desk items appear.

 You're running Jaguar, right? Apple introduced a bug in Jaguar that
 causes this problem in help desk. We've managed to work around the bug
 for the next DrScheme release.
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew
