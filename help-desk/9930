>Description:
The search results are not obviously links, particular the black ones.

One of my students mentioned today that the entire semester they were annoyed that none of the results for "for" were useful. I opened up the page, typed for, and click on the first result. They were appalled that they never noticed it was clickable.

I understand that the attempt is to make syntax links consistently black across the whole system. Perhaps in the search results a display like:

for [BLUE](view docs)[/BLUE] provided from scheme/base, scheme

would be enough.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to http://docs.plt-scheme.org/search/index.html?q=for

The first result is black.

 Since it's all in CSS, it's very easy to fix it just for the search
 results.  But there are also similar contexts like the master index
 pages.  I'd much rather have it get a single uniform style instead.
