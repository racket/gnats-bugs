>Description:
The problem is that once you set the language to Beginner Student Language, and hit run to activate this, and then you start typing in the definitions window and hit F1 to call up the Help Desk, it calls up the Help Desk in some sort of restricted search mode in which it
only allows you to search on things related to the Beginner Student Language.  In this mode, nothing from Picturing Programs teachpack is findable, even if the Picturing Programs teachpack has been explicitly added to the installed teachpacks list, or required at the top of the definitions window.

 Bug is still present in a build I did a few hours ago from git.  To  
 refresh your memories, there's no trouble searching for picturing- 
 programs functions if I invoke the Help Desk from the menu, but  
 they're not found if I hit F1 (in BSL).  What code handles F1, and  
 how is it different from the Help Menu version?

 Correction: some time in the past few months, the behavior of F1 and the Help menu became consistent: now NEITHER of them can find picturing-programs functions until I hit "Clear/modify context".
 
 Is this likely to be a bug in my Scribble code?  Or in the code that invokes the Help Desk?

 Additional information: I ran DrRacket from the command line, and when I hit F1 I got the following in the terminal window:
 
 2011-12-02 06:40:05.121 osascript[21892:903] Error loading /Library/ScriptingAdditions/QXPScriptingAdditions.osax/Contents/MacOS/QXPScriptingAdditions:  dlopen(/Library/ScriptingAdditions/QXPScriptingAdditions.osax/Contents/MacOS/QXPScriptingAdditions, 262): no suitable image found.  Did find:

 osascript: OpenScripting.framework - scripting addition "/Library/ScriptingAdditions/QXPScriptingAdditions.osax" declares no loadable handlers.
 
 The same thing happened when I invoked "Help Desk" from the menu.
 
 Does that help?

 I think that probably something somewhere decides what the teaching
 student context is, and that context does not include your library.
 
 I am not sure where this resides, but I believe Eli maintains it.
 
 (Please keep "bugs@" in the cc line, in case someone comes back to
 look at this PR at a later date, so they can see the discussion.)

 The following is the patch that will add the picturing programs
 identifiers to all searches in the teaching languages.  I'll leave the
 committing to anyone who is willing to be responsible for that
 change...

 In the long run, I'd prefer a more general-purpose solution that searches whatever help files are associated with the "require"s from the most recent successful run.  But as a quick-and-dirty answer, that'll work.  Thanks.
