 The new version is 2.0.

 The problem is that the documentation in the planet package confuses
 help desk. I've fixed help desk in SVN, but in the meantime you might
 want to just uninstall that package:
 
 % planet -r soegaard web.plt 1 0
 
 It looks like there are other problems with this package
 possibly due to changes in the web server. Here's what I get when I install it
 
 [alishan] ~/svn/plt/collects/help% planet -i soegaard web.plt 1 0
 default-load-handler: cannot open input file:
 "/Users/robby/svn/plt/collects/web-server/response.ss" (No such file
 or directory; errno=2)
 setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for Web
 (/Users/robby/Library/PLT
 Scheme/planet/300/371/cache/soegaard/web.plt/1/0)
 setup-plt:   default-load-handler: cannot open input file:
 "/Users/robby/svn/plt/collects/web-server/response.ss" (No such file
 or directory; errno=2)
 
 Anyways, I've fixed Help Desk so that it a) doesn't die but just
 prints a message when it doesn't recognize the doc.txt file format and
 b) allows keywords in that position and indexes them.

 Rereading my message, I realize that I should qualify that -- Help
 Desk won't die in this particular case, but may still be broken in
 other cases ... :)
