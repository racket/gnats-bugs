>Description:
A problem with gui.ss and world.ss:
Since version 4.2. it is no longer possible to pass callback functions to "make-button" or "on-tick-event" or "on-key-esvent", that have been created by currying. Doing so, raises the error message: 
on-redraw: "procedure of one argument expected as on-redraw argument; given procedure of variable number of arguments", even if the curried function does except the correct number of arguments. This is a very hard restriction - because I like to use "gui.ss" and "world.s"s to teach high order functions, and in my class handouts I use "curry" frequently to construct the call back functions. 
Please, either change the implementation of "curry" to return only procedures with a fixed number of args or make the type-check in gui.ss and world.ss less strict.

By the way, the same problem occurs with the procedure "const".

Thank you for your attention.

Merry Christmas!

>How-To-Repeat:
; example: 

#lang scheme
(require htdp/world)
(require htdp/gui)
(require scheme/function)

(make-button "test" 
              (lambda (e)
                (display "test")))
; this is o.k.

(make-button "testCurry" 
              (curry (lambda (string event)
                (display string))
                     "test2" ) )
;this raises error:
;make-button: procedure of 1 argument expected as second argument; given ;procedure of variable number of arguments 

(big-bang 100 100 10 'world)
(on-key-event (lambda (a b) 1)); o.k.

(on-key-event (const 1));raises error:
;on-key-event: procedure of two arguments expected as ;on-key-event argument; given procedure of variable number of ;arguments

 Matthias: I think `check-proc' in `htdp/error' should use
 `procedure-arity-includes?' instead of comparing the result of
 `procedure-arity' to a number. I'm puzzled by the `>=' in the current
 implementation, though; it seems like it should be a `='.

 I am puzzled, too, and I can't recall at all why I changed =3D to >=3D .=20=
 
 
 So yes, I'll go with procedure-arity-includes?=20

Reason>>> changed procedure arity check in htdp/error, which should change the

the following now run: 

#lang scheme

(require htdp/image)
(require htdp/gui)

(make-button "test" (lambda (e) (display "test")))

(make-button "testCurry" (curry (lambda (string event) (display string)) 
"test2"))

(big-bang 10 
          (on-key (const 1)) 
          (on-draw (lambda (x) (text (number->string x) 11 'black))))

(note that world.ss is deprecated and will disappear in the next release)

 Thank you, Mattias,
 for the quick solution.
