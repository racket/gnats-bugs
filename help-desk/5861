>Description:
I have a problem using Help Desk when not connected to the
Internet. Pages load very slowly, with Internet Explorer
(v5) spending ages looking for Proxy Servers. Also I keep
getting dialogs telling me that I do not have an Internet
connection. However, when I click the Retry button
the browser starts searching for Proxies and eventually 
loads the page. This problem seemed to start after I enabled
the on-board Lan adapter on my machine. The Lan is working
fine and so is my Internet connection, but there appears to
be some sort of problem with my network configuration as far
as Help Desk is concerned. Any suggestions?

 You can tell IE not to use a proxy server for the IP address
 "127.0.0.1".  That should prevent the proxy lookups for Help Desk.
