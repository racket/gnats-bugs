 In a related note, do either of you know why there is a keywords.scm
 file included in the mred-doc.plt file?

 There seems to be one in other directories, too. I think it's an
 intermediate product of the build that isn't supposed to be
 distributed.

 Well, I didn't actually think of checking. I was just interested in
 documentation for `draw-bitmap' on a machine with a fresh install.

 There is a step that copies files into a directory in preparation for
 making a .plt file. I believe it used to be called copy-clean-html or
 something similar.

 (I don't know which of the scripts is responsible for cleaning these
 things up -- it's part of the iplt/doc mess...)
