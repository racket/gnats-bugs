>Description:
Since it is likely that the help-desk web-browser window will obscure
DrScheme's windows, it would be nice to have a button to return to
DrScheme, rather than having to re-select it via the Finder/Desktop/Dock.

 This is a more general problem than just help desk and DrScheme, I'd
 say. 
 
 I use a program called "LiteSwitch X" (available at
 http://www.versiontracker.com/).
 
 Let me know if that helps.

 Thanks, a very nice utility; but still curious as to if it is reasonably
 possible to switch apps via a button push in the help-desk window frame in
 a cross-platform way?

 Not in a cross platform way, no. But perhaps we can do it in a
 platform-specific way (one for each platform), just like we currently
 go from DrScheme to the web browser in a platform-specific way.

 We could have DrScheme register a procedure with the Help Desk server
 that when called would set the focus to DrScheme.
 
 Robby, do-able?

 That's the easy part. The hard part is that DrScheme cannot bring
 itself to the front in a platform-independent way. I'm not sure it's
 worth the effort (esp. since we already have lots of trouble binging a
 browser window to the front and this would be harder....)
