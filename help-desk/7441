>Description:
The order of results form searching the help disk is unhelpful.  Ideally something like google would be used to rank results.  However, a much quicker and acceptable fix is just to list results in a logical order based on which part of the help pages they come from.  For example, list results from t-y-scheme first, then ones from PLT MzScheme: Language Manual, and then from PLT MzLib: Libraries Manual, and so forth. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to help desk and search for list.  The results under language "PLAI - Pretty Big" are from the following parts of help pages in this order:

t-y-scheme
SRFI documents inside PLT
Inside PLT MzScheme
PLT Framework: GUI Application Framework
PLT MrEd: Graphical Toolbox Manual
PLT MzLib: Libraries Manual
PLT DrScheme: Programming Environment Manual
PLT MzScheme: Language Manual
Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
Beginning Student Language
PLT Tools: DrScheme Extension Manual
PLT Help Desk
.
.
.

Note that the results for Inside PLT MzScheme (something for which very few users are looking) is listed before PLT MzScheme: Language Manual (something many would love to find).

 They also appear in reverse order from where they appear in the files  
 they appear in. Often causing results to be in the order of most- 
 specific to least-specific. Try searching on 'exn:' and you'll get a  
 backwards list of the possible exceptions.
