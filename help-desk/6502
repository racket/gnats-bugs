>Description:
occasonally, "refresh all manuals" hangs whild downloading new copies,
but can't seem to issolate the behavior, as it seem to hang randomly
while downloading from 1 to N manuals, if all manuals are downloaded
everything then proceeds as expected; seems like some thread and/or
networking traffic delay sensivity/abnormality? (when it occurs, I abort,
and try again until it works, which it eventually does.)

 seems to occur more often if all DrScheme windows except the "installer
 progress" window are closed after initiating "refresh all manuals", and
 and/or then bringing a different application window to the front (i.e.
 the "installer progress" window not being front most).

 All seems to have been fine for the past few days for what that's worth, if
 it happens again, I'll try to be more specific.
