Does not find 'UTF-16' in 3.6 either. (this only finds entries in Foreign interface manual)

 Second thoughts - this probably is not a bug - it is probably just how
 the help-desk search works. A design choice that is not necessarily
 wrong.

 Hi Stephen,

  > a search does not find it.
 
 The HelpDesk can actually do a full text search. In the bottom
 left corner of the HelpDesk window there is a drop-down menu.
 If you choose "Keyword, index, or text" it will search the full
 text of all documents - and not just the handpicked keywords.
 
 In this case 'platform-UTF-16' is found 8 times.
