 The problem seems to be that you are treating a slash-delimited url as
 a filename, but a slash-delimited url isn't a filename in all
 filesystems. You have to roll your own functions that split up the path
 based on the slashes, rather than using the built in filesystem
 utilities.

 BTW, the offending source location is in results.ss, line 149, I believe.
