>Description:
If one tries to bind a variable from an import in a compound unit to a link, it generates an internal error:
Example:
(define A (unit (import a)
		(export c)
		(define c (lambda () a))))

(define B (compound-unit (import x)
			 (link (AT (A x)))
			 (export (AT c))))

If x is replaced in the link with another variable exported by a second unit, as in
(define C (unit (import)
		(export x)
		(define x 5)))

(define NewB (compound-unit (import)
			    (link (AT (A (CT x)))
				  (CT (C)))
			    (export (AT c))))

The error is no longer there
>How-To-Repeat:
(define A (unit (import a)
		(export c)
		(define c (lambda () a))))

(define B (compound-unit (import x)
			 (link (AT (A x)))
			 (export (AT c))))

Responsible-Changed-When: Wed May 13 11:36:26 1998
Responsible-Changed-Why:
This error only occurs when the "trap uses of undefined value" flag is 
on.  Therefore it must be a code generation problem.

State-Changed-When: Wed May 13 11:56:41 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This bug was fixed some time back, but I guess the code didn't make it 
into the released version.  Grrr.
