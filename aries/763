                             ^^^^^^^
context expected 1 value, received 2 values: 1 2

The (^^^^^) expression is highlighted, rather than the (values ...)
expression
>Fix:

There are two fixes.

1) wrap each subexpression, E, of an applications with 
    (begin0 E (set-box! aries-box ...))

2) wait for John to implement the improved error reporting that uses
with-continuation-mark.

Since this bug only shows up when a non-application returns multiple
values, I plan to just go with 2)
