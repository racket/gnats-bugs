>Description:
When I attempted to use the arrow.ss teachpack at the end
of problem 10.3.6, it gave me an error even though my 
functions worked correctly.  When I switched the parameters
of the function it worked correctly.  The book has the 
function take a number 1st, then the list of shapes, but
the teackpack requires the list to be first.

 are you using the teachpacks from www.htdp.org or are you using the
 teachpacks that came with the original package? -- matthias

 Sorry for the huge delay in my response. I was swamped. I have just run the
 test code from the teachpack's documentation (see help desk, keyword
 "arrow.ss"). The code works just fine, and matches the specs in the book: 
 
  move takes a number first, then a shape. please run this code. 
 
 If you disagree, pls send me your code. Thanks -- Matthias
 
 
 
 ;; A shape is a structure: 
 ;;   (make-posn num num)
 
 ;; RAD : the radius of the simple disk moving across a canvas
 (define RAD 10)
 
 ;; move : number shape -> shape or false 
 ;; to move a shape by delta according to translate 
 ;; effect: to redraw it 
 (define (move delta sh)
   (cond
     [(and (clear-solid-disk sh RAD)
           (draw-solid-disk (translate sh delta) RAD))
      (translate sh delta)]
     [else false]))
 
 ;; translate : shape number -> shape 
 ;; to translate a shape by delta in the x direction 
 (define (translate sh delta)
   (make-posn (+ (posn-x sh) delta) (posn-y sh)))
 
 ;; draw-it : shape -> true
 ;; to draw a shape on the canvas: a disk with radius
 (define (draw-it sh)
   (draw-solid-disk sh RAD))
 
 ;; TESTS: 
 
 ;; this creates the canvas
 (start 100 50)
 
 ;; this creates the controller GUI
 (control-left-right (make-posn 10 20) 10 move draw-it)
