 Shriram says: 
 
 Q3: I would reword the error:
 
  big-bang: on-brain is not a valid name for a handler
 
 The problem with "... clauses are not allowed in ..." is that it
 suggests the clauses are allowed, just somewhere else, so now the user
 has two problems: what do I write in here, and in what setting can I
 write this? That's clearly not your intent.

 "big-bang: the allowed handler names are: ...,...,..,..,.." perhaps sorted
 in edit distance from the one actually written there? And just rely on
 source code highlighting for them to find the existing one (if you call
 raise-syntax-error properly, it will be stuck on the end in the form of "in
 X" and you don't need to put it into the exact call.

 Or maybe something like git's error?
 
 % git duff
 git: 'duff' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
 
 Did you mean this?
