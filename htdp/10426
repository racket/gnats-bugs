 Right now I'm using the latests version (4.2.1) as installed on the Brown CS
 dept and I just updated my personal machine and it's having the same
 problem.
 
 To be specific, I set the language to module with full scheme, then put one
 line into the definitions window: (require 2htdp/universe) and hit run. In
 the REPL I just type image? and it gives a "reference to an identifier
 before its definition: image?" error.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ethan

 The fix is in the 'svn head' of course, not in the released version.  
 The next release is scheduled for this month and things will change  
 then.
