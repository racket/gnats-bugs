>Description:
If I load image and universe through require statements then execute place-image (whether in repl or interactions), the scene frame is missing the lower and right edges.  Problem does not occur if I load image and universe as teachpacks.

Also, am surprised that universe doesn't load image automatically -- should I be?

This is version 5.0[3m], running on XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Put following in interactions window:

(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)
(place-image (circle 10 "solid" "red") 50 50
            (empty-scene 200 200)) 

2. Run.  The bottom and right edges of the scene frame are missing.  

3. Comment out the requires and load the image and universe teachpacks instead.  Frame draws normally.

 Believe it or not, this is actually explained in the documentation. I
 would welcome a better way to do this; I don't really see one yet.
 
 See this, plus the point that the image is cropped when it is drawn in
 the REPL (to its bounding box)
 
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html?q=3D2htdp/image#%28pa=
 rt._nitty-gritty%29
 
 I would really welcome your thoughts on a different way to do this.
 I've thought thru a bunch of alternatives, but not found one better.
 Maybe your thoughts can spark a new way to look at it that'll help?

 Oh -- this could be a windows-only problem somehow. That's possible.
 
 Now that you say that, I recall that I add one to the bounding box (or
 at least I think I did) when cropping the REPL for precisely this
 issue.

 At first I thought that Kathi was complaining about this problem, but =
 look at how to repeat. When you run it on a Mac, you do see the two =

 Not sure what "the menu" means if not "the teachpacks".  I tried once
 through the usual teachpack interface, and once by explicitly putting
 the requires in my file.  I thought the front page of 2E was
 suggesting we should use the requires, though I was surprised that
 this is considered better than teachpacks as an interface for novices.
 
 Incidentally, the framing problem I reported also happens when running
 the simulation through big-bang -- not a problem when using
 teachpacks, is a problem when using requires.

 The teachpacks menu points to the htdp teachpacks only.=20
 
 To get the 2htdp teachpacks via the menu, you need to explicitly add =
 them first via the file menu and the run from there.=20
 
 Yes, we will go to require mode. It isn't as beginner friendly as the =
 menu but I think it is the right way to go. What I am hoping for is that =
 we will have a menu that inserts the appropriate text for beginners, =
 especially young ones who have trouble typing (middle school).=20
