>Description:
When I have selected Beginning Student Language and I save my program as a file, the file stores my choice of language, and when I reload the file, the proper language is selected.  However, when my student submits that same file through the handin server, the "GRacket editor format" does not preserve the choice of language, and when I open the submitted file I get a "No language chosen" error.

I believe that submission through the handin server ought to preserve the choice.

1. Set up handin server and client

 I think this might be made to work if the handin-server were to use the
 save-port method instead of getting the text directly out of the editor.
 
 The issue is that this memory of the language that you're seeing in
 drracket happens because drracket doesn't save what you see in the file: it
 saves what amounts to a secret hidden first line: "#lang htdp/bsl" (or
 whatever: it doesn't actually look like that, but that's for technical and
 historical reasons). Then, when it sees that secret line, it recognizes it
 and hides that secret line again after opening the file.
 
 So if the handin server were to play along by "saving" the file and then
 taking that data and uploading it, things might work like Norman asks.
 
 I wouldn't recommend turning this on by default, tho.

 As a side-note, it will also make it lose some information in the
 coloring and stuff like that.  Saving it this way is something that
 was there years ago (including saving the interactions window), and I
 think that nobody uses it any more.

 Why not?  Under what circumstances would you want a student to "handin" =
 an assignment and not know what language the student wrote it in?
 
 If this were "turned on by default", student code would by default run =
 in the same language the student wrote it in, but you'd still be able to =
 manually override the language.  Are there existing workflows that =
 depend (without a manual override) on running student code in a =
 different language from what the student was writing?
 
 
 In the long run, I think it would be best to treat the #lang line =
 uniformly.  No matter what language you're in, DrRacket shows you what =
 language it is (perhaps in a small separate pane), and provides you with =
 a uniform way of changing it.  If somebody edits the file with vi and =
 changes the #lang line, the next time you open it in DrRacket, the new =
 contents of that line show up in the "language" pane.  If somebody edits =
 the file with vi and deletes the #lang line, the next time you open it =
 in DrRacket, it complains of an ill-formed file and offers a reasonable =
 default choice, which it inserts into the file.

 Yes, agreed.

 &gt; The issue is that this memory of the language that you&#39;re seeing i=
 n drracket happens because drracket doesn&#39;t save what you see in the fi=
 le: it saves what amounts to a secret hidden first line: &quot;#lang htdp/b=
 sl&quot; (or whatever: it doesn&#39;t actually look like that, but that&#39=
 ;s for technical and historical reasons). Then, when it sees that secret li=
 ne, it recognizes it and hides that secret line again after opening the fil=
 e.<br>
 
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; So if the handin server were to play along by &quot;saving&quot; the f=
 ile and then taking that data and uploading it, things might work like Norm=

 If this were &quot;turned on by default&quot;, student code would by defaul=

 In the long run, I think it would be best to treat the #lang line uniformly=
