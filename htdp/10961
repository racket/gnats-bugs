In case I haven't formally bug-reported this yet...
I would really like for 2htdp/image to support reflection as well as rotation, scaling, etc.  This week I've been searching out references to reflection in my textbook and replacing them with other things, but sometimes reflection really is the pedagogically right thing to use.  (For example, "is rotate-180 the same thing as reflect-vert?  Is it the same thing as reflect-horiz?  How does it differ from each?  How does it resemble each?")

I could cobble together a reflection function myself if I had a convenient way to flatten a 2htdp/image into a bitmap, but then it wouldn't scale or rotate nicely; it would be better to simply include reflection among the variants of the image tree type.

 I am officially Not Nagging :-) but it would help me plan my textbook- 
 writing if I had an estimate as to when (and whether) reflection is  
 likely to be added to 2htdp/image .  If it's likely to be in the  
 August release, for example, I won't bother taking it out of the  
 textbook; as soon as I hear that it's been implemented, I'll test my  
 teachpack on it and wrap up the book.  OTOH, if it's likely to take  
 longer than that, I'll remove all references to reflection from the  
 textbook and send it to the publisher in June or July.

 I have a deadline of Wed that I'm pretty much completely focused on,
 but if you were to send a similar message to me on Thursday or Friday,
 there is a pretty good chance it would prompt to actually give it a
 try on those days and then we'd have a very good idea if it would make
 it into the August release or not.
 
 (Sorry it has taken me this long.)
