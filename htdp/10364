Computer Language: (("Teaching Languages" "How to Design Programs" "Beginning Student") (#(#t constructor repeating-decimal #f #t none) #f ((lib "foo.ss" "installed-teachpacks"))))
>Description:
If teachpack foo.ss exports a higher-order primitive via 
provide-higher-order-primitive and program bar.ss imports
it in BSL, check syntax cannot find the binding connection 
between a use of an argument to the primitive and its def. 
Renaming doesn't work either. 

It all works if you use Module for bar.ss. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Use foo and bar below, run bar to see it work, check syntax, 
try to rename f to g. 

bar.ss: 
;; use teachpack foo.ss
(define (f x) (+ 1 x))
(hofun f)

foo.ss: 
#lang scheme
(require lang/prim)
(provide-higher-order-primitive hofun (f))
(define (hofun f)(printf "~s ~s ~s\n" (f 1) (f 2) (f 3)))

Reason>>> This must have been fixed a while ago. [[ I am not responsible for check syntax. 
I just submitted the bug.]]
