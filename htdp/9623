>Description:
Notes from our workshop about world documentation:

- the defn of scene starts off with lambda, which is unknown to most folks (students or teachers) when they first encounter world.

- the notation summarizing the types of args to world function seems to use the format (-> in1 ... out).  That is throwing off participants used to seeing contracts where -> separates inputs from outputs.

 Fixed as follows and checked into svn:
 "
 
 Scene
 
    (define (focus-at-0-0 i)
 
      (and (= (pinhole-x i) 0) (= (pinhole-y i) 0)))
 
    (and/c image? focus-at-0-0)
 
 "
 
 (I must admit that I was hoping that people would read the text that  
 follows this contract:
 
   "The teachpack can display only Scenes, which are images whose  
 pinholes are at position (0 ,0)."
 
 and that the lambda would just tickle their curiosity.)

 Higher-order functions are rendered that way via scribble. Again, I  
 am hoping that this small change doesn't throw off people. (My  
 students seem to have no problem with this at NU.)

 As we move towards using world with younger students and less
 experienced instructors, I expect this to be more of an issue.  The
 current docs are just overwhelming enough that I'm reluctant to point
 novices towards helpdesk for info on using world.ss.  This bug report
 originated from comments from Lon Levy at the workshop, and he
 reported that his high school students were having a lot of trouble
 understanding the world docs.

 Yes, the docs aren't intended for high school students and younger  
 kids. And yes, they are a stretch for college students in the first  
 few weeks. I do write additional material into the problem statements  
 and that may explain why we're not seeing too many complaints up here.
 
 What we do need -- and soon -- are write-ups that introduce world  
 gently.
 
 The damn HtDC stuff has just eaten too much of my life.
