>Description:
It's probably considered a bug that #(1 2 3) reads to an immutable vector in ASL. (Technically: #(1 2 3) should read to something that expands to something that evaluates to a new vector with 1 2 3)

AFAIK, that's the only way to construct an immutable? thing in ASL when a mutable version exists.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define v #(1))
(vector-set! v 1 2)
