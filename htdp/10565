 Do you mean this in 2.3.8.4:
 
 The protocol tells us that add-world just adds the given world =20
 structure =96 recall that this a data representation of the actual world =
 =20
 program =96 to the given list of worlds. It then sends a message to the =20=
 
 first world on this list to get things going:
 
    (define (add-world univ state wrld)
      (local ((define univ* (append univ (list wrld))))
        (make-bundle univ*
                     (list (make-mail (first univ*) 'it-is-your-turn))
                     '())))
 
 The 'state' part is wrong.
 
 If so, fixed and checked in. -- Matthias
