>Description:
I'm not sure whether this is a doc bug or a software bug.  The doc says the scaling factors are real?, so a negative number should be legal.  And it doesn't produce any error messages, but when I scale something by a negative factor, I get a blank image with a negative image-width and/or image-height.

I propose that the right answer is to reflect in the appropriate dimension(s) and scale by the absolute value(s) of the factor(s).

 Perhaps in mred v2, I'll be able to do that, but for now, I'll
 probably just make it an error (ie, the contract is wrong).

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by robby at Wed, 17 Feb 2010 18:07:50 -0500
Reason>>> rbf


State changed from "open" to "closed" by dyoo at Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:44:36 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed a long time ago, I think.  The current contract for scale/xy requires 
positive reals, so this was a software bug.
