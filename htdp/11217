>Description:
Check Syntax doesn't pick up names in contract definitions.  As a result, using the Rename tool on a syntactically correct program doesn't take you to another syntactically correct program, but instead leads to a contract error.
>How-To-Repeat:
(: foo (Number -> Number))
(define (foo x) x)

Check Syntax, Rename foo to bar, but foo remains unchanged in the contract.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "matthias" to "robby" by matthias at Thu, 30 Sep 2010 14:11:49 -0400
Reason>>> (this is something Robby should look at first)


Responsible changed from "robby" to "shriram" by robby at Tue, 30 Nov 2010 11:03:33 -0500
Reason>>> Sorry -- this is for the maintainer of ASL. Me, as
maintainer of Check Syntax needs a smaller example to do
something useful with. I think the ASL maintainer's job is
to produce that example. (Much like Casey has done with Redex.)


Responsible changed from "shriram" to "nobody" by samth at Sun, 09 Jun 2013 14:27:29 -0400
