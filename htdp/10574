>Description:
Rotating an image composed of overlay'ed rotated ellipses produces the wrong
images.  In particular, the "frames" are in the right places, but the
ellipses are drawn somewhere else entirely. Rectangles work fine.

This looks to me like an x and a y coordinate are getting swapped, somewhere.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/image)

(rotate 30
        (overlay
         (frame (rotate 30 (ellipse 100 10 "solid" "red")))
         (frame (ellipse 100 10 "solid" "blue"))))

 Somehow I didn't even see this PR until now!
 
 Turns out it wasn't a simple x/y swap, but I was just doing things
 wrong in a more fundamental way.
