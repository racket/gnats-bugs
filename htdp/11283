>Description:
If you forget to put a function value (or special form) after a left paren, in BSL the error message is "function call: expected a defined name or a primitive operation name after an open parenthesis, but found something else", but this is incorrect.  It is expecting a defined *function* name or a primitive operation name.

This is most confusing when the first element inside parens is a variable containing a non-function value, because the beginner student notes that the variable is, in fact, a defined name, and thus isn't sure what the compiler is asking for.
>How-To-Repeat:
* Set language to "Beginner Student" (with or without abbrev)
* Type

(define x 3)
(* (x 2))

* Click "Run".
