>Description:
This one is really wild.  Line 6 of this file produces a correct answer if line 7 is not commented out, but an incorrect (un-flipped) answer if line 7 is commented out.  Line 8 starts an animation which never actually changes, but if line 7 isn't commented out, line 8 starts with the wrong initial image.

The exact same examples with flip-vertical replaced with flip-horizontal all work correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)
(define pic  .) ; insert your favorite asymmetrical bitmap picture
(flip-vertical (place-image pic 50 50 (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "yellow"))) ; works
(define blah (place-image pic 50 50 (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "yellow")))
(flip-vertical blah) ; works
(big-bang pic (on-tick flip-vertical 1) (on-draw (lambda (x) x))) ; flips once, but not a second time
(big-bang blah (on-tick flip-vertical 1) (on-draw (lambda (x) x))) ; starts out flipped (which blah shouldn't be!), and never flips again

 In the pre-release I see a problem with the flipped bitmap in the
 yellow-background case (it seems to lose its alpha channel) but I do
 see flipping.
 
 If you have a chance to double check this on your machine, that would be a =
 help.
