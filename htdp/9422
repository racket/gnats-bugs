 Did you mean to close this PR? Your comment suggests not.
 
 Also: this library is designed for students who, when passing an empty
 string to text, are likely making a mistake and, even worse, will be
 confused when their image is empty.
 
 So, I don't yet agree with this reasoning.

 I had an example file where the program printed out the text typed
 into the window so far.  It died on the empty string.  Is that
 inappropriate for students, or should we allow it?

 If you've got a list of chars and you're turning them into a string
 and then turning that into an image I see how you could make this
 error.
 
 But it also seems reasonable for students to have to think about the
 emty case, realize they dont' want to draw anything and then not draw
 anything.

 BTW, does the closure of the PR mean that you've changed the code? And
 the docs and the test suite? Or does it mean that you've decided this
 is a non bug?

 How do you "not draw anything" in a function whose contract is World
 -> Image?  Or, how is (text "" 10 'red) different from not drawing
 anything?

 You need to return an empty image. Or an image that include whatever
 is around in the window that's not what's being typed.
 
 But you already know that.
 
 I think I'm done with this conversation.

 Right -- it seems like one would want to add a test case for the empty
 string after changing the behavior of the empty string.
 
 I'm not sure what that error in the test suite is, but I think your
 interpretation is right. I'll try to look into it after you finish.

 You are correct. I expected to find a test case (exn) for (text  
 "" ...) but didn't. I guess I'll add one ...

 (Ditto for the docs -- they shoudl have specified this too.)

  From my preliminary investigations, the error is triggered by  
 something inside of image-inside because each subexpression alone  
 evaluates just fine.

 Possibly image-inside? assumes all non-empty images.
 
 I guess the right fix is to make image-inside? just return #t when
 given an empty image (as a special case).
 
 Thanks for checking into that. I suspect there might be other problems
 with zero-sized images. (Possibly: returning them at the REPL)
 
 Note taht Steve has long been asking for zero-sized images, so it
 might be worth trying to dig up the PRs that he submitted, while
 you're working on that.
 
 Or, if you want, you can hand this over to me now. I should have time
 today to get to it.

 Okay, I am handing it over to you. Here is where the error is raised:

 Two remarks:
 
 1. I should have trusted the contract system. It would have saved me  
 between 3 and 5 minutes. :-]
 
 2. The above code is just beyond my 'fluid' expertise. So we're  
 better off if you spend time on the 0-sized images and I spend time  
 on Redex.

 I did trust it and that's how I was pretty sure I already knew where
 the bug was and what was going on.

 The docs are in collects/teachpack/htdp/scribblings/
 
 (They were allowing 0-length strings until now.)
