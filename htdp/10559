>How-To-Repeat:
l-m-w needs to deal with each expression as a thread.

Yup.
 
Technically it wraps them as thunks and passes them to a function that does the rest of the work. In ISL+ and below -- where universe.ss is used -- it is impossible to express thunks (there's no linguistic form).  For ASL, I could expose the function.

That's pretty much what I figured.  It just seemed like starting up these threads programmatically was a natural thing to want.

Now that I'm awake, here are a couple of ideas.  How about

lmw : [X -> IWorld] -> [Listof X] -> [Listof IWorld]
eg
(lmw make-player (list "mitch" "sam" "carl"))

or just fake the thunk with a dummy argument:

lmw : [Listof [Any -> IWorld]] -> [List IWorld]
eg
(define (make-mitch dummy) (make-player "mitch" 100))
(define (make-carl dummy)    (make-player "carl" 200))
(lmw (list make-mitch make-carl))

This has the additional benefit of forcing the student to create a list of functions.
