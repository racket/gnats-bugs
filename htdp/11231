>Description:
Description of "overlay/xy" in Help Desk is wrong. This is especially problematic because it's the first place that the reader of HtDP/2e is asked to visit.

Description:
(overlay/xy i1 x y i2) â†’ image?
Constructs an image by overlaying i1 on top of i2 after shifting i2 over by x pixels to the right and y pixels down. 

Actual behavior:
Constructs an image by overlaying i2 on top of i1 after shifting i2 over by x pixels to the right and y pixels down. 


>How-To-Repeat:
Run this:

(overlay/xy (rectangle 20 20 "solid" "red")
                5 5
                (rectangle 20 20 "solid" "black"))

You will find the black rectangle (square) on top of the red one, not vice versa.

 Are you sure you're not mixing up the two image libraries?
 
 There's 2htdp/image and htdp/image. The latter is the only one that
 you see in the "add teachpack..." menu (altho that is going to change
 for the next release) and the latter is the one that behaves as you've
 quoted.

 It could well be that I'm using htdp/image, but that's because I followed t=

 Alan, you're right, the current situation is a bit confusing.  It's
 too easy to do the wrong thing, which I think is what you're berating
 us about.  We've been having an internal discussion about cleaning
 this up, and I believe Robby has already committed some code to the
 internal version to make clear there are multiple editions of
 Teachpacks like image.
 
 Are you set for now, or are you having trouble writing some particular
 program because of the confusion?

 Thank you for asking. It's nice to get responses from not just one but two 
 authors when I file a bug report! Yes, I've figured out how to call the right 
 library. However, I posted a note to our course's discussion board to flag the 
 issue in case anyone else gets stuck.
 
 Best wishes,
 Alan

 Yes, putting a note is probably a good idea.  I do something similar
 in my course, where I provide a Teachpack that just includes the right
 libraries automatically.  Either way, the interface will be clearer in
 the future.
