>Description:
The Help Desk documentation for place-image gives this as an example:

(place-image
     (triangle 64 "solid" "red")
     24 24
     (rectangle 48 48 "solid" "gray"))

But that code generates this error message:

place-image: expected <scene> as fourth argument, given: "image with pinhole at (24,24)"

Apparently, something like this is expected:

(place-image
     (triangle 64 "solid" "red")
     24 24
     (empty-scene 48 48))

This is one of the earliest examples cited in HtDP/2e, so it is especially disorienting.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type in the following code from the documentation:

(place-image
     (triangle 64 "solid" "red")
     24 24
     (rectangle 48 48 "solid" "gray"))

 I think this is the same problem as your earlier pr.
