>Description:
Under the "question-and-answer-game", "Data Analysis and
Definition" dialog, sixth item:

"Does some data collection consist of disjoint subsest?"
                                               ^^^^^^^^
Should probably be:

"Does some data collection consist of disjoint subsets?"
                                               ^^^^^^^^

>How-To-Repeat:
From the Help Desk, select Design Recipes, expand the
"Does the problem statement suggest a process? ..." item,
and click on the "question-and-answer game" link.  Follow
links to the above mentioned tag.
