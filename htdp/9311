>Description:
htdp teaching language, 

The following should fail because make-color is applied to inappropriate arguments, but it doesn't: 

(make-color .1 2 3)

The next expression does fail and blames the make-color expression: 

(circle 10 'solid (make-color .1 2 3))

A 'clever' student should be able to lift out the expression that's blamed and study the error in isolation.
