>Description:
This is different from my earlier request about require syntax.

It would be nice if a student-language program could "require" another student-language program in the same directory.  At present, it doesn't work because "provide" isn't in the student languages.  One solution would be to put an implicit "(provide (all-defined-out))" on any file in a student language.  Another, of course, would be to enable "provide" for real.  I think I would vote for the former solution.
>How-To-Repeat:
foo-list.ss:
(require "foo.ss")
(define blah (list (make-foo 3 4) (make-foo 5 6)))

foo.ss:
(define-struct foo (b c))
(provide (all-defined-out))
; If this line is missing, foo-list.ss fails a syntax check.
; If it's present, foo.ss fails a syntax check in the
; student languages, although it's fine if foo.ss is in
; #lang racket.

 Any progress on this?  It strikes me that writing your own library which you can re-use for later tasks is a Big Idea that we should encourage students to learn early.
 
 As a reminder, I'm suggesting that there be an implicit "provide all-defined-out" in every *SL program, so they can be invoked from other *SL programs.

 I would like this also.
 
 For my purposes (MSCS students), I'd be happy with simply providing
 "provide" -- this would probably be very simple to change (right?)
 
 But an implicit (provide (all-defined-out))would work fine, too.
 
 As it is, when my students are using the student languages, I have them add
 a file
 
 provide.rkt:
 #lang racket
 (provide provide)
 
 in their homework directory, and then say
 
 (require "provide.rkt")
 
 in their homework file.
 
 I'm hoping this email will add me as an "interested party" so I can follow
 this bug.
 
 Also, it shows as "analyzed" in the database.  What does that mean?
