>How-To-Repeat:
set beginner language plus draw.ss 

hit execute, get error message
expand: unbound variable in module

i'll upload a screen shot if necessary
>Fix:
this was an omission -- I didn't finish converting drscheme's repl to
use module.

 Yes, sorry. I know about this. I've moved programs to be implicitly in
 modules and didn't finish. I'll try to get to it soon.
