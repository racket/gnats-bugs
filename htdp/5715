>Description:
In v201, there's a file

  plt/collects/doc/teachpack/pingp.html

Apparently, this teachpack no longer exists.
The teachpack doc-builder, plt/teachpack/Docs/mkdocs
does not clean out old files, so this leaked into 
the distribution.

The v201 Tour has a link to this documentation.
Even though the HTML exists, the link fails, because 
it's not in the (correct) index file, 
plt/collects/doc/teachpack/hdindex.

So two things need fixing:

 - the mkdocs script
 - the Tour should link to a different teachpack
>How-To-Repeat:
Look in the v201 Tour, find the Teachpacks page, click 
on the "ping-pong game" link.

 I have changed the link from ping-pong to Mastermind.  New
 iplt/doc/tour.ss committed.
 
 Paul, do you think you could verify that this works without error?
 
 Thanks,
 Shriram

 Latter done; presumably the former is Paul's task.
