 This is by design.
 
 Please use empty-scene, not rectangle for place-image.
 
 If you really want to know what is going on, you must read this
 section of the docs:
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/teachpack/2htdpimage.html#(part._nit=
 ty-gritty)
 
 (sorry that's only in the pre-release version of the docs for now).

 FWIW, I think the easiest way to set that up would be to make the
 overall background be one pixel bigger than you've got it, to cover
 the overhanging rectangles.
 
 Of course, if you think the primitives should be different somehow,
 I'm all ears (as is Ian, I expect).

 Ok, thanks for the tip.  I haven't given the interface nearly the thought=
  you guys have, so I'll run with what you've provided (which is a nice st=
 ep up from last year's, btw) and reserve judgement/comments for later.  T=
 hx again.
