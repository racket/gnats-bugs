>Description:
On cyclic lists, first and rest return errors (arguably they should not), but in the current implementation second ... eighth do not.

(As a separate matter, ninth and tenth are defined in Racket but not in ASL.)
>How-To-Repeat:
(define web-colors
 (shared ([W (cons "white" G)]
          [G (cons "grey" W)])
   W))
(check-error (first web-colors))
(check-error (rest web-colors))
(check-expect (second web-colors) "grey")
(check-expect (third web-colors) "white")
(check-expect (eighth web-colors) "grey")
