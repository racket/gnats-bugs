>Description:
The documentation for 4.2.5, section 2.7.1.2 Images, says the image% class responds to messages get-w, get-h, get-dx, and get-dy.  In fact, when I try any of those, I get
"send: no such method: get-dx for class: image%"

Are there two different image% classes running around in the standard bundle?

 Can you send a long a more complete program, please? (Preferably a small on=
 e.)
 
 Thanks,

 Yes, two different libraries. And, just to note, when you require a
 private/ library you are relying on undocumented, subject-to-change
 behavior.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by robby at Tue, 20 Apr 2010 13:08:40 -0400
Reason>>> rbf

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 20 Apr 2010 13:08:40 -0400
Reason>>> not a bug (the confusion came from using a private library
in htdp/ and expecting it to be the same as some other
public library)
