>Description:
In Dr. Racket 5.1.3 running on Debian Wheezy 64-bit, (overlay i1 i2 is ...) exhibits behavior different from that described in the documentation for HtDP 2e teachpack images.ss. According to 2.2.3 Overlaying Images, the first argument overlays the 2nd, and so on. What actually happens is the 2nd argument overlays the 1st.
>How-To-Repeat:
(overlay (circle 5 "solid" "red") 
   (rectangle 20 20 "solid" "blue"))

should show a red circle on top of a blue square, but it in fact just shows a blue square. To get the red circle to appear, it must appear as the SECOND argument:

(overlay (rectangle 20 20 "solid" "blue")
   (circle 5 "solid" "red"))

 There are actually two different overlay functions, one in the
 htdp/image and one 2htdp/image and they do opposite things with
 overlay's ordering.
 
 Is it possible you're reading the docs for one and using the other one?

 I think you've found the right documentation (you see the first
 example on top of the others in the examples, right? Those results are
 generated by actually evaluating the code and rendering the results).
 Also, section 2.2.3 is the the section containing overlay in the HtDP
 2e image library's documentation.
 
 So maybe you ended up with HtDP/1e's overlay accidentally?
 
 I'm not sure how you're using the 2htdp/image teachpack (there are
 multiple ways). If you are usingthe teachpack menu, try putting this
 at the beginning of the file instead (you will probably need to
 "clear" your teachpacks from the "teachpack" menu first):
 
 (require 2htdp/image)
 
 If you're already doing that, then perhaps the thing to do is to send
 the entire file you're running. Maybe there's something else going on
 that I'm not seeing.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yeah, it is confusing. :(
 
 I'm glad you got it sorted out and we're now in the process of
 deprecating htdp 1e's image library and eventually there won't be two
 choices to get confused.
 
 Also, FWIW, I'm glad you've got the right library now, as 2htdp/image
 generally draws a lot better than htdp/image does.
