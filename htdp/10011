 Why?  The documentation for the world teachpack gives its name using
 the usual require syntax.

 That's a mistake. We wanted to add a require syntax that is uniform  
 and doesn't trigger weird error messages. Just think of a student  
 typing in
 
   (require 'world)
 
 or
 
   (require 'world/"world")
 
 or such stuff.

 I really think that (require foo/bar) is the *simplest* syntax,
 whereas lib etc are more complex and harder to understand.

 That wasn't around when Matthew added require to the teaching languages.
 
 What Robby and I discovered while we ran the universe-Chicago  
 experiment is that things aren't quite right for require/provide in  
 the teaching languages period. It will require more thought.

 2htdp/universe is represented by a symbol in the syntax.

 Yes, but the additional structure of the identifier on top of the
 underlying symbol is ignored by `require'.

 No, it isn't. The lexical information of the identifier determines
 where the imports bind. But that's beside the point.
 
 Syntactically, it's an identifier. If you want to describe the
 syntactic construct in terms of its representation, I suggest calling
 it "an address in my process's virtual memory space".
