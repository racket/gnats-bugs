>Description:
A program that tracks mouse movements on a canvas with a small black disk, marks clicks with a larger red disk, and supports dragging and erasing (by a click) of the red disk exhibits three different behaviors on different systems: (1) Windows works as expected, (2) Linux black ball stops tracking when you click to place the red ball and doesn't start retracking until the mouse leaves the canvas and returns, but placing and erasing the red ball works as expected (3) Mac does not erase the red ball when you click on it but tracking and dragging work as expected.

 Rex,
 
 This appears, at least for the Mac, to be a difference in how the
 window system reports events.  Mac OS X reports a drag event (often
 zero-distance) after every click, which defeats the toggle-on-click
 behavior by triggering the drag handler.  I was not able to duplicate
 the described behavior on Linux; that probably depends on a specific
 window manager.
 
 You can work around this by programming to a looser specification of
 the mouse events; either change your program's behavior, or keep track
 of when you've "just clicked" and ignore subsequent drag events at the
 same location.
 
 Unfortunately, I don't believe we can guarantee identical GUI behavior
 on all platforms, but I'll refer this bug to the maintainers of the
 underlying code and see what we can come up with.
 
 Thanks for the report, and sorry I can't be more helpful at the moment.

 Rex,
 
 I'll see what I can do for the Mac situation.  Spurious drag events
 shouldn't be too hard to weed out.  For the Linux system, can you or
 Sean send me details on his setup?  What platform, Linux distribution,
 window system, and window manager is he using?

 I've reproduced this bug in the Intermediate Student language, so it
 is not a Dracula-specific problem.  Here's the same code in the
 DrScheme teaching languages.  I will reassign this bug to Matthias.
 Sorry for the delay.

 Matthew,
 
 after you run the program fragment below, move your mouse over the  
 frame,
 rest it, click, let go. Now let go of the mouse and to switch back to  
 drscheme or
 the console where you run the program (this also works in plain mred,  
 too)
 you will see output like this:
 
 ...
 mouse event: move @ (???,YYY)
 mouse event: move @ (XXX,YYY)
 mouse event: button-down @ (XXX,YYY)
 mouse event: drag @ (XXX,YYY)
 mouse event: button-up @ (XXX,YYY)
 mouse event: leave @ (XXX,YYY)
 
 The actual numbers are irrelevant except that XXX stands for one and  
 the same
 number and YYY stands for another (but same) number throughout. Here  
 is the
 PROBLEM:
 
    mred on mac os x signals a DRAG event between
    the button-down and button-up event EVEN THOUGH
    THHE POSITION OF THE MOUSE DIDN'T CHANGE AT ALL.
 
 I haven't tried this on windows but I can explain the discrepancy in  
 behavior
 only in that mred on windows does not signal a drag event.
