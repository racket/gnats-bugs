>Description:
Running HtDP/2e rocket v2 demo, under BSL. I noticed that the empty-scene only draws its top and left border lines once a place-image (of the rocket jpg in this case)is done. That is, the empty-scene draws its four borders as long as it's empty, but once an image is placed inside, only the top and left side lines appear. This isn' a serious problem, but it is distracting to the students.

 This has been fixed for the next release by redefining empty-scene so
 that it draws inside the rectangle instead of using the standard
 'rectangle' primitive. For more on the difference, search for "nitty"
 on this page:

 I was hoping to get someone to try this out under Windows. But Isee
 there is no actual example program in the original PR, so I'll just
 close it.
 
 Marc, if you do want to try this out, the nightly builds are here:
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 Please feel free to re-open if it isn't looking right.

 Thanks, Robby, and sorry for not including a test program when I submitted
 my original bug report. I just tested the latest nightly build on my Ubuntu
 Linux box, and saw all four lines around the empty scene's frame, both
 statically, and animated. Terrific!  :-)  Here is my code, in case someone
 wants to test this out under Windows:
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 (require 2htdp/image)
 
 (define c (circle 20 "solid" "red"))
 (define mt (empty-scene 100 100))
 
 (place-image c 50 50 mt)
 
 (define (render-ball h)
   (place-image c 50 h mt))
 
 (animate render-ball)
 
 Thanks again. No need to reopen!  :-)
 
 Marc
