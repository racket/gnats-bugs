 I suspect that #hash just slipped thru the reader restrictions.=20
 
 But I couldn't find documentation for the functions added either.=20
 And that's what I am mostly concerned about not #hash per se.=20
 
 I should have worded the bug report better.=20

 The hash functions are only in ASL by my testing.
 
 All the hash functions are documented:

 htdp-advanced..ss._lang)._.Hash_.Tables)
