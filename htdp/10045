>Description:
Dear Matthias,

Sorry to disturb you with my metaphysical problems, but I saw that in 4.1.4 you did not take into account my (sad) observation that this standard Scheme code was broken in "Advanced" :

(define (fac n)
  (apply * (build-list n add1)))

because of the behavior of *. Did you forget it or are you opposed to using one-liners hof in "Advanced" ? As I am writing a book, I would like to know so to be able to take some design decisions...

Thanks,

   -jpr
