>Description:
A student noticed that when any test contains multiple instances of the same image, only the first instance is shown in the test failure report.

There also happens to be a font change after the image in the "actual value" box, when this occurs.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; Tested in BSL and ISL:
(define RECT (rectangle 10 20 "solid" "red"))
(define (foo x)
  (list RECT x RECT))
(check-expect (foo 5) (list RECT 6 RECT))
;; The second rect doesn't appear, and
;; neither rect appears in the expected value.
