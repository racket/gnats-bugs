>Description:
changing libraries that are used in teachpacks 
has no effect on the teachpacks
>How-To-Repeat:
Modify error-sig.ss in collects/htdp to include "hello"
as an identifier in the signature 

Modify error.ss to include (define hello 10) in the 
errorU unit. 

Add hello at some random place in teachpack/elevator.ss

Try to add the teachpack to DrScheme. It will signal an error
that says "hello" unbound ... even though it is in the signature.
