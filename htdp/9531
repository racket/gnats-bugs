>Description:
We made require available to the HtDP languages, but in Advanced, 
a (require "file.ss") form claims that it can't find the file. 

Reported by Jean-Paul Roy, reproduced for 4.0.1 pre-release bundle
>How-To-Repeat:
Create the following two files in the same directory: 

;; fac.ss: 
(module fac mzscheme
  (provide fac)
  (define (fac n) (+ x 1))
  (printf "Module fac loaded !\n"))

;; file "use-fac.scm", Advanced Student 
(require "fac.ss")
(fac 5)

;; --- 
;; open use-fac.scm and click RUN 
;; get this response: 
Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.0.1 [3m].
Language: Advanced Student.
open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/Users/matthias/Desktop/fac.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
