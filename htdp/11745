The documentation gives `filter' the contract

filter : ((X -> boolean) (listof X) -> (listof X))

but the following call does not raise an error

(filter (lambda (x) x) (list 1 2 3))

Is that behavior intentional?

(memf (lambda (x) x) (list 1 2 3)) is not an error either, but (ormap (lambda (x) x) (list 1 2 3)) is (though the error message mentions `or' not `ormap').

 I assume that this is about *SL only not about Racket in general. 
 
 I am not sure yet whether I want to fix this. I really like the idea of retaining such attributes from 'scripting' language attributes in HtDP. The question is whether this is good or whether I should just point to full Racket for this.

 I think we should be consistent -- either `if' should allow
 generalized booleans, or `filter' should reject them.  Personally, I'd
 be happy with allowing them everywhere, but perhaps BSL shouldn't.

 That's the key question: do you want such inconsistencies across *SL layers? 
 
 The other one is that boolean-ness introduces serious performance problems here.

 It's not an inconsistency, but just a restriction for BSL, right?  That is, all BSL programs that use the assumption that `if' only works with booleans will still function without change in ISL and ASL, right?

 I also think there should be some general rule that gets followed in
 how booleannes is treated. The current state (ormap signalling an
 error from or) doesn't seem good.

 In the past we had the guideline that positive behavior doesn't change as you go up, but negative behavior (errors) may disappear. I conjecture the rule has been broken before but I really like it.

 But here that's exactly what we have, right?  Errors that might occur in BSL (due to use of non-booleans in the test position of an if) would disappear as you go up.  I don't see any positive behavior changing, just negative, but I could be mistaken.

 That's the other kind of consistency and I am beginning to think that it is the more important kind for teaching.

 For the record, I have changed several functions not just filter: 
 
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.1.1.5--2011-05-24(c7d2f13/g) [3m].
 Language: Intermediate Student with lambda; memory limit: 256 MB.

 filter: the results of add1 (the function given to filter) must be of type <boolean>, produced 2
 > (quicksort '(2 0 1) list)
 quicksort: the results of list (the function given to quicksort) must be of type <boolean>, produced (list 0 2)

 > (ormap (lambda (x) (add1 x)) '(1 2 3))
 ormap: the results of the function given to ormap must be of type <boolean>, produced 2
 
 
 
 For memf, I changed the documentation. So one element of dynamically typed behavior is in.
