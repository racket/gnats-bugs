>Description:
By default, the HtDP Beginner language uses CONS notation for lists, i.e. (cons 3 empty). Unfortunately, the error display handler does not respect this. For example:

>  (+ 1 (cons 1 empty))
+: expects type <number> as 2nd argument, given: (list 1); other arguments were: 1

I think it would make more sense to see this:

>  (+ 1 (cons 1 empty))
+: expects type <number> as 2nd argument, given: (cons 1 empty); other arguments were: 1

Otherwise, we have to explain LIST notation to our students earlier than we'd like.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation (or a type error)

Responsible changed from "matthias" to "mflatt" by matthias at Wed, 26 Sep 2007 09:56:01 -0400
Reason>>> matthew initially added this behavior, and he had a good reason for it, but i 
can't remember it. 

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by matthias at Wed, 26 Sep 2007 09:56:01 -0400

Reason>>> I don't think I did this on purpose. (Maybe
Matthias was thinking about my addition of
`list' to Beginner?)

Any ideas, Robby?

 This is a bug in the teaching languages and I've fixed it (in SVN).
 
 This is separate, afaict, from the issue of whether or not list is in
 the language (which we were discussion elsewhere, at least I think we
 were ...)
