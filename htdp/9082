 I can't recall whether we had a reason to exclude list? from the  
 lower levels of the teaching languages. Looking at lang, it seems  
 clear that it's there and provided?
 
 BUT when I checked in advanced of the 371 collection, I saw this:
 
    (define-teach beginner list?
      (lambda (x)
        (or (null? x) (pair? x))))
 		
    ;; Don't need this anymore, since we just check for pairs:
    #;
    (define cyclic-list?
      (lambda (l)
        (or (list? l)
 	  (and (pair? l)
 	    (let loop ([hare (cdr l)][turtle l])
 	      (cond
 		[(eq? hare turtle) #t]
 		[(not (pair? hare)) #f]
 		[(eq? (cdr hare) turtle) #t]
 		[(not (pair? (cdr hare))) #f]
 		[else (loop (cddr hare) (cdr turtle))]))))))
 
    (define cyclic-list? beginner-list?)
 
 I don't understand why cyclic-list is commented out. Is a cyclic list  
 a list for advanced programmers?

 1. I am checking into this problem.
 
 2. Your desire to use list? (and your explanation) suggests a subtle  
 misunderstanding. It is extremely rare that a design according to the  
 design principles of HtDP should use the list? function.
 
 3. Its definition is (or (null? x) (cons? x)), which may help you for  
 a while.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by matthias at Wed, 07 May 2008 10:02:45 -0400
Reason>>> we analyzed it but i don't see a conclusion. it's pedagogically wrong to provide it 
until S-expressions are used. 


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by matthias at Sat, 01 Aug 2009 12:32:16 -0400
Reason>>> list? was added
