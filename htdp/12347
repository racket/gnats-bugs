 I think that you'll need to upgrade, I'm sorry to say.

 Have you considered "(require picturing-programs)"?  It includes both images and universe, as well as a few other things, and they all seem to play nicely together.
 
 Oh, wait: you're using 4.2.3, in which picturing-programs wasn't bundled.  If you have to stay at 4.2.3 for some reason, you can install it as follows:
 
 1) Switch languages to "Use the language declared in the source", and click "Run".
 2) In the Interactions pane, type
 	(require (planet sbloch/picturing-programs:2))
 It may take a few minutes to install this, after which you'll see the message
 	"Wrote file 'picturing-programs.ss' to installed-teachpacks directory."
 3) Switch languages back to BSL or whatever and click "Run".
 
 The next time you start DrRacket, you have two ways to load the library:
 (a) on the Teachpacks menu, choose "Add Teachpack...", and you should see it in the list of "User-Installed Teachpacks"; or
 (b) type "(require installed-teachpacks/picturing-programs)" in the Definitions pane.
 I prefer the latter.

 Are you sure picturing programs doesn't inherit the same problems that
 universe and image have in 4.2.3?

 I taught a semester's class using picturing-programs in either 4.2.1 or 4.2.3, and I don't recall running into any particular collisions.  (IIRC, the labs on campus had 4.2.1, and most of the students downloaded 4.2.3.)

 Alex: maybe something is going on here that we do not understand.
 Perhaps you can supply a small example program that breaks so we can
 see  more clearly the issue?
 
 Thanks,

Since we are not having any problems using rotate with big-bang, 
there appears to be no need to keep this one open. 

(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(big-bang 0
          (on-tick (lambda (x) (+ .3 x)))
          (to-draw (lambda (x) 
                     (overlay (rotate x (square 30 "solid" "red"))
                              (square 100 "solid" "white")))))
