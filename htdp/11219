 Hi: thanks for the bug report.
 
 Can you be a bit more specific? Namely, it would be helpful to have a
 (small!) program that behaves in a way you do not expect, plus an
 explanation of what you do expect.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 rotate-cw and rotate-ccw are built on 2htdp/image/rotate, which did indeed h=
 ave this behavior in 5.0.1, but in my experience it works correctly in 5.0.1=
 .5.
 
 Adam, could you check your version numbers?  Does the problem still happens i=
 n 5.0.1.5?
