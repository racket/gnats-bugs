>Description:
big-bang has a record option. If you click Run while recording is in option (saving individual images, then generating the GIF), the recording halts. But recording can take a while; it's a good idea to let it continue to Run. Instead, the World pop-up window should have its own "Stop Recording" button.

 Hi Kathy -- what is the problem? I see the solution you're proposing,
 but I'm not quite getting what the problem is.
 
 As a strawman question, why did you click Run again instead of just waiting=
 ?
