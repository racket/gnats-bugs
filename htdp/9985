>Description:
I was playing with some code using Advanced
Student and discovered that unquoted beneath
a quasiquoted vector were treated as if they
were beneath a quoted vector literal.

I skimmed through HtDP and the online 
documentation, but could not find any 
description of the syntax/semantics
for quasi-quoting or even *quoting*
vectors in Advanced Student.

If the intention is that quotation of
vector literals be illegal, then attempting
to quote/quasiquote a vector literal should
produce an error.  If the intention is
that such quotation be legal, then it should
be documented.

(And also, if vector literals are legal
in Advanced Student, I would prefer
if the semantics of unquote underneath a
quasiquoted vector literal were "corrected.")

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.3 [3m].
Language: Advanced Student custom; memory limit: 512 megabytes.
Teachpack: world.ss.
