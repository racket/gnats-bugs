>Description:
This fifth item is actually a feature request. It would be useful when writing
automated graders to have access to the location information for exceptions thrown by
beginner programs ran in the sandbox. As of now, the locations are stored with the exception under
a private continuation mark key, which is defined at htdp-langs.ss:943. Similarily, it would be
useful to have some way to access to the result of the test coverage.

 I think that Matthias's "Huh" probably translates into English as "I don't
 see how eliminate the sandbox code from the program; can you help with that
 first, please?".

 Yeah, I got that -- the missing context is in the Guillaume's text
 (http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=10445) -- he's asking
 for a way to extract source information from exceptions, and he says
 that this information is stored in the continuation marks under a
 private key in the HtDP language implementation.  Exposing that is a
 feature request for the HtDP language, so I moved the category of the
 bug...
 
 He's also asking about coverage information -- and I'm assuming that
 he's referring to coverage after running the *SL tests, and that's the
 usual problem with running those tests anywhere outside of DrRacket.
 (If he wants the coverage information regardless of tests, then that's
 already available in the sandbox interface.)

Responsible changed from "matthias" to "eli" by matthias at Wed, 04 Jul 2012 11:51:14 -0400
Reason>>> see below 

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by matthias at Wed, 04 Jul 2012 11:51:14 -0400
Reason>>> Reassigned to Eli: please create a program in *SL that doesn't deliver the 
information to the sandbox that it should.
