>Description:
In the docs for 2htdp/image, section 2.3.10 "Pinholes" says "When images are overlay’d, underlay’d (or the variants of those functions), placed beside, or above each other, the pinhole of the resulting image is the pinhole of the first image argument passed to the combining operation."

This is true of overlay.  But with underlay, the pinhole of the *last* image argument is used.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require 2htdp/image)
(define canvas (put-pinhole 50 50 (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "gray")))
(define blue-line (line 150 150 "blue"))
(define red-line (line 150 -150 "red"))
(underlay canvas blue-line red-line)
(underlay blue-line red-line canvas)
