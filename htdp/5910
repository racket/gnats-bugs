>Description:
Load the sample solution for problem 9.5.5.  Set the Teachpack
to guess.ss in Beginner mode.  Click Execute.
If you try guess-with-gui-list on a small value it works fine.
But it produces bad errors on large values, AND it does not
run more than once!  The former needs to be protected against
given the instincts of kids, and the latter is a bad
implelementaiton attribute.

 You can play the game as many times as you want. Why do you want to 
 start it more than once? (It's doable but I decided it was a bad idea.)
