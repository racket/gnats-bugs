>Description:
when I save an image using the save-image function the outputted image has a 1 px line appended to its right and bottom

the image I'm saving has dimensions 867x635, the saved image would be 868x636 with the white lines added
>How-To-Repeat:
running this code reproduces the problem

#lang racket

(require 2htdp/image)

(define img (rectangle 867 635 'solid 'black))
(save-image img "/tmp/img.png")
(bitmap "/tmp/img.png")

 Yes, this is intentional. It has to do with the way lines draw (there
 are some small notes about this in the documentation at the end). Let
 me know if you have a better solution.
