A student typed
(triangle 50 30 "solid")
and got a light gray triangle rather than an error message.  I've replicated it, both on Mac and on Windows.

 Aha!  On re-reading the new docs, I see that the second argument to  
 "triangle" IS allowed to be a number, and it's used as an alpha for  
 the whole image.  The student typed "solid" as the color, it wasn't  
 found in the color table, so it defaulted to black, but at only a  
 30/255 alpha level, so on a white background it looked light gray.   
 That explains everything; close the bug.
