>Description:
In the teaching languages, the test failure window does not update somehow when the source locations get out of date. For example, say you have two test cases:

(check-expect 1 10)
(check-expect 1 10)

Run the program, and then edit the first "1" to make it a "10". Click on the second test case error message and it will select the wrong region of text.

This could be fixed by simply not allowing clicks to highlight ranges when the editor has been edited.

A better solution would be to track edits (using after-insert and after-delete) and update the source locations in a corresponding manner. Of course, if one edits in the offending test case, then clicking on that one shouldn't work anymore, but the others still could.
