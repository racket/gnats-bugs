 The report is from a fresh git build.  I just confirmed it in 5.0.2 as well.
 
 This is a major issue for my class notes in the upcoming semester.

 Can you use define-struct from non-advanced as a work-around?

 Oh, sorry.
 
 But iiuc, this is only a problem in your scribblings, right? Not in
 the REPL? So you could just use racket's define-struct there? (as a
 work around)

 It breaks in BSL, ISL+, and ASL.  Do you mean non-student?
 
 We are considering providing our own define-struct in order to work 
 around the issue.

 I think the real solution is to make the examples' evaluator use the ISL 
 printer.

 This will break other important things.  For example, images will no 
 longer render as images in Scribble.
 
 Here is a tweak to the code to demonstrate the issue.
 
 You either get nice ISL style printing (of non-image values) or you get 
 image rendering.
