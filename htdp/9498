>Description:
when looking up check-error from Intermediate +, you get a cross 
reference to Beginning Student. 

As it turns out, we have users who wish to jump directly to 
Intermediate + . They believe in this ... what can I say. 
It would be nice if we just replicated the docs for all 
language levels, perhaps with the phrase (unchanged from 
Beginning Student language) added. 

Thanks.

 That's a dangerous path, with the docs doubling both build time and
 installer sizes...
