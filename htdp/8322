>Description:
The world.ss documentation does not give any suggestion that any of the image.ss functions it provides should behave differently from their image.ss counterparts. So, I expect this program:

(define a (overlay (add-line (rectangle 50 50 'solid 'blue) -25 -25 25 25 'red)
                   (circle 5 'solid 'black)))

to bind `a' to a 50-by-50 blue box with a black circle in the middle and a red slash through them, and I expect (pinhole-x a) -> 25, (pinhole-y a) -> 25. If I use the image.ss teachpack, that's what happens.  If I use world.ss instead, I get a drawing that only looks vaguely like what I expect: I get an image with what appears to be a 25-by-25 blue-shaded region that has a red slash through it and a dot in the top-left corner. Furthermore (pinhole-x a) -> 5 and (pinhole-y a) -> 5. add-line seems to be the critical ingredient that's messing things up; images I build up that don't include it seem to behave as I expect.

 I see image.ss renames add-line-to-scene to add-line. Why not just keep
 two separate names?

 So that the contracts don't have to be repeated and the correct error  
 message shows up.

 BTW, I consider this the only sensible behavior for add-line.
 
 I am considering adding an entirely different type: Scene. Then  
 redraw events would consume Scenes only and world would export  
 entirely different names. I don't have the time to do this right now,  
 but it's on my plate.

 Two different functions with the same name is probably not the best  
 state of affairs.

 I don't understand that. You mean in the docs? the whole point is  
 that you have to re-do the docs when you change the semantics anyways!

 Can you explain that a little more?

 In the meantime, I think you should rename the function so this  
 confusion doesn't happen again. Either that, or I can rename  
 image.ss's one. As you wish.

 Please read the code.
 
 I have reclassified the bug as a doc-bug and will change the docs for  
 the next release.
 
 If you change the name in image.ss, I will change the function in  
 world.ss to the same name :-)

 You're being willfully confusing then? I don't get it.

 PS: I did read the code. I don't get why you'd do that, but I don't
 know where you're using it, either.
 
 PPS: the right long term fix to go away from pinholes (as we both know,
 I think) and towards a superimposition model (probably with coordinate
 based operations that always work from the top-left).
