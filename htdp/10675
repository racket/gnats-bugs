>Description:
I was trying to remove a user-installed teachpack (why can't I do this?) and I tried to drag one of them into the preinstalled teachpacks pane, and got the error below. I was able to reproduce this by dragging fairly quickly, it didn't always happen. It doesn't happen in the other direction.

Uh... also, right now, if I click on this bug report form anywhere it beeps at me and disappears. Oh. Ha! It's because I had the add teachpack screen open. That's a bug too I guess!

 Thanks for the report. The first one sounds like a real bug, but the
 second one is, I believe, just how the OS deals with dialog boxes,
 iiuc.
