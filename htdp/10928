 Is this something I should fix for the next release or not?
 
 I'm thinking "no" because equal? works.

 If it is simple to fix, I'd say do it. If not, remove image=3D? from
 2htdp/image to avoid the problem?

 It's critical if we wish people to explore 2htdp/image and I think we  
 do.

 image=3D? comes from the teaching language itself, not from 2htdp/image.

 The release branch has already been created and, according to our
 release process, we only add things after that point if there is great
 need. The argument you put forth below does not read like great need
 to me (ie, two months from now will also be fine for the fix to
 appear, at the next release).
 
 Is there more to it than that?

 The "image=3D?" function should work on non-deprecated images unless it =
 is itself deprecated.
 
 The authors of HtDP went to great lengths to avoid "equal?", and I've =
 been following their lead for the most part (not mentioning it until the =
 Lists chapter, when one would like to be able to write a function that =
 searches a list of any type(s) of objects for a match to a specific =
 object).  If you folks want to encourage beginning students to use =
 "equal?" instead of type-specific versions of it, you might as well also =
 ditch string=3D?, symbol=3D?, key=3D?, etc. at the same time.  And =
 please let me know that's what you're doing :-)
 
 Of course, since "equal?" works, it should be really easy to get =
 "image=3D?" working: just check the argument types, then call "equal?".

 2htdp/image has been in the release for several releases now which
 would seem to weaken that argument. Or am I missing something?

 Well, as I understand it you're trying to move all your users from =
 htdp/image to 2htdp/image .  If you advertise the existence of an =
 image=3D? function (or even if you don't, since a student could =
 reasonably guess that a function by that name would exist), it should =
 work.  That seems like a no-brainer to me :-)
 
 To put it another way, I've just modified my picturing-programs =
 teachpack to omit all mention of htdp/image and pinholes, and am in the =
 process of modifying the textbook accordingly.  There are exercises in =
 the book for which students will want to use image=3D?.  As things stand =
 right now, they can't.  And I'm hoping to send the complete book to a =
 publisher in a matter of weeks.

 This looks like a new way (not another way!) and is definitely
 convincing. I'll try making the change.

 I agree with Stephen: DMdA also goes to great lengths to avoid equal?.
 In fact, in the DMdA teaching languages, equal? is only available in the
 levels #3 & #4, but we use in images in level #2.
