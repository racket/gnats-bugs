>Description:
It currently is difficult or impossible to test some functions such as on-tick handlers in universe.ss (which must return bundles) when they are required to return bundles:  for example, if an output bundle should contain randomized elements in one field, we can't deconstruct the bundle to apply a predicate to the field.

One solution that occurs to me is to provide a form
(check-bundle expr pred1 pred2 pred3)
that checks that expr is a bundle and its fields pass the three given preds.
