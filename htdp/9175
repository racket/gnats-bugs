>Description:
Sorry for the intrusion, but I just couldn't figure this one out on my own.

I am using R5RS to teach undergrads Scheme (I make use of things like the ability to redefine functions which advanced student does not allow)

I have a program where I would like to open a canvas, draw a bunch of things, then erase the canvas. Then redefine a few functions and redraw the canvas, and so on. Without having to restart the whole interpreter, which makes the interactive nature of this useless..

== However, if I use draw.ss this does not work with R5RS -- it complains that make-posn is not defined. If I use draw.ss with advanced student, it does what I want, but I really wanted to be in R5RS.

== If I use world.ss instead, then I can not see how to just get a canvas window to draw on. Place-image/empty-scene constantly redraws the scene in the buffer window. I tried using big-bang, however I cannot see how to restart a animation (big-bang understandably occurs once) without restarting the whole simulator. 

Is there some way to create a drawing canvas window in R5RS that I am missing?

Thanks so much for your help!

 Add the following teachpacks in v360:
 
   -- from collects/htdp : draw.ss
   -- from collects/lang : posn.ss
 
 Then this kind of thing runs just fine:
 
 (start 100 100)
 (draw-circle (make-posn 50 50) 10 'red)
 
 ;; ---
 
 This trick will NOT work in 370 and up.
 
 You also need to understand that I will deprecate draw.ss for the  
 next version of HtDP. The world.ss is far superior for teaching  
 undergraduates.

 The above sentence looks to me like a deep-seated prejudice that I  
 have repeatedly encountered in your former MIT group. If you could be  
 so kind and explain what this means with an example, I would very  
 much appreciate it. To give you some background: I was a firm  
 believer in the REPL, the Emacs, and doing everything with those two  
 things. Once I abandoned that alchemist belief, the programming of my  
 undergraduates got so much better I never wanted to go back there.  
 (And believe me, the kids at Rice are as smart as the kids at Harvard.)
 
 I might be at HU next Friday (visiting Greg, as in Mor*is*et*). If  
 not, Carl will be and either one of us will be there and we could do  
 this in person, which might be most helpful.
 
 In the meantime, enjoy the above. -- Matthias
