>Description:
In Intermediate Student with lambda and Advance Student, the lambda character (Ctrl + \) does not work. When it is used in the definitions window, the error is "λ: name is not defined, not an argument, and not a primitive name". When it is used in the REPL, the error is "reference to undefined identifier: λ".

 I don't use many of the things I maintain, either!
 
 The point is, it's in the menu. So, it needs to work or be gone.
 
 I can make it work, or I can make it gone. Let me know what you prefer.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 01 Aug 2006 12:39:58 -0400
Reason>>> I removed the lambda menu item from the htdp teaching languages.

 It's gone.
 
 BTW, would you consider this PR to be a contract violation or not?

 I guess so. One could have written a contract (if the menu function  
 runs, the editor contains a lambda-symbol).

 That contract holds, tho.
 
 I was thinking more that the violation is the "unbound identifier"
 error.

 Sorry, I never tried and didn't know what the actual bug was.

 I'd still like your opinion on whether or not you consider this a
 contract violation ... Here's the bug "I select insert-lambda from the
 menu, then make a well-formed lambda, then click execute, then get an
 `undefined lambda' error".
 
 Is that a contract violation or not?
