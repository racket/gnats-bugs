>Description:
Even if the program below is legitimately buggy, the error message ought to be a lot better.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define n 3)
(: n Number)
works fine.  But
(: 3 Number)
produces

<collects>/syntax/boundmap.rkt: 
  (file
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket\5.0.1\collects\lang\private\teach-module-begin.rkt)
 broke the contract 
  (case->
   (-> bound-identifier-mapping? identifier? any)
   (->
    bound-identifier-mapping?
    identifier?
    (-> any)
    any))
 on bound-identifier-mapping-get; expected <identifier?>, given: #<syntax:3:3 3>

[I understand that it seems to be trying to look up an identifier, and is finding a non-identifier, 3.  Clearly, a better error message is possible.  But I don't understand why it *must* be an identifier.  We want students to be able to build their intuition for signatures starting from simple examples, and it seems un-functional to not allow the above.]
