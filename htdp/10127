>Description:
The world teachpack doesn't give access to the control/command/alt/option keys on key events.

Some key presses are automatically converted because they have a "normal" character, such as #\a vs #\A. However, if you're on the Mac and press Alt-a, you'll get #\Ã¥ but I imagine something different on Windows.

Also, in all the cases that world turns key presses into symbols, such as with the space bar. The key event is the same regardless of what modifier keys are also used.

 The specific use I was thinking of was to have the left and right
 arrows be skipping "frames" of an animation, while pressing shift at
 the same time would skip larger chunks.
 
 My biggest annoyance with this is that shift/alt work fine on normal
 characters, except in the odd way mentioned for alt-letter.
 
 I'll survive whatever you decided.

 I've looked at the code and one way to deal with this is to have a
 parameter like key-event-shift-down? that is set by reading
 get-shift-down off the key event inside on-char. This way the
 interface doesn't change, but additional information can be available
 when needed.

 That doesn't sound like something we'd want to expose to students, is it?

 Sorry to be daft. But which part of what I said did you mean?
 
 I think we should expose shift/alt/etc, but not without going through
 an additional function. (That is, I don't think on-key should be given
 'shift-left and 'left.) Instead, I think there should be a parameter
 (as in make-parameter) so the on-key function could be written:
 
 (if (key-event-shift-down?)
   ...
   ...)
 
 That way most students could ignore it, but we aren't in the position
 of telling the student they can't do something that is actually quite
 easy.
 
 Like I said before, I'm not obsessed about this and I'm just trying to
 be constructive. I sent another email because I noticed in the code a
 way to do it in a compatible way.

 But that use of key-event-shift-down? is completely imperative, and
 violates the functional design of the teachpack.  That's why you
 wouldn't want to give it to a student -- you'd have to explain to them
 how a function that takes no arguments could produce a different value
 each time the event handler was called.

 You are very right. The only other thing I can think of is making a
 Key-Event contain the information and having (key=3D? k 'left) be true
 when the modifier is down or not. But that seems like a bad interface
 for the students. So, nevermind.
