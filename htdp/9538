 I can reconstruct this bug in the released version BUT not in the  
 SVN'ed version. The culprit is the 'scheme' lang in collects/ 
 world.ss, which I changed back to 'mzscheme' within hours of  
 experimenting with it on June 17. (Matthew confirmed my suspicion  
 within minutes.)
 
 Stephepn: To fix on your installation, go to world.ss, change #lang  
 scheme to #lang mzscheme, run setup-plt -l htdp, and enjoy.

 I suspect that the message to Eli about a new (actually old) world.ss  
 version on June 17 didn't make it. I had requested a new build at  
 that point. (Then again, some near-nuclear email spoiled that  
 evening ... )
 
 I'll close off the report.
