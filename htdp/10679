>Description:
I'd like to request that with-input-from-file and with-output-to-file be included in the Advanced Student language.  They don't require any concepts that aren't already used in ASL, and they would allow additional real-world applications.

It would be nice to also have a with-input-from-url function, again to allow real-world applications.  I envision this taking in a url in string form and a thunk, i.e. basically the same API as with-input-from-file.

 Thanks, Matthias.  It occurred to me after sending that I should have =
 also mentioned with-input-from-string, which
 makes it reasonable to test input-based functions.
 
 with-input-from-url is somewhat more complicated, I guess, but it would =
 be cool to have.

 Lovely; that makes testing much easier.  This will be in 4.2.4?
 
 I don't know if there would be any point in having a "with-io-strings" =
 that combines the two, for testing convenience:
 
 ; with-io-strings : string thunk -> string
 (define (with-io input thunk)
    (with-output-to-string
       (lambda () (with-input-from-string input thunk))))
