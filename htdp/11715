 I believe this is intentional. Did you read the nitty gritty section?
 Can you explain what you want in those terms?

 Stephen and I had a discussion about this PR that I only noticed now
 wasn't cc'd to the PR's transcript. The ulimate conclusion seems to be
 that the only complaint Stephen has is about how crop treats its
 numericarguments. Specifically, this program
 
   #lang racket
   (require 2htdp/image)
   (crop 0 0 101 61 (rectangle 100 60 'outline 'black))
 
 crops off the right and bottom lines from the rectangle, even though
 they do draw inside the given rectangle.
 
 This is because the crop operator automatically shrinks the given
 rectangle to be inside the bounding box of the image. Thus, for any
 image that draws outside its bounding box, crop as currently
 implemented is guaranteed to remove pixels from the image, even if you
 supply numeric arguments that include where that image draws.
 
 In the above example, this means that the call to crop as given is the
 same as this one:
 
   (crop 0 0 100 60 (rectangle 100 60 'outline 'black))
 
 Indeed:
 
 > (equal? (crop 0 0 101 61 (rectangle 100 60 'outline 'black))
           (crop 0 0 100 60 (rectangle 100 60 'outline 'black)))

 As I'm looking into this, I also realize that cropping and the
 image-baseline function interact in a non-obvious way. So you may want
 to look at that (I'll push a commit shortly).

 And for the transcript, this is a more widespread problem than it seems at first because "crop" happens implicitly in lots of other places, e.g. "freeze".
