>Description:
Trying to render a 1-pixel rectangle on the screen using 2htdp/image fails in certain
cases. Rendering of other odd pixel images are also inconsistent.

Our hypothesis is that this is due to the image being aligned at a
half-pixel, which causes the image to be truncated at a pixel
boundary. In the case of the 1-pixel rect, it just gets truncated
to nothing.

This is a problem because 2htdp has exercises (e.g. exercise 63) that use 1-pixel
images, which have been disappearing in the output of functions students write for
homework.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is a minimal example which fails on my computer:

(place-image (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red") 50 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))

and this succeeds (renders as expected):

(place-image (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red") 50.3 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))

this succeeds (displays a red line between two pieces of text):

(require 2htdp/image)

(beside
   (text "foo" 11 "black")
   (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red")
   (text "bar" 11 "black")))

while this fails (just text):

(beside
   (text "foo" 10 "black")
   (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red")
   (text "bar" 10 "black")))

These two (note the three pixel rectangle) are rendered differently:

(place-image (rectangle 3 20 "solid" "red") 50 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))
(place-image (rectangle 3 20 "solid" "red") 50.3 50
             (empty-scene 300 100))

 Hi all,
 
 Sorry for the duplicate bug report, DrRacket's reporter was hanging
 on me.
 
 I ran the examples in my bug report on a newer version of DrRacket
 which solved some of the issues, but not all.
 
 Specifically, the first example with the rectangle on the
 empty scene still fails to show.
 
 The second example with the text works fine.
 
 The last example still shows rectangles of differing widths.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Robby/Ian, I think one fix here is to take these exercises out of =
 HtDP/2e. What do you think?=20

 I think my recent push fixes all of them.

 Just a quick glance at 63 suggests the image library should cope with it fine.
 
 But you don't want to use place-image to put the cursor (as mentioned
 earlier). It may be worth pointing that out in the exercise.

 Thanks Robby, that fixed all of the original examples I had.
