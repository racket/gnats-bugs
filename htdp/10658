>Description:
Using the World via the Universe teachpack with big-bang.

The "leave" and "enter" MouseEvents do not occur for a small window placed far from the upper left corner of the screen.

Further analysis (perhaps imperfect and too assuming on my part) seems to reveal two contributing reasons for this behavior:

1.  It appears that the mouse coordinates reported during "leave" and "enter" events are in screen coordinates, measured from the upper left corner of my screen; while mouse coordinates reported during "move" events are in World coordinates, measured from the origin of the World scene.

2.  It appears that mouse events are not passed to the mouse handler if the coordinates to be reported would fall outside the boundary of the World.

Combining behaviors 1 and 2 result in some "leave" events going unreported because screen coordinates may be much larger than World coordinates.  In fact, because WinXP seems to be restricting how high I place my windows, I cannot create a World which reports "leave" events through the bottom edge of the World.  Though overlapping windows produces some recognition of a downward "leave" event.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using the code included below, keep an eye on the state window...

Setup:
 a- Included below is a 400x400 window.
 b- Place it about 300 pixels diagonally from the screen(s)'s upper left corner.
 c- "leave" events ARE reported when leaving through the upper left corner of the World window.
 d- "leave" events ARE NOT reported when leaving through the lower right corner of the World window.
 e- There is an X-coordinate along the top edge of the World such that, to the left, "leave" events will fire, but to the right, "leave" events will not fire.
 f- The mouse coordinates of a "leave" event are sometimes a drastic jump from the preceding "move" event.
 g- If you place the World window such that it is more than 400 pixels from either the left or top edge of the screen then no "leave" event are reported whatsoever.

I realize that some of the above behavior may not be considered buggy.

; A World is either
;  - "initial state"
;  - (make-world Num Num MouseEvent), storing the latest mouse event parameters
(define-struct world (x y me))

; I start the size of the canvas small enough
; so that the window can be placed in a variety of positions
(define WIDTH 400)
(define HEIGHT 400)

; mouse-handler: World Num Num MouseEvent -> World
; purpose: update the World with the latest MouseEvent data
(define (mouse-handler ws x y me)
  (make-world x y me))

; render: World -> Scene
; purpose: draw an empty scene for the purpose of receiving mouse events
(define (render ws)
  (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))

(big-bang "initial state" (on-mouse mouse-handler) (on-draw render) (state true))
