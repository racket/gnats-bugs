>Description:
If you provide an optional stop-when render
function and set record? to true, the 
animation generator always uses the stop-when
rendering function rather than the on-draw
rendering function.

This bug shows up in 5.0.1; using a more
recent build from git, this bug is hidden by
bug 11348.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program in BSL (5.0.1).  Let it count
to five, then save the images.  All of the
images say "Done".

(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

(define (draw-number n)
  (place-image (text (number->string n) 44 'red)
               50 50
               (empty-scene 100 100)))

(define (big? n) (> n 5))

(define (draw-done n)
  (place-image (text "Done" 20 'purple)
               50 50
               (empty-scene 100 100)))

(big-bang 0
          (on-tick add1 1)
          (on-draw draw-number)
          (stop-when big? draw-done)
          (record? true))

Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by matthias at Wed, 27 Oct 2010 10:10:54 -0400
Reason>>> it is partially fixed. the record?-based images and the animated gif now uses 
the proper drawing function. BUT, the last picture in the recording does NOT 
use the stop-when drawing function. 

I am thinking of recording the images instead of the world when record? is 
set. In that case, this problem will just disappear. 

Until then, I am leaving this report suspended.
