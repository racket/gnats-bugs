>Description:
Using the testing.ss teachpack and the generate-report function
results in reports that do not use, e.g., (cons ... (cons ...))
in the beginner language (instead they use (list), unknown until
beginner-wla).
>How-To-Repeat:
Open new file.
Set lang-level to Beginning Student
evaluate:
(check-expect (cons 3 empty) (cons 4 empty))
(generate-report)

See use of "list" in report
