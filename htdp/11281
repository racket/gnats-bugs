>Description:
I spent a while trying to track down a bug, and then realized I had typed

  (f True)

instead of

  (f true)

It took me a second, and a double-take, to catch the problem.  My students will not be so lucky.

This concretizes my dislike of the signatures sitting in the value namespace.

Responsible changed from "matthias" to "mflatt" by matthias at Wed, 13 Oct 2010 10:12:30 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew added #true and #false to the language. Now we need to take out 
'true' and 'false' from the teaching languages, and we need to teach drracket 
to print #true and #false in these cases.
