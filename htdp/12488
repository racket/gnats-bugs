>Description:
The bitmap command in 2htdp/image doesn't work if the string it is supplied with is made with string-append.

For example, 
(bitmap "pictures\\ocean.png") 
will return and image, However, 
(bitmap (string-append "pictures\\" "ocean" ".png")) does not, even though (string-append "pictures\\" "ocean" ".png") returns "pictures\\ocean.png".

I'm not sure if this is really a bug or not, but I was told by someone in the IRC to report it.

 This isn't a bug. bitmap's argument is not a string that gets
 evaluated, it is a static description of a path to a file.

 I mentioned to Ryan on IRC that I thought it was a bug. Can `bitmap' evaluate its argument if its not an identifier?

 No, bitmap needs to know its argument at compile time, so it can
 cooperate with executable creation (it doesn't at the moment, and
 that's a bug).

 You can close it in that case, or I can close if for you.
 
 However, this seems like it's something that comes up repeatedly, and
 I'm not sure the executable creation is worth the expressiveness
 limitation.  Right now, it's a big pain to load "0.jpg" through
 "9.jpg" into your file.
