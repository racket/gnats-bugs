>Description:
I'm having a problem with the solution to exercise 10.3.6
When I run it and use the control-left-right function,
the face is not cleared with each click.
I've looked at the example in the teachpack for arrow
and it works properly there, but I don't see what the problem is with the textbook solution.

 Looks like a bug in the teachpack, from what I can tell.

 The bug is in the BOOK. The text reads:

 It ought to say

 If you do this, which is what my solution looks like, you get the 
 desired effect:
 
 ;; move : number list-of-shapes -> list-of-shapes
 ;; moves each shape on the screen, delta pixels
 (define (move-picture delta a-los)
    (cond
      [(and
        (clear-losh a-los)
        (sleep-for-a-while 1)
        (draw-losh (translate-losh a-los delta)))
       (translate-losh a-los delta)]
      [else a-los]))
 
 -- Matthias (still a bit puzzled, but the good news, this exercise is 
 going away in HtDP/2e)

 [ Shriram: I've put new solutions into the staging area. ]
 
 I tried (as below) but found that clear, draw, and then sleep works
 better for the automatic animations. I'm still seeing a problem for the
 arrows teachpack, tho. I can go right a few times, but then when I go
 back left it won't go back all the way to the left. Strange.
 
 I can try to look into the arrow teachpack later on, if necc.

 Thanks for looking at this.  I found that having move do clear, then sleep and then draw worked better for me.  When I did draw before clear, interesting things happened with the face.  I ended up with a couple showing at once.
