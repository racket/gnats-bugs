the draw.ss teachpack documentation includes a worked example at the end, but that uses operators that are not listed as part of the teachpack (specifically, the clear operations from the original draw.ss).  This caused a lot of confusion for some of our teachers.

 Kathi, the docs contain the following sentence:

 Is that sentence not clear enough? (This has been the state of the docs 
 for several years and this is the first time I hear about this 
 complaint.)

 Somehow, the teachers who asked and I all missed that sentence.  Part
 of the confusion was from the mix of image.ss, world.ss, and draw.ss
 (each of which teachers used at some point during the workshop). 
 Anyway, cancel the bug.
