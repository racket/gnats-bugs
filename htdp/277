 These are all the changes I can find:
 
 - restriction on applications is that the procedure position must be a
   top-level name (ie, primitive, user-defined or as-yet-unbound)
   [<= 'structured]
 
 - empty argument lists are disallowed
   [<= 'structured]
 
 - if is required to have an else clause
   [<= 'structured]
 
 - quote only works on symbols
   [< 'side-effecting]
 
 - case only exists at advanced levels (to be consistent w/ quote)
   [>= 'side-effecting]
