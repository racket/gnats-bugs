>Description:
The x and y positions passed to the handler installed by on-mouse-event are offset by a few pixels (down and to the right).  The code below (under Steps to Reproduce) draws a red circle anywhere the user clicks; the circle's center should be on the mouse's point but instead it shows up buried under the mouse pointer icon.

(This behavior was observed in the Beginning Student language, with the world.ss teachpack installed, on Mac OS X, running from the latest SVN sources.)
>How-To-Repeat:
;; World = Posn

(define (mousey world x y kind)
  (cond
    [(or (symbol=? 'button-down kind)
         (symbol=? 'drag kind))
     (make-posn x y)]
    [else world]))

(define (image w)
  (place-image (circle 10 'solid 'red) (posn-x w) (posn-y w)
               (empty-scene 300 300)))

(big-bang 300 300 .1 (make-posn 0 0))
(on-redraw image)
(on-mouse-event mousey) ;; <==== NEW

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Wed, 18 Oct 2006 21:55:42 -0400
Reason>>> subtracted INSET from mouse click coordinates
