>Description:
In some circumstances, raising an error seems to cause
definitions from the definitions window not to be available in
the REPL.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do this in ASL:

(define x 10)
(check-expect (error "foo") 10)

Press "Run", then type x RET in the REPL. It says:

reference to undefined identifier: x
