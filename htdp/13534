(overlay (triangle 50 "solid" "white") (triangle 100 "solid" "black"))

produces a white triangle that is obviously off-center vertically wrt the underlying black triangle

 The distance from the top point of the white triangle to the top point of
 the black triangle is the same as the distance from the bottom of the white
 triangle to the bottom of the black one.
 
 It looks "wrong" to you because the left and right side of the remaining
 parts of the black triangle don't have as much thickness as the bottom. But
 that's not what centering means: it just means the bounding boxes are
 placed right on top of each other.
