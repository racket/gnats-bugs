>Description:
This came up in the irc channel, and I thought that the teaching languages
would clarify the problem as they usually do, but instead the error highlights
`and' and says that it doesn't follow an open paren -- which is wrong here...
The same kind of bad error message happens when, for example, `+' is used.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (sum-square-largest a b c)
  (cond (and (<= a b) (<= a c)) (+ (* b b) (* c c))
        (and (<= b a) (<= b c)) (+ (* a a) (* c c))
        (and (<= c a) (<= c b)) (+ (* a a) (* b b))

 Known error, and I believe an open bug report already.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by matthias at Wed, 10 Feb 2010 22:46:26 -0500
Reason>>> we need to figure this out


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by matthias at Wed, 01 Jun 2011 11:05:07 -0400
Reason>>> Guillaume is working on just these problems
