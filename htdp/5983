>Description:
(as in summary), also error message
seems a little ambigious, as to if the error
is the "unbound variable" named WIDTH in
an un-named module, or in an "unbound variable" in a module named WIDTH.

probably message should read:

unbound variable: WIDTH, in module: SOMEMODULENAMD (for named modules)
