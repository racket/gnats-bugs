 Why is that a bug? Looks like the right behavior to me.

 I didn't say it was a bug. Sam did. I just know it's not my thing :-)

 I see. So a change request, not a bug? Probably not for v370.

 Right. My question should have been more clearly for Sam. Sam?

 It's a bug because it breaks read-write invariance by default.
 
 For the teaching languages, sure, having it on by default is right.
 Otherwise, the whole point of print-convert is that (eval
 (print-convert x)) should produce something like x.  In this case,
 there's just a gratuitous error.

 Well, the docs for the print-convert library say:
 
 "
 This library defines routines for printing Scheme values as evaluable
 S-expressions rather than readable S-expressions. The print-convert
 procedure does not print values; rather, it converts a Scheme value
 into another Scheme value such that the new value pretty-prints as a
 Scheme expression that evaluates to the original value.
 "
 
 And then the docs give an example of how this is supposed to work.
 However, if you try the example with #f instead of 6, it will fail to
 eval properly.

 I disagree.  What is advertised is that print-convert-ed values can be
 eval'd, which in this case they cannot.

 That example would, I agree, not be a bug.  However, I think Java's
 use of curly braces is not like the bug we are discussing in important
 respects.

 Don't be ridiculous. I intentionally designed it that way. I agree it
 was the wrong choice, but it isn't a bug. Otherwise the word "bug"
 loses all meaning.
 
 You can say "it was a bug in your design" which is fine. But the bug
 isn't in the software.
