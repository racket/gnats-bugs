>Description:
In htdp/image.ss, could the structures be provided as:

(provide (struct-out color)
         (struct-out alpha-color))

Rather than:

(provide-primitives 
         ...
         make-color
         color-red
         color-green
         color-blue
         color?
         make-alpha-color
         alpha-color-alpha
         alpha-color-red
         alpha-color-green
         alpha-color-blue
         alpha-color?)

This would be more consistent with libraries like lang/posn, for example.

 Are you running into problems with the provides as they are? (I'm not
 sure if there is a reason for the provides as they are -- perhaps
 avoiding providing 'alpha-color' and 'color'.)

 No problems now (hence the "feature request"), but it means I can't use 
 the struct utilities of provide and require.  In particular, in wrapping 
 the student language in a typed module, I can't use require-typed-struct.

 If you want to make the change and then run the test suite and try out
 a few world-based programs and nothing goes wrong, I think you're safe
 to commit.
