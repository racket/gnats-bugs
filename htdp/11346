>Description:
car and cdr are found in *SL, but I believe there is no way to construct a value in the language itself that these can be used on.

The docs suggest cons is the only way to construct a pair.  Would it be worthwhile to add `pair' as a constructor of pairs that doesn't is what cons used to be?

 How so?
 
 (car (cons 1 empty))
 
 ... yields 1, as expected.

 I meant car/cdr as opposed to first/rest.  That is, in the pair sense.

 I think Shriram wants something like:
 
 (car (cons 1 2))
 
 where we are using 'cons' as a "pair" of two things

 Why not use=20
 
  (struct couple (l r))
 
 and define left and right as primitives.=20

 It sounded like he's complaining about `car' and `cdr' being uselessly
 included because he sees them as useful only in the presence of
 arbitrary pairs.  (And Mike is speaking a different language, where
 they're just mnemonics for `first' and `rest'.)

 Yes, Eli's right.  I later realized they are there for backward
 compatibility for old lispers.  Do we want to continue supporting
 that?

 Given that we get questions like "what is atom? -- it's used in TLS
 but not defined", aren't you just saying that TLS should get its own
 language, maybe with an entry alongside EoPL?

Responsible changed from "matthias" to "shriram" by matthias at Mon, 01 Nov 2010 09:56:08 -0400
Reason>>> not responsible 


State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Sun, 09 Jun 2013 14:29:05 -0400
Reason>>> car and cdr are there for legacy compatibility.
