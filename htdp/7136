>Description:
quicksort and member are both in student language,
but they behave in ways that aren't good for 
beginners (or intermediates or advanceds, for that
matter!). 

quicksort does not make sure the comparison function
passed in returns a boolean, and treats all non-false
values as true. That mystifies students who have
never been exposed to the notion that all-non-false
values are true.

member has a related problem. Rather than returning
true, it returns the pair whose head matched (a la
full Scheme's member function); this strange for
beginners and makes it hard to feed the output of
member into student-level cond, not, or other
constructs that in student level require a boolean.

 Great program seen in lab:
 
   (define-struct elf (age ...))
 
   (define (oldest a b)
     (cond
       [(< (elf-age a) (elf-age b)) b]
       [else a]))
 
   (quicksort my-list-of-elves oldest)
 
 The output from this program (filled in, of course) is totally
 baffling to the beginner.

 The teaching languages and the teachpacks pose a challenge for the 
 contract system. For every teachpack I write, I hand-roll contracts, 
 test them, and blame the student as appropriate. I can't use the 
 contracts that you use for other modules. I need more information than 
 contracts provide me so that I express blame properly. Now that we're 
 moving to a pure module system, this may become an interesting issue. 
 Both the teaching language proper and the teaching modules should use 
 the contract system -- they are just modules.
 
 Is it possible that the interface between teaching languages/modules 
 and student programs is different from other "glues" that we have 
 encountered and that it deserves an investigation/paper?

 I don't believe that. It's been my experience that the text of the
 error messages is the real stumbling block.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "matthias" by eli at Tue, 01 Feb 2005 20:11:32 -0500
Reason>>> htdp, seems like this involves robby & contracts, added to 
cc list.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Tue, 01 Mar 2005 18:06:34 -0500
Reason>>> added contracts to quicksort; changed member's range to boolean 
committed and tagged
