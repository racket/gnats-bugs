 Wouldn't you want something like
 
    (input-is "abc the file content xyz" expr)
 
 so that you could write
 
    (check-expect (output-from (input-is "abc the file content  
 xyz" (main 10)))
                  "the output of running main")

 Take a look at what I've done in the picturing-programs collection, file "iostuff.rkt".  If you have significantly better, friendlier ways to do this, I'm all ears....
