Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme\n" #t))
>Description:
Currently, using `image->color-list' changes the drawn representation of some images under Linux.  For example, this program prints *different* images for the two occurrences of `i':

#lang scheme
(require htdp/image)
(define i (circle 1 'solid 'red))
i
(image->color-list i)
i

The second `i' printout shows a blank image.  The `image->color-list' output is:
(#(struct:color 255 0 0) #(struct:color 255 0 0) #(struct:color 255 0 0) #(struct:color 255 0 0))

which is incorrect.

Based on some debugging in the source of "mrlib/cache-image-snip.ss", the problem appears to be in the conversion to an ARGB vector.  

The call to `get-argb' in `get-bitmap' produces this ARGB vector on Linux:
argb: #(255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0)
and this vector on OS X:
argb: #(0 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 0 0)

Beyond that, I wasn't able to track what was going on.

Reason>>> I think that this is a side-effect of the way drawing
happens and the particular (bad) combination of features in
the way htdp/image works. Specifically, any operation
(including equal? and image->color-list) that requires
inspection of the bits of the image changes its internal
representation by drawing the image and then using the
bitmap. Due to various unfortunate details that I don't
recall anymore, this has to happen in unsmoothed mode, which
is why the image looks different afterwards (you can see
this with larger circles; they get jaggy afterwards). 

I'm closing this because the right answer is "use
2htdp/image" and I don't know a good fix for htdp/image.

(I've removed the offending test case that inspired Sam's
investigation.)

Thanks for looking in this, tho.

 Is `2htdp/image' what's recommended for student use now?  I thought we
 were still recommending `htdp/image' for courses, but I'm not sure.

 But 2htdp/image is ready for use in the classroom, if people wish to
 make their own exercises.

 We are with htdp/image until I have rewritten 2e and all the programs.  
 That'll take a while.

 In this case, it seems bad that image equality doesn't work
 consistently for `htdp/image' on Linux.

 a: Your pr does not say anything about image equality and I don't see
 how it is connected to your pr.
 
 b: It seems bad to me that you complain this much without offering any
 solutions. Was I not clear that I don't know how to fix it and that I

 The test case I submitted uses `image->color-list', since that's
 simpler, but as you said, anything that uses the normalization, such
 as equality, observes the bug as well.  This means that programs that
 use `check-expect' with the same image value in multiple tests will
 fail on Linux.

 I don't have any immediate solutions, but closing the bug and removing
 the test case doesn't strike me as the right solution.  If we can't
 fix it now, that's not great, but all software has bugs, and we'll
 live.  But we should remember that this bug exists, rather than saying
 that it's not a bug.
 
 Also, since it works on OSX, perhaps the problem is at a lower layer,
 and needs to be fixed there, rather than in the image library.

 I don't see how this would happen. Perhaps an example would clarify or
 perhaps you have a different bug in mind than I do.

 This is a duplicate PR. A casual search turns up 8283 and 9123. It has

 Oh, forgot to reply to this part. I don't think that this will be
 productive. The problem is that the design of htdp/image forces it use
 a particular strategy in its implementation that's flawed. The correct
 fix is to use 2htdp/image, as I have said (another reason why I
 consider this bug report closed).

 Let me try to put this another way: unless you (or someone else) wants
 to take this bug on, there is no other, better "bug fix" that is going
 to happen.
 
 From my perspective, therefore, the "fix" is two fold:
 
  a) I made a new image library, whose design is, in part, about avoid
 this problem
 
  b) I declare that the current behavior of htdp/image is not a "bug"
 but just the way it works. You don't have to like it, but avoid
 struggling with this problem for many years (off and on again) the
 best approach, imo, is to declare it a feature.
 
 Either way, this PR should remain closed as far as I'm concerned.
 
 Does that make more sense?

 When I went back to create an example here, I discovered that the bug
 has actually been fixed.  The current output of `image->color-list' on
 linux in the example I reported is
 
 (#(struct:color 255 255 255) #(struct:color 255 255 255)
 #(struct:color 255 255 255) #(struct:color 255 255 255))
 
 Also, based on the rest of your responses, I suspect we're talking
 about different bugs, since the one I reported was almost certainly a
 bug in the Linux implementation of cached-image-snips, rather than in
 the image library at all.  However, since it's now fixed, that's
 really a moot point.

 Another possibility is that you ran the example before with a build
 that didn't have the GUI developer libraries installed (or you're
 doing that now).
 
 Anyways, the bug I know doesn't affect equality. The images are both
 "corrupted" or "jaggyizied" in the same way so equality still does
 (roughly) the right thing. Certainly if two images were constructed
 the same way, they'll always be equality. Overlays that you might
 expect to be equal won't always be (but no one has ever complained
 about that). And the "mutation" via image->color-list (or image
 comparison) is still with us and will be forever, as far as I can
 tell.

 I can't build DrScheme without them, so that seems unlikely.

 We're definitely talking about different bugs, then.  The bug I
 reported was that mrlib/cache-image-snip behaved differently on OSX
 and Linux, which meant that the mutation changed the image to a
 totally blank image, rather than a jaggier image.

 Right, that's what I meant too.  cairo is necessary for the build on linux.

 Yeah, the bug was fixed at some point, so it should certainly be closed.

 Sorry for my lack of specificity. I mean cairo.

 That seems like a relatively recent change, then, since drdr didn't
 have it installed a few months ago and was building okay. (I've also
 built without cairo myself, but before that.)

 Ah, right.  I was remembering incorrectly - it's not necessary, but it
 disables certain code when you don't have it.  But either way, I've
 definitely had it installed for all my builds of DrScheme.  I expect
 this bug got fixed either by some change Matthew made to MrEd, or by
 some fix lower down in the stack.
