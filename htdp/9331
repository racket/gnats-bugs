>Description:
The image teachpack (combined with my tiles teachpack) makes it fairly easy to do all sorts of manipulations on images, but there's no straightforward way to save the result as an image file (say, GIF or PNG).  I guess one could do it as a saveable animation with only one frame...

Or is it already in there, and I'm just not finding it in the documentation (or the source code)?

 You could write a 3-line function that abbreviates the animated image  
 save.

 True; it would require the animation teachpack, which seems silly, 
 but yes, one could certainly do that.
