>Description:
I'm grading a student's homework, and I hit "Run".  One of the student's test cases fails, so I get a window reporting that fact.  Then I close that window, and type a simple expression (like, say, 2) into the Interactions pane, and the check-expect-failure window comes up again, with two empty boxes as the "actual value" and "expected value".  And again.  Every time I hit ENTER in the interactions pane.
>How-To-Repeat:
I've reduced it to the following in the Definitions pane:

(require picturing-programs)
(check-expect (doubledot 20 2)
              (beside (circle 15 "solid" "red")(circle 15 "solid" "red")(circle 15 "solid" "red")(circle 15 "solid" "red")))

(define (doubledot radius amount)
  (beside (circle radius "solid" "red")(circle radius "solid" "red")))
