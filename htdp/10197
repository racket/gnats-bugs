In any of the student langs:

(sinh "a")
exp: expects argument of type <number>; given "a"

(sgn "a")
exact?: expects argument of type <number>; given "a"

(conjugate "a")

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by matthias at Tue, 14 Apr 2009 18:06:39 -0400
Reason>>> i started fixing the beginning student languages (checked in sqr)
but then i realized that these error messages are bad for "adults", too, 
and matthew should fix the mzlib/math library. 

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by matthias at Tue, 14 Apr 2009 18:06:39 -0400
Reason>>> see above


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 08 Jan 2010 08:50:31 -0500
Reason>>> fixed
