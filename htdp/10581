>Description:
Here is the way to reproduce the bug: 

(require htdp/image)

;; docs: "The text function puts the pinhole at the upper left corner of the image, ..."

(pinhole-y (text "" 11 'black))
;; produces 6 on my Mac 

-- Matthias
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
the text function calls rectangle with a zero width and returns that result when the string is empty. It needed to also adjust the pinhole.
>Release-Note:
This could have been a contract error, if the contract for text had included a pinhole spec.

This could not have been a type error, unless the type system could incode the pinhole spec (which seems unlikely).
