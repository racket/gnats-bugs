>Description:
I would like to use add1 as a procedure of 1 argument that I can pass to special exports from teachpacks (that may consume higher order functions). 

When I do this I get the following error message: 
add1: this primitive operator must be applied to arguments; expected an open parenthesis before the primitive operator name

;; Example: Beginning Student with world.ss

(define (d i) (circle (* 10 i) 'solid 'red))
(define (n x) (add1 x))
;; --- 
(big-bang 100 100 1.0 1)
(on-redraw d)
(on-tick-event n)
;; the above works but 
; (on-tick-event add1)
;; doesn't.
