>Description:
I hope this is an appropriate mechanism for suggesting improvements to DrRacket.

When using 2htdp/universe, many of my students are trying to name the mouse-event handler `on-mouse`, and similar solecism.  They get a generic error message, which they don't understand at all.  It would help tremeendously to have a customized error message for BSL students who try to rename the functions used to pass handlers to `big-bang`.

Also more generally, it would help students to know instead of 'defined previously', one of

  - Defined on line 32
  - Defined in the 2htdp/universe teachpack
  - Defined as part of <insert language name here>
>How-To-Repeat:
1. (define (on-mouse button 0))
2. Click Check Syntax.
3. Be confused about claim of 'defined previously' when the Definitions window manifestly contains only the one definition.

 Thinking out loud: This isn't about DrRacket but the teaching languages and the require they inherit from Racket, though one could special-case it in DrRacket for the teaching languages. 
 
 So the problem is one of: 
  [1] *SL implementation 
  [2] DrRacket special-casing of *SL 
  [3] Racket implementation because ordinary Racket programmers would benefit from this improvement too 
 	and *SL inherits this behavior 
 
 I think [3] is our best bet.
