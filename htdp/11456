>Description:
If I overlay a composed image with one of its component images, I should get back the original image (assuming the alignment is correct).  But if the image has pixels that are transparent, this doesn't work.

In particular, I'm using an outline rectangle as a "frame" and placing or overlaying other images into that frame, and I expect that if I overlay the outline rectangle again, it should have no effect, whatever order the overlay occurs, because the only nontransparent pixels in that frame should be the same in the composed image.

The composed images are considered equal? as long as they are composed in the same order.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/image)

(define base (rectangle 20 20 "outline" "blue"))

(define combo (overlay/align "middle" "middle"
                             base
                             (circle 3 "solid" "red") ))

(check-expect combo combo)
(check-expect (overlay/align "middle" "middle" base combo) combo)
(check-expect (overlay combo base) combo)
(check-expect (overlay base combo) combo)
(check-expect (overlay base combo) (overlay base combo))
(check-expect (overlay base combo) (overlay combo base))

Note that if base is "solid", all test cases pass.

 Unfortunately, this is just not true for the way image drawing works
 on computers these days. More specifically, if I draw, say, a circle
 at the same place twice, it is not the same as drawing that circle
 only once because the second circle's background is not the plain
 background anymore, so the edge pixels are going to be drawn
 differently.
 
 You may wish to argue that overlaying shapes should have this property
 and I would disagree with you, but that's not something that the
 2htdp/image library is going to be able to help you with.

 That's because the dot is obscured.

 OOPS! I mean "would NOT disagree" with you!

nothing to be done, I believe and no response to my email to
contradict that belief....
