>Description:
One of my students wrote an animation with a string model, initially "", and a draw handler that uses text to build a picture of it.  On running, he got the cryptic error message

"send: target is not an object: false for method: get-loaded-mask"

When he provided explicit dimensions for the animation window, using the optional arguments to on-draw, it worked.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define(typing-image model)
     (text model 18 "blue"))
(big-bang ""
          (on-draw typing-image #;500 #;50))

The problem arises in both 4.2.2 and 4.2.5, and presumably in between.  It arises both with my picturing-programs teachpack and with the bundled universe teachpacks.

The same happens in the program
(define (show-it pic) pic)
(big-bang (rectangle 0 0 "solid" "purple")
          (on-draw show-it))
>Fix:
zero-sized htdp/image images did not play well with 2htdp/image primitives (which universe uses). In particular, a zero-sized htdp/image image returns #f from its get-bitmap method. In principle, this problem could also have been caused by an image-snip inserted into a program where the image-snip had no bitmap, but this would be quite strange and I'm not sure how you'd do it without calling (make-object image-snip% ...) yourself.
>Release-Note:
A type system probably would have caught this. A contract did catch it.

 Very strange.  I just tried each of those two code snippets again, on =
 4.2.5, running MacOS 10.6.3, with the "image" and "universe" teachpacks =
 loaded (not my teachpack), and the bug DOES exist.

 I don't know what to say but I have no tried this on Leopard and Snow  
 Leopard, on the released version and the svn head (right) and I can't  
 reproduce it.

 Steve , can you send us very precise instructions on what you did,
 starting with "start up drs" and the precise output that you see?
 
 Thanks,

 OK, here we go.

Reason>>> I was able to turn the bug into a simple 2htdp/image bug: 

#lang scheme 

(require htdp/image)
(require (prefix-in 2: 2htdp/private/universe-image))

(define (typing-image model) (text model 18 "blue"))

(2:image? (typing-image ""))

;; the #t result implies that I can ask for image width using 2: functions: 
 (2:image-width (typing-image ""))

 Which means as soon as we can ditch htdp/image in favor of 2htdp/image, =
 the problem is solved, right?
 
 Do we have an estimate of how far we are from that blissful state?  It =
 would be particularly nice if universe worked smoothly with 2htdp/image =
 in time for me to rewrite the book and teachpack before Fall Semester.  =
 Even better, before the summer workshops :-)

 The two were decoupled a while back. The very fact that you have to  
 request the two teachpacks separately is one consequence. How 'smooth'  
 it is I will leave to you to judge.
