>Description:
The teachpack error message from elevator for the arity
check has bad english and it doesn't check properly.

>How-To-Repeat:
- set language to full scheme.
- set the teachpack to plt/teachpacks/htdp/elevator.ss
- put this in the definitions window:
(define (f . x) (write x) (newline))
(run f)
- click execute

get this error message:

run: procedure of three expected as first argument; given procedure of #<struct:arity-at-least> arguments

two problems:

1) "procedure of three expected" -- three what?
2) this procedure should be okay.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
>Unformatted:
 
 Changed elevator.ss to take care of problem 1. 
 Changed error.ss to take of problem 2. I am not 
 sure that this is truly good idea, because students 
 can accidentally pass in list and functions with funny 
 arity like that. This would catch the error too late.
