>Description:
The teachpack pingp-play.ss in plt/teachpacks/htdp gives
an error when it is installed. It contains this:

  (require-library "pingp-play.ss" "htdp")

but there is no pingp-play.ss file in the htdp collection.

(Perhaps there is a tagging mistake somewhere or a file
didn't get added?)

The same happens for protect-play.ss
