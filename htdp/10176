>Description:
While using the Universe Teachpack in the intermediate student with lambda language, if input syntax is NOT case sensitive in the server and IS case sensitive in the client, the client will not be able to connect to the server. No message is displayed on either side; the client simply hangs.

I am using Ubuntu 8.10 and the latest SVN version of drscheme, but I was seeing this problem in previous versions as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can reproduce this easily with a client/universe file where the code in the universe file is:
(universe empty
          (on-new (lambda (x y z) (make-bundle (cons z x) y empty)))
          (on-msg (lambda (x y z w) (make-bundle x y empty))))
and the case sensitive box under input syntax in options is unchecked.

The code for the client can be:
(big-bang empty 
          (register "127.0.0.1"))
and the case sensitive box under input syntax in options is checked.

 If the box was checked w/o your explicit action, the bug has been  
 eliminated.
 
 If you intentionally chose to run one client in CS mode and the other  
 one in CU mode, I don't know what to say (yet).
