>Description:
run 

(define (foo x)
  (+ x 1))

(let* ((a (random 1000)))
  (check-expect (foo a) (+ a 1)))
  
get this: "begin (possibly implicit): no expression after a sequence of internal definitions"

Can we just say that check-expect is only a top-level form until we have figured out what it should do properly? 

This should also be documented as such.
