>Description:
The Intermediate Student language provides `pair?'.  However, one of the HTDP exercises (19.2.3) defines a `pair' struct, which therefore doesn't work.

There's no reason to expose `pair?' in Intermediate Student as an alias for `cons?'.

 I believe that pair? and friends are included in these languages for  
 people who wish to use the teaching languages but use alternative  
 books. e.g., Little Schemer, Concrete Abstractions, etc. For the same  
 reason, we allow
 
   (define f (lambda (x) ...))
 
 in BSL.
 
 I am afraid HtDP went to print too early :-)

 If we have a text book that encourages the use of a particular
 language, that language should then work for the exercises for the
 book.  Supporting other books should be a secondary goal.  If people
 want to use a different book, we should provide the support we can,
 but not to the point of breaking it for HtDP.  That's just
 unreasonable.  What should I say to my students?

 We made a mistake and in allowing pair? back in. We'll do better next  
 time, perhaps.

 Why can't we just take it back out?  It seems like the choice is
 between breaking HtDP and breaking some other book?  Why is the other
 book getting priority here?

 We don't know who is using it and in what ways, and past experience
 suggests that this particular compromise isn't worth revisiting.
 
 Maybe it's worth cleaning up the language when we shift to using HtDP
 with `#lang htdp/beginner'.

 I understand why this wouldn't be worth the fight for something like
 Indiana-style definitions, where it's not breaking our courses and our
 book.  But right now there's no way to tell from the book or the
 language documentation that this won't work.  What do the solutions
 for that exercise say at the moment?  Do they just fail to compile?
