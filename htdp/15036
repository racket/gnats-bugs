>Description:
1. Re:
  "• Case-sensitive identifiers and symbols [...] The teaching languages are case-sensitive by default, and other languages are usually case-insensitive."
The claim that other languages are usually case-insensitive is false, so consider removing that claim.

2. Re:
  "• lambda allowed only in definitions [...] lambda (or case-lambda)"
Since  case-lambda  is not in the teaching languages, I suggest removing the mention of it.

3. Re:
  "• Conditional values must be true or false [...]"
Now that  #true  and  #false  are the canonical representations, consider using those instead, here and elsewhere in the page.

4. Re:
  "• Conditional values must be true or false [...] This restriction, which applies to if, cond, and, or, nand, and nor expressions"
Neither  nand  nor  nor  are in the teaching languages, so I suggest removing the mention of them, here and elsewhere in the page.

5. Re:
  "• +, *, and / take at least two arguments [...]"
This is false except in BSL.
