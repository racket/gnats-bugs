>Description:
If you hit a run-time error during a Universe big-bang, there's a printf.  Either it was left in by mistake, or it's intentional but should then be more graceful in its prose.  See "breaking .." below.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-struct world (plane fuel))
(define init-w (make-world (make-posn 0 0) 30))
(define (fake w) (posn-x w))
(big-bang init-w [on-tick fake])

produces

breaking ..
posn-x: expects argument of type <struct:posn>; given (make-world (make-posn 0 0) 30)
