 Our implemented semantics doesn't match the semantics we teach to
 students. (local ...) isn't really implemented by moving the
 definitions to the top level (with renaming). Instead, `local' is
 `letrec'. The beginner only allows primitive operations and (globally)
 defined names after a parenthesis.
 
 Or is it that the beginner semantics doesn't have `local'?

 The lifting is a red herring. By the time they hear that, they use
 Intermediate. By then we can't check func apps like this anymore. 
 
 Beginner does and doesn't have LOCAL available. Officially: no. 
 Inofficially: yes. That's where DRScheme's confusion comes in.

 Actually, we officially have local in the beginner level. Only 210-like
 courses don't tell the students that. According to our documentation we do
 have binding forms in the beginner level.
 
 So, I think that this is an actual bug and we should try to fix it.

 local, let should be taken out of Beginner. That's one way to fix it.

 But, I thought we were of the official opinion that other teachers may want
 to use binding forms at the beginner level, so we include them. Perhaps we
 should come to an official opion on that and then proceed? Maybe on
 Wednesday we can decide?

 Strictly speaking, local and let are okay: the problem arises when the
 names are bound to procedures (ie, that's when the error-flagging
 is invalid).  Beginners aren't going to use LET for this purpose; they
 will use LOCAL, though.
 
 Perhaps the right solution is a 'baby level where let and local don't
 exist, and one level up where they do and the restriction is
 eliminated?

 We never got a reply on this -- I think that the difference between
 intermediate and beginner is pretty small as it is, so we can just make
 beginner be that baby level. People who want to teach scope right away can
 have structures in the language right away as well.
