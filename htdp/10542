>Description:
A number of TS! teachers have expressed an interest in using enforced contracts in their beginning courses.  Could we please have (simple forms of) define/contract and define-struct/contract added to the student languages, so teachers have this option?

I tried (require scheme/contract) in BSL, and it then recognized define-struct/contract and define/contract, but refused to allow type predicates in argument positions, which makes contracts useless.  The same code works in ISL, so I guess if you don't want to introduce enforced contracts until ISL, the status quo is OK.

It seems to me that define/contract and define-struct/contract aren't the sorts of things students will trip over by accident, so there should be no harm in including them.

 The tentative plan we formed at ICFP (if I remember correctly) was that,
 once lazy contract checking for record contracts is finished for the
 DeinProgramm/DMdA teaching languages (currently in the works), we'd port
 that contract support over to the HtDP.  It's a significant project,
 though, so it will likely be a few months yet.
