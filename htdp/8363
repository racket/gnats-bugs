 FWIW, the right solution to this might be to change all of the image.ss
 contracts so that they allow all numbers (and then take the floor to
 get integers).
 
 What do you think?

 I think that's the right solution for the next release. For now I  
 feel like checking for integerness myself.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Tue, 31 Oct 2006 23:18:18 -0500
Reason>>> place-image now accepts integers only
