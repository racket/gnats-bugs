>Description:
When using placeimage or placeimage/align the code seems to crop or expand the image and place the border of the image outside the visible range. 

This system is Vista 64bit on an AMD Quad Core 64bit with 4G of RAM. 

I have validated the code on x86-32 bit Ubuntu Linux produces the desired result. 

I can provide the image I receive as a result
>How-To-Repeat:
use the following code snippet

(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

(define CIRC 
  (circle 5 "solid" "red"))

(define RECT
  (rectangle 100 100 "outline" "green"))

(define TEST-PLACE-IMAGE
  (place-image/align
   CIRC
   50 
   50
   "center"
   "center"
   RECT))

 I see the expected behavior in 5.0.2 under windows 7. What I see is
 the upper and left-hand lines of a green rectangle and a smallish red
 circle in the middle. Is that what you're seeing?
 
 If so, then what you're seeing is the current result. To understand
 why, you should look at the docs for place-image, where you will see
 that it crops the result to the bounding box. Then, you should look at
 this section of the docs:
 
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html?q=2htdp/image#%28part._nitty-gritty%29
 
 for an explanation of why the bottom and right-hand edge of the image goes away.
 
 As to why you're seeing something different under linux I'm not sure.
 What are you seeing there?

 Yes, that would be quite helpful. I'm not completely clear what you're
 seeing and what you're expecting and the difference and I expect a
 screenshot (or two) would help me really understand.

 hi Robby, 
 
 In Linux, I see the bounded box correctly. 
 
 Do you need images? 
 
 Thanks

 hi Robby, 
 
 if I may, I am going to need a week (most likely next friday), before I am able to update the bug. 
 
 Thank you

 No problem! Thank you for your time and energy in helping to get this
 all straightened out. No rush.

 hi Robby, 
 
 Here is the generated image on amd64 / vista. 
 On Ubuntu Linux I see the green border all the way around. 
 
 Thanks

 Looks like the linux version is the wrong one. The original PR says
 you were using 5.0.2; that's still the version you're using for the
 screenshots, right?

 I just tried it the latest build on ubuntu and it looks the same as
 your screenshot (ie correct), so I'll close this PR. If there is
 something else still wrong, we can re-open it (or feel free to submit
 another one).
