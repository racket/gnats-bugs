>Description:
In the documentation for 2htdp/universe regarding connecting a client, it says:

"A big-bang description of a world program that wishes to communicate with other programs must contain a register clause of one of the following shapes:

(register ip-expr)	...
(name name-expr)	..."
 
This makes it sound like the register and name clauses are alternatives for connecting to a server.
