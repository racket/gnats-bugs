>Description:
(I think this is what Shriram ran into, formulated as a bug report.) 

When I use both the world.ss and hangman.ss teachpack in Intermediate, I get this error message: 

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.0.2.3-svn15jul2008 [3m].
Language: Intermediate Student with lambda custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
Teachpack: hangman.ss.
module: identifier already imported from a different source

That's rather unhelpful for beginners. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Use this program: 

(require (lib "world.ss" "htdp")) ;; click RUN, fine 

2. Add teachpack --> hangman.ss 

3. Click RUN. Get above error message.

 Is this a drscheme-level issue of a teaching language impl. one? For
 this module:
 
 (module m lang/htdp-beginner
   (require (lib "world.ss" "htdp"))
   (require (lib "hangman.ss" "htdp")))
 
 
 I get this (in the Module langauge)
 
 module: identifier already imported from a different source in:
   on-key-event
   (lib "hangman.ss" "htdp")
   (lib "world.ss" "htdp")
 which seems like a reasonable message, but in the teaching languages
 this gets turned into a syntax error for the invisible part of the
 program (the implicit require).
 
 the explicit version of the beginner error message isn't very good
 either, ie using this program with drscheme's langauge set to
 beginning student:
 
   (require (lib "world.ss" "htdp"))
   (require (lib "hangman.ss" "htdp"))
 
 highlights well, but gives this error message:
 
   module: identifier already imported from a different source
 
 which doesn't at all seem clear anymore.
