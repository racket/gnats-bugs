In BSL it is possible to reference struct type names without throwing an error; such a reference evaluates to a (make-signature ...) which is opaque to students.

This leads to struct accessors producing cryptic error messages in BSL.

 If we eliminate this problem from BSL, would this help? Some people do use checked signatures but they aren't supported at the BSL/BSL+ level. Nevertheless if you raise the language level to ISL, you will see these kinds of errors too.

 Ah -- the connection to the checked-signatures facility hadn't occurred to me.
 
 It seems sensible to eliminate it in BSL/BSL+, if the signatures aren't used there.  I don't see a way to eliminate the problem -- which came up in this case only because a student's typo happened to be the same as a struct type name -- in the presence of a need to allow use of the bare struct type name.
 
 A more obviously struct-linked name than "signature" -- e.g., "struct-class" or "struct-name" or "struct-def" -- might make it easier to understand an erroneous reference like the one my students encountered.
 
 Best,
 Jordan

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Wed, 05 Aug 2015 10:13:13 -0400
Reason>>> This was changed to an error a long time ago: "X: structure type; do you mean 
make-X"
