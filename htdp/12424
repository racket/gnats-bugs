 I don't see a way to fix this without calling collection-file-path, which
 means that the error reporting will be less than ideal. Is there a better
 way? If not, I guess I can catch the exceptions and re-raise them after
 regexp-munging on the strings?
 
 Or is that too gross? If so, I could adjust collection-file-path to take a
 keyword argument to specify what to do on (certain kinds of) failures. I
 see that its defined in src/startup.rktl, tho, so maybe keywords aren't
 around yet?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Keywords are definitely not around there.  Maybe an option
 continuation as the first argument (ewww)?

 Not sure that's better than regexp munging the error string :)

 This is turning out to be a pain for our class, so any sort of fix
 would be appreciated.  Maybe you can try what you're doing now, and if
 that doesn't find anything, call `collection-file-paths'.
