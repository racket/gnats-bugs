>Description:
i just debugged guess.ss and as i was testing the teachpack
i realized that it didn't automatically ask for another
game. 

as i continued looking into the story, i realized that the
problem is that teachpacks used to be added in a CS manner
and now they no longer are. 

once i prefixed the module with #cs, things worked fine. 

who should fix this? should i prefix them all with #cs
or should robby make them cs?

 You must put #cs, I think. That works better, I think. Its less
 confusing if a teachpack isn't special, imho. Certainly you want to be
 able to develop them in the module language, and use other tools on
 them, so if they were special that wouldn't work properly.
