>Description:
The following two functions are improperly documented:

(mouse-event? x) → boolean?
  x : any
determines whether x is a KeyEvent

(mouse=? x y) → boolean?
  x : mouse-event?
  y : mouse-event?
compares two KeyEvent for equality

at http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/html/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28tech._mouseevent%29

It should say MouseEvent and not KeyEvent.
