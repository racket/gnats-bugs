>Description:
A graphic display is itself only an approximation of part of physical (i.e. inexact) reality, which furthermore imposes an integer grid due to hardware limitations.  Besides, even if the radius of a circle happens to be an exact integer, the coordinates of its edge points will be neither exact nor integers anyway.

I propose that the image.ss library treat all its incoming numbers -- coordinates, radii, offsets, and color values -- as though they had an implicit (inexact->exact (round ...)) around them.

This will have the pedagogical benefit that one can use more interesting mathematical functions in an animation without futzing with round and inexact->exact; there are better-motivated times to talk about these issues.

 This is planned for the next release (altho I think floor works out
 better than round, since it matches what the rest of the toolkit
 does).

 Floor sounds good to me... but if so, it becomes even more important 
 to allow 0 as a dimension (as I've suggested in a different change 
 request).  Imagine: you draw a circle whose radius comes from a 
 computation that mathematically should produce 1, but it's inexact 
 and comes out .9999, so it gets floored to 0 and the program crashes.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 04 May 2007 03:33:25 -0400
Reason>>> maybe closed by now?


State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 04 May 2007 08:03:32 -0400
Reason>>> this has been fixed for the next release.

But there are still no zero-sized images allowed.
