 I'm not so sure about that. I like being able to show/use the `list'
 shorthand as input before switching the output mode, and I've seen
 students intentionally stick to `cons' output even when code that I
 give them uses `list'.
 
 Is there a different solution?

 I have never thought of separating list for input and output.
 I always thought that Beginner just rules out list completely.

 I don't know, but we see the usual confusion in weaker students.
 In a way, I'd like to tell them "drop back to Beginner". List is
 only for people who have understood the concept.

Reason>>> I have removed list? and left list in beginner, following Matthew's request. If I 
encounter problems again in the fall, I may remove list, too.
