>Description:
Names and conventions matter.  People ask "How does one program in this language?", by which they also mean what the syntactic conventions are.  This includes indentation, all-close-parens-on-one-line, and caps.

Racket is not a CamelCase language; it just isn't, and making it so would require changing extensive numbers of primitives.  But signatures are a new thing, and they're not used in all conventional value positions, so they could have their own rules.  Unfortunately, they are already in a confused state.

Right now signatures have TWO conventions:

- For defined structures, use the name of the struct.
- For pre-defined signatures, use init caps (String, Number, etc).

These two are inconsistent.  Forcing people to capitalize the names of structure definitions is not straightforward either, because it makes the rest of the code very ugly:

(define-struct Cow (a b))
(make-Cow 1 2)

is not conventional-looking, either.  Worse, we currently have two different defaults already, because String and Number are caps (so they "look" like signatures), but posn is not (so it doesn't).

I'd like to suggest that signature definitions be automatically init-capitalized unless they already have an init cap (in which case we leave the caps alone, since they might be CamelCased).  Of course, this requires knowing when a signature binding is taking place.  But having used signatures for a week now,  I find the current system far too ugly to look at, and hard to explain to students.

 than a PR to me.

 And a PR is different because you are going to make Ryan now close it inste=
 ad?
 
 If you take a look at the current state of the PRs, I think you'll
 find that making something a PR does not help significantly in this
 regard.

 This is also the convention for Typed Racket.  All types are have
 Initial-Capitals, except structs which are traditionally lowercased.
 I've been unhappy with this inconsistency, but I haven't found a good
 alternative.  It might be possible to have
 
 (struct: foo ([x : Any])
 
 also define `Foo' as the type (or signature) name, but that seems
 unexpected and not in keeping with the rest of the language.  But I
 don't have a better suggestion.

 That does seem a bit better, tho. Especially now that 'foo' is also a
 constructor (so there's a little bit less overloading-looking stuff).

 The suggestion to auto-capitalize.  Since in
 
 (struct foo (x y))
 
 (foo ...) is now a constructor, it can't also be the "type name".

 Yes, thanks. I meant that in Shriram's example below "Foo" becomes the

 But another problem with this is that not all language have a notion
 of capital letter, so our convention would have to be flexible enough
 to accomodate the case where capitalizing a word does not change the
 word. That seems doable, tho (and likely a source of Chinese in our
 test cases ;).

 I wondered about that, specifically, what char-upcase does.  It says
 
   Produces a character consistent with the 1-to-1 code point mapping
 defined by Unicode. If char has no upcase mapping, char-upcase
 produces char.
 
 So I guess this isn't really a solution...

 [[ I dislike the use of bug reports for feature discussions. ]]
 
 I struggled with this problem as soon as checked signatures 'slipped' =
 into the code base for HtDP, long before Shriram started throwing them =
 at his class. (I know I am brave, I would never have been that brave.)=20=
 
 
 There are even more problems than have been mentioned. In=20
 
  (define-struct s (f g h))
 
 s can serve as some syntax-info repository
 s can serve as the name of the signature=20
 s can serve as a constructor name=20
 
 Plus *sl struct defs have their own definitions. They aren't really =
 plain Racket structs.=20
 
 ;; ---=20
 
 Here is my idea: I think we should introduce a checked define-struct. =
 Perhaps we could just use a ";" or a "/c" to indicate that the =
 define-struct is different. In addition, I would ask students to =
 introduce a separate name for the signature. For example,=20
 
  (define-struct: s ({f : Number} {g : String}) : Address)=20
 
 would introduce a struct that combines a Number and a String into an =
 Address. That would scale to Typed Racket and we might even be able to =
 reuse its parser. It avoids the silly-looking and typing-intensive =
 specification of constructors, selectors, and predicates. This also =
 leaves us free to use=20
 
  (s 42 "hello")

 I sure hope that's a typo, and you meant ":", not ";".
 
 I do not like the DMdA style of making all the names explicit, so we
 can agree on that.  Interestingly, I did show my students
 
 (define-struct foo (bar baz))
 (: make-foo (Number Number -> String))
 (: foo-bar (foo -> Number))
 etc.
 
 and they seem to have picked up on it.  That is, they don't mind
 enumerating the names for the purpose of giving them contracts,
 especially since the contracts are checked.  But writing out all the
 structures in full would not fly, even less so in Bootstrap (where
 time is limited and students are not expert typists).

 I LIKE THIS!
 
 I presume, in many cases, we will have
 
 (define-struct: <constructor name> <field-spec> <CamelCaseVersionOfConstruc=
 tor>)
 
 as in
 
 (define-struct posn ({x : Number} {y : Number}) : Posn)
 
 I'm glad you are stating consistency w/ TR as a principle.  Can we do
 the same for "type" variables also?  Right now TR lists them
 explicitly as variables, whereas because signatures don't have a
 binding form, it uses the %a, %b, ... convention.  I'd rather they did
 the same thing (reusing parsers, again, is great), and personally I
 prefer the TR notation to having to explain where %a, ... came from.

 I agree with your superficial point (that it is trivial to support),
 but if they are truly ignored, it is wrong to permit the variables at
 all.  Instead all those %x's should be Any.  That way people will not
 assume a protection that the syntax suggests but does not deliver.

 I think that Mike considers these to be akin to comments in
 documentation, ie useful annotations to have right inline. Enough
 utility and enough pain to try to put comments there that it is worth
 it to have multiple names for "any" in this context. (Speaking

 On the contrary, I think it's very valuable to get students to
 understand that what they *want* to write is
 
 (: all ((%a -> %b) (list-of %a) -> (list-of %b)))
 
 but all they *can* write is

 and then show them that when they go to Typed Racket, the previous
 contract (syntactically modified) will not only work but also do the
 right thing, so they get more enforcement power (for now).
 
 This is an important teaching moment, and not a good time to have to

 %a and %b as if they are being checked for consistency?"
 
 The comment analogy doesn't work for me, either.  To me,

 Having different type variables allows you to talk about signatures of
 things like fold, where two different type variables occur.  The
 difference is not checked, but the discussion is meaningful, and quite
 successful with the students.  (I.e. many can properly write signatures
 with different type variables.)  The underlying idea is, of course, that
 when switching to a type system, the difference becomes meaningful.

 You're only discussing the many *correct* cases.  The fact that you
 can write the WRONG contract and it works just the same is a turn-off.
 At least with my students, it would be a disaster.  I don't think a
 formal system should strongly hint at distinctions it can't support.

 Two questions in the spirit of Guillaume's dissertation:
 
  Mike: do you have experience (grading papers or the like) relevant to this=
 ?
 
  Shriram: do you have any evidence for your claims about your class?

 That's the right question, thanks.
 
 I have plenty of anecdotal evidence about my students.  However, my
 feeling is that it's the burden of the curriculum provider to
 substantiate such claims, when they run contrary to an academic
 principle.

 Well, just my $0.02, but I can kind of get behind that sentiment if
 you were to drop the clause following the last comma (but not really
 otherwise).

 That's fine.  I added the clause because I'm not arguing the entire
 kit and kaboodle, only this part.
 
 (I can accept the choice of define vs define-signature as a design
 decision on which reasonable people can disagree.  I know how to
 discuss and defend it.  I don't know how to discuss or defend this one
 because it runs contrary to even what I would want, and it's hard to
 teach with a language you disagree with.)

 How else are you going to find out if you or Mike is right without
 being able to honestly give it a try?
 
 Just on the evidence-less parts of the arguments put forth so far, I
 don't see a clear winner.

 Did you not read what I wrote in parens?  I do not believe in it and
 therefore cannot defend it?
 
 I believe your proposal is that I'm supposed to teach with it, have a
 mess in class, then gather statistics, do some kind of validity test,
 and then you will believe me, but not before that?  (Even then, why
 would you believe me?  You'd argue I messed up the lecture on purpose,
 so maybe another person should teach the same audience to be sure.)
 
 This part of contracts is, on its face, broken.  The burden's on the
 person who puts out the broken thing, just like if Matthew were to
 decide tomorrow that GC is overrated or safety checks are overrated,
 and he's taking them away.
 
 The rest of the contract system is not broken -- it's working very
 nicely, actually!  I'm happy to have experimented with it.

 Let me clarify this a bit.  Why would my students even know this is
 broken?  A handful would try it out themselves.  But it is also
 precisely my teaching (and writing) style to ask them to write the
 broken versions and to see what happens.
 
 I like teaching in Racket because broken things report as broken:
 
   (+ 1 true)
 
 is not 2, it's an error; and things that shouldn't be broken aren't:
 
   (expt 2 10000)
 
 doesn't give a small negative number, or something like that.
 
 Of course, there are static and there are dynamic errors.  This is
 something we not only have a good account of, our account grows better
 and better (nothing -> contracts -> types, all demonstrable within the
 "same" language, more-or-less).  This is really important, core,
 computer science stuff, and we get to teach it to froshes.
 
 The "contract variable" mechanism breaks neither statically nor
 dynamically even when there is an error.  To me, that's a bug.
 
 Furthermore, this principle of removing those bugs that other
 languages have and teach about is one of THE most important things
 that attracts people to teaching with Racket.  We would be making a
 grave error to not recognize and sustain that.

 Yes.  The truth is somewhere in between: People got much better at
 writing correct signatures than when the contracts were comments, but
 not as good as they would become if it were checked.  I have no problem
 with anyone using `any' - this is just our experience.

 That's fine.  I suggest you try exactly that and then, when they see
 that the system drops the ball, blame it on "the guy from Germany" and
 tell them that you hold them to higher standards.  (I don't mean this
 ironically at all.  Having them figure out the incompetence of "the Java
 people" in the 2nd semester has been wildly successful for us.)

 I wish it were that simple.  The whole point of the course is that we
 can offer a *counter-point* to the brokenness of the world:
 
 http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2010/readme
 
 It's fine to say "This year we're using something highly experimental,
 so things won't work quite as expected" -- we did that with phones
 last year, we're doing it with your contracts this year, and the
 students are great about rolling with the punches.  But brokenness in
 the language is another thing.
 
 Let me offer a concrete proposal.
 
 1. Add an Any contract (trivial?) that has the same syntax and intent
 as that of Typed Racket.
 
 2. In the docs for %a or whatever you decide to call it (in fact, if
 the semantics is different from that of TR, maybe a different syntax
 is the RIGHT thing!), explicitly say that these don't work.  Right now
 the docs do not say that, and surely you can agree that at least
 *that* is a true problem.
 
 I have some students who are very adventurous about looking up and
 trying things.  They deserve a warning that this notation doesn't
 actually do any enforcing.
 
 These two changes will be plenty enough to accomplish my curricular
 goals, while seemingly being compatible with yours.
