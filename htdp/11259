>Description:
When using place-image function from 2htdp/image to place some image into a outline rectangle, the bottom and right borders will not be displayed. If using the function to place some image into a outline circle, there will be some part of the outline circle missing, which seems to be the tangent parts between the circle and the bottom and right borders.
This phenomenon is platform dependent. I'm using Windows XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run DrRacket (the nightly build) on Windows XP.
2. Type 
(place-image (circle 3 "solid" "red") 3 3
 (rectangle 31 21 "outline" "black")) into the interaction window and enter.
3. Type 
(place-image (rectangle 10 10 "solid" "red") 30 30 (circle 60 "outline" "black"))
into the interaction window and enter.

 Oh! Of course. Please see the "nitty gritty" section. (The short
 answer is that this is the intended behavior; the long version is that
 section.)
