[Distilled from actual errors Guillaume saw during his coding of student errors.]

Imagine you are programming for the first time, in BSL, perhaps taking math and econ classes at the same time.  It seems natural to write the number

  10,000

in your program.

In the definitions window (BSL),

  #lang htdp/bsl
  10,000

produces

Module Language: invalid module text
. read: illegal use of comma

which could possibly be improved a bit.  But in the REPL, it produces

> 10,000
10
. . reference to an identifier before its definition: unquote

which is certainly a violation of the Language Level Principle.
