 This is actually correct behavior. 
 
 The word ‘part’ should probably be replaced with ‘expression’ or perhaps ‘phrase’. In ISL, the function position must be a name, not an expression. If you raise the level to ISL+, the expression is evaluated just fine.

 Hmm, that's tricky. I was going to suggest then that it be removed from the
 list of functions in the ISL documentation since it's not really usable at
 that level. But it actually is useful as long as it's not in the function
 position, e.g. (map (compose ...) ...). Nonetheless, if I wanted to show a
 student how (compose ) works by itself, that isn't doable in ISL.

 (define f (compose g h))
 
 (f 10)
 
 works fine and is exactly what they expect from math. It came up in my lecture on Monday, too. (Which is why I immediately recognized the problem)
