 I can't reproduce this on the Mac. I am wondering whether this is a =
 Windows specific bug. Just to make sure, you are running this program:=20=
 
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 (require 2htdp/image)
 
 (define (create-rocket-scene height)
   (place-image (circle 3 'solid 'red) 50 height (empty-scene 100 100)))
 
 (animate create-rocket-scene)

 I managed to get the canvas window to freeze twice, and when I used Task =
 Manager to end the 'non responsive' program all of DrRacket was ended.
