>Description:
The documentation for universe says this about the on-msg hook:
;; ---
(on-msg msg-expr)
 
msg-expr: (-> UniverseState iworld? sexp? bundle?)
tell DrScheme to apply msg-expr to the current state of the universe, the world w that sent the message, and the message itself. Note that w is guaranteed to be on the list low.
;; ---
There is no list mentioned in the contract, so it appears the reference to "the list low" should be removed.
>How-To-Repeat:
See /doc/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#(form._((lib._2htdp/universe..ss)._on-msg))
