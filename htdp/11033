>Description:
When rendering a large (1200x700) empty scene, the window actually cycles between 1-2 seconds of black followed by several seconds of white, then black,...

It should show continuous white (with a black outline).

Problem seems to occur only in htdp/image and not in 2htdp/image as far as I can tell.
>How-To-Repeat:
On Windows, using the universe and (htdp) image teachpacks:

(define white (empty-scene 1200 700))
(define (render t)
  white)

(define (tick t)
  false)

(big-bang false
          (on-draw render)
          (on-tick tick 1))

------------------------

Once you can get this behavior happening, then it will also happen in the interactions window.  In other words,
when typing
white
repeatedly in the interactions window,
some percentage of the time it will show an enormous black rectangle, rather than a white rectangle with a black border.

However, if I just run a minimal version of the program with only the definition of white and no big-bang, the problem does not manifest.
