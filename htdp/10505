>Description:
This is hardly a critical issue since so many animations/games have tick handlers, but the initial state is not shown in the window created by specifying (state true) in a (big-bang ...) expression.

Since that's such a minor issue, I'll add a related feature suggestion too: how about a (state-history n) clause that retains the most recent n states in the state window, for 0 <= n <= [some reasonable constant]?
>How-To-Repeat:
(big-bang "foo" (state true))
