>Description:
Exercise 7.4.5 says to draw a circle, sleep a while, then undraw
it (roughly).  Unfortunately, SLEEP returns VOID, not a BOOLEAN,
so the standard way of composing drawing functions -- through AND
-- fails.  There is in fact no way (I know of) to work around this
without changing language levels.

The solutions unfortunately do not include one for this one
particular exercise, which is probably why we didn't notice
the problem earlier.

I suggest that SLEEP in the student levels return a BOOLEAN.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set Teachpack to draw.ss.  Run

(and (draw-...)
     (sleep 10)
     (draw-...))

 The teachpack should provide an appropriate `sleep', right?

 is provided via sleep-for-a-while in draw.ss (and other teachpacks).

 The problem here is that the Teachpack does provide one --
 SLEEP-FOR-A-WHILE -- but its name isn't listed in the text, nor does
 it show up when you search in Help Desk.

 it's in the docs for the teachpack and it's mentioned in the book, with
 specs. (i did a grep, running off to the office now)

 You're right, it's there -- I missed it.  Sorry.
 
 Nevertheless, it doesn't show up in the Help Desk, and it should.
