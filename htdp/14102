>Description:
The errors for contract voilations on the 'to-draw' clause of big-bang report the name 'on-draw.' A few students were confused by this, as the documentation hardly mentions 'on-draw' and most students have never seen it. Attached is a program that demonstrates the bad error message:

on-draw: expected function of one argument as first argument; given function of 2 arguments 
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

(define (broken-draw a b) (empty-scene 20 20))
(big-bang #f 
          [to-draw broken-draw])
