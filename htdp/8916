>Description:
When I define two functions f and g, I want the tests for f just below f and the tests for g just below g -- EVEN IF f refers to g and g is defined below f. At the moment, I don't get this behavior. 

(This is the only reason I asked for closures in check-expect.) 
>How-To-Repeat:
;; N -> N
(define (f x) (g (- x 1)))

(check-expect (f 10) 9)

;; N -> N
(define (g y) y)

(generate-report)

This fails with an error message concerning underfined g. 
[It would be okay to fail if generate-report were called 
too early, say above the definition of g.]
