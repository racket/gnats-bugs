>Description:
If I use the circle function (in image.ss) in a Mac install of DrRacket, copy and paste the result into a check-expect with the precise function call I used to generate it, it works perfectly... until I transfer the file to a PC, where the circle generated is slightly different, therefore failing the test.
>How-To-Repeat:
On Mac DrRacket, switch to a student language (e.g. BSL), load "image.ss", and type
  (circle 20 "solid" "red")
Copy the result and paste it into the line
  (check-expect (circle 20 "solid" "red") <img>)
replacing "<img>".  Run it---the test passes.

Save the .rkt file, transfer to a PC.  Open in Windows DrRacket, run it.  Test case fails.

 I'm sorry to say that that is an inherent limitation in htdp/image and
 one of the reasons we built 2htsp/image. Maybe give it a try instead?
 (let me know if you get stuck.)

 I *have* given it a try; I've so far avoided using 2htdp/image in my
 course because it's not available in the teachpacks.  Making them type a
 require at the top of each file seems like just another source of bugs.
 Even I have a hard time remembering the incantation (I keep thinking
 it's htdp2/image) so I'm really leery of throwing it at the students.
 (Although admittedly, it's beans compared to the hoops I had students
 jump through when I was in a Java-first curriculum....)
 
 If this is a known problem, have you thought about deprecating the
 image.ss teachpack?  Failfasting the check-expects for images (perhaps
 similar to how inexacts are handled)?  Inserting a warning in the text,
 which is still instructing people to use the teachpack version of the
 image library rather than the require?  Because I really didn't see this
 coming, the students were confused, and it didn't really send a very
 pro-testing message.

 I think you should give the require a try (next year maybe!). It has
 the advantage that it is more transparent: you can look at the file
 and see what is going on,without having to consult the state of the
 environment.
 
 But, in the next release, there will be two columns in the add
 teachpack dialog. Hopefully that'll help.

 Please consider it deprecated. (perhaps informally)

 Unfortunately, this has been the way it has worked for quite some time
 now and others have developed significant course materials around it.
 I don't want to make them change on my schedule, but instead on
 theirs. So we will continue to keep htdp/image working like it works
 (for some definition of the word works).
