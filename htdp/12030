>Description:
The following program raises an error:

#lang racket/base
(require 2htdp/image)
step-count?

The error is:

    compile: unbound identifier in module in: step-count?



However, the binding does show up if one does this in the definitions window:

    #lang racket/base
    (require 2htdp/image)

and then try this at the Interactions:

    step-count?

So something non-hygienic appears to be happening.

 JFYI, I've scanned some mailboxes that get all kind of errors and
 such, and in this PR Danny used "dyoo@cs.wpi.du" by mistake.  I've
 fixed the PR to use "edu" instead.

Reason>>> Appears not to apply in recent version of Racket.  Tested against 5.3.2.
