 ... in which a work-around is recommended: write a "provide.rkt" that simply says "(provide provide)", and require it anywhere that you want to provide something.
 
 The obvious question is, why hasn't "provide" been integrated into the teaching languages after all these years of people requesting it?
 
 And I guess the answer is that we haven't figured out how to properly cross language boundaries with it, because what BSL actually exports for defined functions is a macro that complains if the function name appears in non-function-call position.
 
 But all the common cases work.  If my students don't leave the student languages, they'll have no trouble.  The ONLY situation in which "provide" fails, as far as I can tell, is if you provide a function name from BSL or BSLLA, require it in a non-student language like racket or plai, and use it in non-function-call position.  In the unlikely event that my first-semester students are writing things in non-student languages, they're probably not relying on a lot of stuff written in BSL -- and if they are, they can go back and save it in ISL instead, and everything works.
 
 I'm sure there must be other situations in which this goes wrong, but are they common enough to prevent us from just putting "provide" into the student languages?
