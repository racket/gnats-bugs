>Description:
The error message given by string-ith is incorrect: the upper bound of the input range is too high.  If I type

> (string-ith "hello" 5)

in any of the Student Languages, the error message is:

string-ith: <exact integer in [0, length of the given string (5)]> for second argument expected, given 5

The upper bound of the range should either be non-inclusive (using a round bracket) or should be given as *one less than* the length of the given string.  Probably the latter, since many of the students have not seen square-vs-round-bracket notation for ranges yet.
>How-To-Repeat:
* Load Beginner Student Language
* type (string-ith "hello" 5)
