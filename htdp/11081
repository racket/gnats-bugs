>Description:
I was playing with the new 5.0.1 tonight, a simple universe program under bsl (running on my MacBook Pro, v10.6.4):

~~~snip~~~
(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

;; render: world -> image
(define (render w)
  (place-image (circle 50 "solid" "red") 
               100 w 
               (empty-scene 200 400))) 

(big-bang 1
          (on-tick add1)
          (to-draw render)) 
~~~snip~~~

When I run this program, I encountered an anomaly with its stop behavior. Here's what the doc says about big-bang:

"A big-bang expression returns the last world when the stop condition is satisfied (see below) or when the programmer clicks on the Stop button or closes the canvas."
 
It would seem the doc and the universe are not in harmony...

>How-To-Repeat:
Use cases:

1. Run, watch red ball fall, then close universe window by clicking on button in upper left corner of universe window. Here's some sample output from the interactions pane:

Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.0.1 [3m].
Language: Beginning Student.
144
> 

Other runs may produce other values for the final state of the world. So far, so good.

2. Run, watch red ball fall, then press the "Stop" button in DrRacket. Once again, sample output from the interactions pane, but not really sample, as will become clear:
Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.0.1 [3m].
Language: Beginning Student.
user break
> 

Other runs produce the same output, which is way this isn't a sample. There is also an effect: the universe window freezes the ball, but the universe window doesn't close. Moreover, I can't close it by clicking on the window's close window button in the upper left corner. It ignores my attempts to close, but will minimize if I click on that button.

The next time I run the program, the frozen universe window is replaced, and if I close it using case 1, all is well with the world, universe, and DrRacket. 

If I had to speculate about case 2, it seems the Stop button is suspending a thread, but not killing it, and leaving it in a state impervious to a user killing it interactively by closing the universe window.
