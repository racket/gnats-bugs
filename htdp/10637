>Description:
Because the HtDP languages generate the module for student programs as,

 `(,#'module ,module-name ,language-module 
             ,@(map (λ (x) 
                      `(require ,x))
                    teachpacks))

or

 `(module ,modname ,spec
    ,@(map (λ (x) `(require ,x))
           (lookup 'teachpacks table))
    ...)

(depending on whether you look at run-teaching-program.ss or htdp-reader.ss; not actually which does what)

If a teachpack provides a 'require form, then any teachpacks later in the list will be require'd with the new require form, which might not do the same thing as the normal HtDP require form. This makes the HtDP language sensitive to teachpack load order even for non-conflicting teachpacks, which is probably undesirable.

Suggestion: allow the HtDP require form to contain multiple entries, and require all teachpacks in a single require form.

Suggestion I like less: add a new require-teachpack form the the HtDP languages, make teachpack loading use it, and declare that teachpacks Should Not export a require-teachpack transformer.
>How-To-Repeat:
; Load the following teachpack, then any other:

#lang scheme
(provide require only-in except-in prefix-in rename-in combine-in)
