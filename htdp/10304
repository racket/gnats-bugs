(define/contract (fact n)

  (cond [(= n 7) true]
        [(<= n 0) 1]
        [else (* n (fact (- n 1)))]))

In Intermediate Student Language, this works as expected.  In Beginning Student (with or without list abbreviations), it doesn't pass a syntax check because it doesn't recognize the recursive call to "fact".
