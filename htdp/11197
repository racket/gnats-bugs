>Description:
A student sent me a program that I reduced to the following.  It appears to me that control should never have entered the move-world function: it should have halted at the boundary saying that the argument was not a world.  Instead, the error appears at (world-u w).  Control should never have gotten there!
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-struct world (u))
(: make-world (Number -> world))
(: world-u (world -> Number))

(: move-world (world -> world))
(define (move-world w)
  (world-u w))

(move-world (empty-scene 100 100))

>>

world-u: expects argument of type <struct:world>; given #(struct:object:image% ...)

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by sperber at Sun, 16 Jan 2011 09:59:46 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed a while ago by moving to eager (but memoized) signature 
checking in ASL.
