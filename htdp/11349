>Description:
If you use record? to generate images for a
world program that consists of a singleton
world state, you get:

car: expects argument of type <pair>; given empty

This happens in 5.0.1 and a recent build from git.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program in BSL.  Be careful to press
stop WITHOUT moving the mouse over the scene
(which would have the effect of generating new
world states).  Press Images and select a location
to save the files.

(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

(define (draw-number n)
  (place-image (text (number->string n) 44 'red)
               50 50
               (empty-scene 100 100)))

(big-bang 0
          (on-draw draw-number)
          (record? true))

 This bug is related to http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=11358
 
 write-animated-gif gives a (car '()) error when given the empty list.
 
 However, there seems to be another bug in the universe code, since a 
 world program that consists of a singleton world state should render a 
 single animation frame to the animated gif file.
 
 Looking at collects/2htdp/private/world.rkt, it looks like the bmps list 
 is empty when no events happen, which then triggers the 
 write-animated-gif bug.

 It does: Closes PR11348 and PR11349=20
 
 Should the word "Closes" be repeated?=20

 Yes, it's a very simple regexp -- roughly speaking, it looks for
 occurrences of "closes pr *[0-9]*" (or "fixes", and a few others).
