>Description:
If the third arg to check-within is negative, the error message is about `equal~?` rather than `check-within`.  Might be confusing for beginners?
>How-To-Repeat:
(require test-engine/racket-tests)
(check-within 5 20 -1)
(test)
#|
check-expect encountered the following error instead of the expected value, 25. 
   :: equal~?: third argument must be of type <non-negative-real>, given 25, 4, and -1
