>Description:
bitmap/url does not seem to handle transparency correctly, for images which are handled correctly by bitmap/file and the "Insert Image" menu item.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; In DrRacket, I observed the bug using this code:
(require 2htdp/image)

(bitmap/url "http://jjohnson.kirby.org/prog1/img/red-balloon.png")
;; The background of the image (in Interactions) should be white and is not.

;; Contrast with downloading the image and inserting
;; via the Insert menu, or using bitmap/file.
