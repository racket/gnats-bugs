>Description:
The record functionality breaks when the
on-tick function is effectful -- it fails
to record the effects generated when played,
and instead re-computes when generating 
images.

For example, if the on-tick function generates
random numbers, the numbers seen during play
don't match the numbers seen when generating
images.

This bug shows up in 5.0.1; using a more
recent build from git, this bug is hidden by
bug 11348.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program in BSL (5.0.1).  Write down 
the first few numbers you see.  Press Stop,
then Images, then examine the generated images.
They (with high likelihood) will not match.

(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

(define (draw-number n)
  (place-image (text (number->string n) 44 'red)
               50 50
               (empty-scene 100 100)))

(define (tock _)
  (random 100))

(big-bang 0
          (on-tick tock 1)
          (on-draw draw-number)
          (record? true))
