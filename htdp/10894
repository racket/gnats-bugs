>Description:
The advanced student language (as well as: Intermediate Student with lambda, and Intermediate Student) allows use of + as a first-class entity (e.g., as an argument to foldr) but does not for or.

In particular, using or as such produces the error "or: found a use of `or' that does not follow an open parenthesis".

I assume that many other built-in functions behave similarly (e.g., "and").

 or and and aren't functions.=20
 
 Consider=20
 
   (and (not (=3D x 0))
        (> (+ (/ 1 x) epsilon) .01))
 
 You don't want a computation to fault when x =3D 0, which it would if =
 and were a function.=20
 
 For more info, see the docs (via F1).=20

State changed from "open" to "closed" by matthias at Wed, 05 May 2010 08:37:28 -0400
Reason>>> not a bug, though we may wish to consider adding && and || as analogous 
functions.
