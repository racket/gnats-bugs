big-bang clause: (state ...)

This state display window is a wonderful feature!  My initial experiences with it, however, are that it does not render the initial state.

I realize that the documentation mentions that the world state is rendered upon update, but it would be nice if the initial world state was also shown.
>How-To-Repeat:
;WorldState is a string

;tick-handler: WorldState -> WorldState
;purpose: indicate that a tick has occurred
(define (tick-handler ws) "TICK!")

;render: WorldState -> Scene
;purpose: make an empty scene so the world can be stopped nicely
(define (render ws) (empty-scene 100 100))

; The state display window is blank until the first clock tick event
; Closing the world prior to the first clock tick event confirms the initial world state is not an empty string
(big-bang "Nothing happened yet..." (on-tick tick-handler 3) (on-draw render) (state true))
