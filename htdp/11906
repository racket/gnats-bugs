>Description:
If I create a large image (e.g. circle, square) via 2htdp/image, the code fails with one of two error messages (depending on just how large).  If it is moderately large (e.g. a circle of radius 10000) there is an extremely long pause and then the error message

make-bytes: out of memory making byte string of length 1600160004

If it is extremely large (e.g. a circle of radius 30000), it immediately fails with the error message

bytes-fill!: expects type <mutable byte string> as 1st argument, given: false; other arguments were: 0

Both of these are bugs in two different ways: if it's supposed to fail, it's a bad error message, and it's not supposed to fail.  This is a regression from 5.0.2, where making circles of absurd size works instantly and correctly.

I'll add, in case it's helpful, that in version 5.1 both of the above situations failed in an even worse way: the system hung, popped up a dialog labelled "DrRacket Internal Error" with a partial call stack dump, and then the system became totally unresponsive and needed to be killed.  I mention this in part because I thought the stack dumps might be useful.  For the medium-size problem (make-bytes), I got the following error and stack dump:

make-bytes: out of memory making byte string of length 1600480036

and for the larger-number problem (bytes-fill!) I got this:

>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket v{5.0.2,5.1,5.1.1} and type

(require 2htdp/image)
(circle 10000 "solid" "red")

and click Run.  On v5.0.2 it works, on 5.1 it crashes the entire DrRacket instance, and on 5.1.1 it gives an error.

Replace the 10000 with 30000 and click Run.

On v5.0.2 it works, on 5.1 it crashes the entire DrRacket instance, and on 5.1.1 it gives an error.

switch it back to me if you want a smaller program
