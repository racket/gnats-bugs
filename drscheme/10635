>Description:
The procedure bitmap->bytes in mrlib/private/image-core-bitmap.ss has a mask argument, in order that a caller can override the bitmap's loaded mask.  But this arg is then ignored and the loaded mask used anyhow.  That causes a problem for the rotate operation in 2htdp/image (as well as for scaling by <1), when applied to an image-snip that has a mask within the image-snip but not within the underlying bitmap.  The code in 2htdp/image and mrlib/image-core.ss properly passes along the image-snip's mask, all the way up through do-rotate in mrlib/image-core.ss passing it in as an argument to bitmap->bytes -- at which point it vanishes.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/gui
(require 2htdp/image)

(define bmp (make-object bitmap% 40 40))
(define mask (make-object bitmap% 40 40))
(define bdc (make-object bitmap-dc% bmp))
(send bdc set-brush "orange" 'solid)
(send bdc draw-rectangle 0 0 40 40)
(send bdc set-bitmap mask)
(send bdc set-brush "black" 'solid)
(send bdc clear)
(send bdc draw-rectangle 10 10 10 10)
(send bdc set-bitmap #f)
(rotate 45 (make-object image-snip% bmp mask))
>Fix:
the bitmap->bytes function should have been using the 'mask' argument, not the loaded-mask from the bmp argument.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract error nor was it a type error. both values have the right type, but only one is the right value.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 01 Dec 2009 23:45:04 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released in SVN.

Thanks for the report!
