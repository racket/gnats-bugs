>Description:
The current behavior of the file dialog makes it just
about impossible to save a file with a different
extension than one of the standards. See steps, below:
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new file. Type a few chars. Choose "save file".
type foo.abc (notice that "hide extension" box is
checked). Save file... whoops! It has a "." at the end. 

Second try: Perhaps you should have unchecked that "hide
extension" box. Now a dot appears at the end of the 
filename.  Now, delete the dot.  Wait... the box is 
checked again! Leave drscheme, rename file manually.

 This bug is in fact specific to drocaml.  I conjecture that drocaml is  
 using a "too-strict" setting for the set of allowable file suffixes.

 *sigh*... no, my mistake.  It is not specific to ocaml.  I'm still  
 having this problem in the 'module' language level.
