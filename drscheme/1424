 Sadly, DrScheme uses a pretty-printer that produces output that never 
 wraps. So, the best thing it can do in your case is to put each 
 element of the list on a single line. You might want to consider 
 using `write', eg:
 
 (write (list 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'A 'B 'A 'A 'B 'B 'A 'A 'B 
 'B 'A 'A 'B 'B 'A 'A 'A 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 'C 'B 'A 'A 'B 
 'C 'C 'B 'A 'A 'A 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 'D 'C 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 
 'D 'D 'C 'B 'A 'A 'A 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 'B 'A 'A 'B 'C 'D 'C 'B 'A 'A 'B 
 'C 'D 'E 'D 'C 'B 'A))
 
 Hope that helps,

 Well, you bring up an interesting point.  On the other hand, consider 
 things like:
 
 '(define result
     (my-procedure
      (first-arg-proc first-arg-args)
      (second-arg-proc second-arg-args)
      (third-arg-proc third-arg-args)
      (fourth-arg-proc fourth-arg-args)))
 
 (this is in full scheme, BTW.) The question is whether you'd rather 
 have this displayed as:
 
 (define result
    (my-procedure
      (first-arg-proc first-arg-args)
      (second-arg-proc second-arg-args)
      (third-arg-proc third-arg-args)
      (fourth-arg-proc fourth-arg-args)))
 
 or as
 
 (define result (my-procedure (first-arg-proc first-arg-args) 
 (second-arg-proc second-arg-args) (third-arg-proc third-arg-args) 
 (fourth-arg-proc fourth-arg-args)))
 
 In my opinion, the first one is a lot easier to read.  The second 
 one, however, seems to be the one that you're espousing.  So how do 
 you decide which wrapping style to use for a given list?

 I didn't understand the response by John Clements (it was over my head) but 
 doing (write (list blah)) isn't a great option since this big long list is 
 actually the return output from a "toy" problem I'm doing for my AI class.
 
 actually I suppose I could call it using the write command around it but 
 that looks really messy.
 
 And what's wrong with just letting it scroll past the end of the 
 screen?  Doesn't the output window have it's own word wrap?  is it for 
 compatability with something else?

 It is kind of compatibility with something else. DrScheme uses 
 something called a "pretty printer" to format output for the repl. 
 This works really well when using sexpressions to represent programs. 
 For example, you might use the expression:
 
    (cons 'lambda (cons 'x null) 'x)
 
 to represent the syntax for the identity function. That seems pretty 
 strange, until you realize that there is a shorthand for that 
 expression, namely:
 
    '(lambda (x) x)
 
 So, the printer is optimized for printing out those kinds of things.
 
 The best I can offer for right now is to wrap your entire program in 
 a "write" to get the output.
 
 I will bring this up at the next PLT meeting; maybe we will add a 
 knob to the language configuration dialog so that values are no 
 longer printed using the pretty printer, insead, drscheme will just 
 use write internally to print things out. If we did that, would you 
 be happy?

State-Changed-Why:

I have added an option to the language configuration dialog that prints
output all on a single line and lets the word wrapping mechanism decide how 
to wrap it, insteead of using the pretty printer. Look for that in version
102.

Thanks for the report!
