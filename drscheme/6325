>Description:
In the interactions window, I can enter the expression:
(begin (require (lib "list.ss")) (+ 1 2))
and recieve the expected answer of 3
If I put this into a Test Suite call, I get an error message:
#<struct:object:call-text%>:1:7: require: not at top-level or in module body in: (require (lib "list.ss")) in: (require (lib "list.ss"))
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new test suite, add the call
(begin (require (lib "list.ss")) (+ 1 2))
Hit execute, see the error
>Fix:
the test suite was first expanding and then eval'ling the expressions,
but this isn't right. It needs to flatten out top-level begins. Now,
it doesn't expand, but just calls eval (which already does this
flattening)

 The problem here is that the contents of the boxes are not evaluated at
 the toplevel (there is code wrapped around them and that whole thing is
 passed to eval). We discussed this a little bit when you were here --
 and didn't conclude what should be done. But, since profj seems to rely
 on the expressoins in the test cases boxes being evaluated at the
 toplevel (a reasonable requirement) it should be supported.
 
 I think that this can be fixed by multiple calls to `eval-syntax' in
 the definition on `execute' in
 plt/collects/test-suite/private/expand-program.ss. 
 
 There is something that has to be added to support IO and handle this,
 but if you get it working first without IO, we can talk about how to go
 from there.
