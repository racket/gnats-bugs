>Description:
DrScheme is a *text* editor, yet it's on a small and impolite group
of text editors that will not terminate a file with a newline.  That
makes for small annoyances when dealing with other tools.  (And yes,
you can claim that as long as drscheme is used there is no problem,
but I  still think that it should do the newlines thing -- at least 
until we have tools like grep, diff, and a subversion client...)

 FWIW, Emacs is also in this small and impolite group.

 No -- it always had a `require-final-newline' that was a popular
 things to customize, and in some version they made many textual modes
 set it to `t'.

 My emacs defaults to the no-mandatory-final-newline mode when I open a
 Scheme file. I don't think I customized it.
 
 I guess this is something I should add to DrScheme, rather than
 something to be added at the mred level?

 Do you have version 22?

 That's what I think -- there might be cases at the mred level when you
 don't want that (just like the emacs variable being a customization
 option).

 22.0.50.1, apparently.

 Oh yeah, looks like scheme-mode is not updated.  (Not surprising, it's
 a bunch of mess that nobody maintains, I think.)  Open a .txt file to
 see it happen.  But even in scheme-mode or whatever, it's something
 that people often set in their .emacs.
