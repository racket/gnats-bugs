 I guess you don't have an american keyboard? I can't seem to get cmd-<
 and cmd-> to do anything (other than insert . and , into the text
 (their unshifted versions)).
 
 On my computer, cmd-~ rotates between windows, but in a
 most-recently-used fashion, not in a cycle.

 Right.  < is unshifted, > is.  Both work, but with the mentioned

 Where are these keyboard shortcuts coming from? They don't seem to be a
 standard apple list.

 Hm, I think I saw them in some "Mac OS X for power users" type book a
 long time ago.
