pr 9988

When you put an inline image 
into a semi-colon comment, the 
auto-indentation is lined up with
the left side of the image in the 
comment, which is usually not the
appropriate indentation.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Get an image snip on the clipboard.

2. Type:
; some comment text

3. Paste the snip after "text" above and hit enter.

4. Note that that cursor is not at the 
appropriate indentation point.  

5. Also note that after fixing the cursor,
hitting tab returns to the bad spot.

Reason>>> I fixed this one a few weeks ago, I think. It is a duplicate
of some other PR, but I forget the PR number.
