>Description:
I just downloaded and installed DrScheme version 200. 
Whenever I start it up it tries to do something with my 
floppy (read/initialize/?) causing it to make this 
annoying noise (since there is no floppy in the drive it
sounds like it does a number of rapid retries.

 This is caused by a call to `filesystem-root-list' to get the default
 value of the 'drscheme:multi-file-search:directory preference.
 
 Maybe the default could be computed only when necessary?

 I just made the default be the empty string.

 Now that it's gone, I almost miss the mechanical click of a freshly
 started DrScheme. :)
