>Description:
Every so often, I'll tell DrRacket to run what I've written, and the interactions area will become completely clear. It doesn't even give the normal message (Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.2 [3m]. Language: Beginning Student; memory limit: 128 MB.). The program still highlights parts of what I've written; it just doesn't tell me what the problems are, or whether my tests have passed, etc.

I've gotten around it easily enough by opening a new file and copy-pasting everything in.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know what it is that's causing it - I only know that it seems to happen after I hit Ctrl-R to run my program.
