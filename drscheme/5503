 This is a problem with helpwin.ss, which is using `ok/cancel-buttons'
 from guiutil.ss. It binds the first return value to `ok' and the second
 to `cancel'. Disabling `ok' actually disables "Cancel", at least in
 Unix.
 
 The problem is that it looks like there's no consistent order for the
 return values. The documentation says nothing about the order.
 
 [Side note: In the documentation, use the {\MacOSX}, {\MacOSX}, and
 {\MacOSBoth} macros to name Mac OS. That way we get a consistent space
 between "Mac" and "OS".]

 After grepping for uses of ok/cancel-buttons, it seems clear that the
 cancel button should be second in the return order. I've comitted and
 exp-tagged a new gui-utils.ss (but didn't try to fix the docs).

 Thanks, Matthew.
 
 I've committed a fix to the docs.
 
 Did you find the docs hard to fix? They are right there in the front of
 the file you fixed. (I'm working my way to a better docs specification,
 by trying out things -- I'm not yet happy with it, but I like the idea
 of putting the docs in the provide specs, along with the contract). The
 only annoying thing is that you have to escape the LaTeX backslashes.

 I didn't try, because I didn't have time to run the doc build to make
 sure it would still be ok.
