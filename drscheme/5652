>Description:
If you fire up drscheme from the command line, and give it as an argument the
name of a non-existent file, it pops up an error dialog complaining that the
file doesn't exist.  I think it should either:

(a) open up a blank file with that name (consistent with how all other text
editors interpret command line args), or

(b) pop up a dialog giving you the choice to open as a blank file (as long as
you're popping up a dialog, why not?)
