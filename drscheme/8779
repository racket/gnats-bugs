>Description:
The autosave reliably fails on the second autosave to a given file. Cf. Steps to reproduce
>How-To-Repeat:
In Beginner:
Open a new file.  Type some characters.  save it. type some more characters
... (wait for autosave interval) ...
check file system, see that there's an autosave file there.  Notice that the
"save" box is now gone from the window (not sure whether this is a bug or 
not, but possibly related).
Type some more characters.
... (wait for autosave interval) ...
Voila! Error box stating: ... oh heck, I don't have it now.  And it takes 2x 
autosave interval to generate it.  I'll attach it separately.
>Fix:
The bug was that the modified flag wasn't being set properly when the metadata was removed from the editor (for the special teaching languages saving stuff).

The modified flag was always set to #f, but it should have been set to whatever it was before removing the metadata.

I don't know why that fix also fixed the other symptom John saw, but it did.

>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation (but thru some strange callbacks that I don't understand).
