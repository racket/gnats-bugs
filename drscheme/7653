Reading from current-input-port is slow (about 30 characters/second on my system), much slower than reading from other ports, and much slower than the reader used by the default read-eval-print loop.

The problem seems to be the feature that highlights the input text character by character.  Evidently Dr. Scheme busy-waits while that is done.  

Is there a workaround?

>How-To-Repeat:
1. In the Dr. Scheme listenter, enter (read). An input box appears.
2. Paste the problem description, above, including delimiting double-quotes, into the input box.
3. Enter <CR>, and count seconds.
