 Is the issue that there was a space in there, or is the issue that
 DrRacket doesn't recognize the control-\ key binding?
 
 Thanks,

 When I put my keyboard in french mode, I see that the \ is a shifted
 character (down in the bottom right of the keyboard). That's what you
 have, right?
 
 From what I can tell, it is not possible to type control-\ on a French
 keyboard. The OS decides that when you hold down the control key that
 the \ is really a : key (the unshifted version of it).
 
 I see this by turning on the floating keyboard by opening up the
 'system preferences' (under the apple menu) and then choosing the
 keyboard section of that. There, I get two check boxes, the lower one,
 when checked, enables a menu in the international menu (the place
 where you can switch keyboard layouts in the menu bar) that opens up a
 virtual keyboard so you can see what keys the OS is going to send to
 the application when you push various modifiers.
 
 So ... maybe we need another keybinding for this? control-: maybe?
 
 David: if you open the file plt/collects/framework/private/keymap.rkt
 and find these two lines:
 
           (map "~m:c:\\" "TeX compress")
           (map "~c:m:\\" "TeX compress")
 
 
 and add this one:
 
           (map "~m:c:colon" "TeX compress")
 
 and then restart DrRacket, does the keybinding then begin to work?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Hi,
 
 Thanks for your precious advices.
 The proposed sequence : ~m:c:colon did not work for the same reason
 you evoked. The use of the virtual keyboard has helped me to
 understand. A simpler sequence like c:x;l  did.
 
 Thanks a lot.
