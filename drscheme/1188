I am getting the following message at startup:

compound-unit/sig: 6th linkage (print-convert signature) for basis is missing a value name "booleans-as-true/false", required by basis unit's 6th import (mzlib:print-convert signature)
>How-To-Repeat:
This is a totally virgin installation.  I downloaded DrScheme 100, installed it, browsed around in Help Desk, downloaded and installed the patch file and then tried to start DrScheme.  MrEd and MzScheme start ok.

 You almost certainly need to run setup-plt in 'clean' mode.  For more
 instructions, follow the instructions given in bold red text on the patch
 page:
 
 <http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/patches.shtml>
 
 Let me know if this does not solve the problem.

 After installing the patch, be sure to run Setup PLT with the --clean flag. See the patch web page:
 
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/patches.shtml
 
 for details.
