 Under windows, can't you do something like alt, f, up, up, up or
 something close to that?

 Yes, one could do "alt-f, up, up, up, up, enter" ... that's a little
 tedious, but yes, better than having to switch to mouse ...
 
 I noticed that ctl-shift-f is taken for replace (within file) - so that
 wouldn't work ...
 
 how about having one of the 'f''s in the 'find in files ...' menu item
 receive the shortcut/underline treatment so that both "alt-f, f, enter" and
 "alt-f, alt-f" would work ...
 
 Actually, it looks like none of the items in the menus show the underline
 in the menu item text, but the shortcut key seems to work ...

 Okay, I've made the _F_ in "Search in Files" get the underline in the menu.
 
 Thanks for the report.
