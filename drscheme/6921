>Description:
When I use #; the indentation is with respect to the following
sexpression, but that sexpression is indented two charecters from
the "#;" This means the things bellow a #; are misaligned.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; Use meta-I on this program and you'll get ugly code

>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sowens" by eli at Wed, 14 Jul 2004 14:16:14 -0400
Reason>>> indentation

Responsible changed from "sowens" to "mflatt" by sowens at Sat, 17 Jul 2004 10:21:29 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew recently worked on the indenter some.  Perhaps it is his 
responsibility?


State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 18:56:51 -0500
