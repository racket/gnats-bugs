I would like for it to work such that when you middle click an editor-tab header, that tab would close. This is easier than going to the file-menu when your hands aren't on the keyboard, or ctrl:w, for example.

 Personally, I've been agitating for a little "x" on there like you see
 in other applications. :)

 I was about to object to anything that has no precedence in common
 applications, but I see now that both IE and FireFox (the latter on
 Linux) do the middle-button thing.
 
 (But the `x' would be nice to have too.  (One thing that annoys me in
 IE is that the `x' is not shown in inactive tabs or in the active tab
 if it's the only one -- so the middle-click trick is good to know.))
