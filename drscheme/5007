>Description:
the keybindings in the language dialog are funny. 

From Matthew:
>  * The arrow keys don't seem to work right in the language-selection
>    list. For example:
> 
>      * Select "module" and type an up arrow (weird)
>      * Select "Beginner", type left arrow, then type up arrow (internal error)
