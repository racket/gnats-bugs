 I've added the .plt.  Please see if this fixes the bug.

 This is now your responsibility... let me know if you get to a point where
 I need to do something.

>Unformatted:

I have added the manual to the list that Help Desk knows about, but
match-doc.plt is not in the right place and the web page is not updated.

I committed and exptagged the relevant file in the help collection, but I
have not released it to ~scheme.
