>Description:
If I save a file, then make changes that I don't save, and run the program, DrScheme runs the version on disk instead of the one in the window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following two line program to file from DrScheme:

#lang scheme
5

In the Definitions Window, change the 5 to a 4, but do not save it.  Run the program.  The output is "5".
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt at Mon, 12 Apr 2010 19:30:42 -0400
Reason>>> related to my changes

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 12 Apr 2010 19:30:42 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. DrScheme constructed a resolved module path
with an ".ss" extension, but the resolved path should have
a ".rkt" extension; used `module-path-index-resolve', so
that the right extension is automatic.
