>Description:
At least on the Macintosh, it is common usage that applications do
quit automatically when the last document window is closed. 

Here's why: I often close a project and open another one afterwards.
DrScheme forces me to leave the first window open, open the other 
file, and only afterwards closing the first one (requires switching windows).
