>Description:
Since the past two weeks, I have been having problems with the "=" character in Dr. Racket 5.0.1. It works fine most of the time, but there are times when I hit "=", the "-" character shows up in the Racket editor. To work around this, I tried copying the character off the internet, copying it from the Character Map in Windows and also using the Unicode Format for the character. Other characters like lambda work fine when the unicode is used.

Moreover, when I try using the same "=" character in Word, Textedit or any other application for that matter, it seems to work fine. I assume it's some bug in Dr. Racket or maybe one of the builds ?

Note: I update the build quite frequently. Right now my only workaround is to unmount the image and load it all over again. 

I know it's not a huge problem, but it really is quite annoying when I want to use that rare "=" for predicates.

Regards,
Eric.

 Hi Eric: are you still seeing this problem with more recent versions
 of Racket? It would be helpful to us if you could give a try to the
 current pre-release version, available here:
 
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
