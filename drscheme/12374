>Description:
If you turn on syntactic test suite coverage and run a program
with partial coverage, you cannot auto-indent until some other
change to the file is made first.
>How-To-Repeat:
Turn on syntactic test suite coverage.
Run this in DrRacket (as indented):

#lang racket
(define (f x)
1)

Reindent All has no effect.
