>Description:
errortrace's hooks seem to be elided by the drscheme repl and vice-versa.

>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this code:

  (require-library "errortrace.ss" "errortrace")
  (car)

In debugless mzscheme, this does not print out the contexts.

In debug mzscheme, the error is not highlighted.

 One problem is that the current-eval parameter is being ignored by
 drscheme. This code:
 
   (current-eval 
    (let ([pe (current-eval)])
      (lambda (x) (pe `(+ ,x 1)))))
 
   2
 
 prints out 2, not 3.
