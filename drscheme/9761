>Description:
An image is a structure that holds a graphic to render on screen as well as a pinhole that is used for overlay logic.

Right now the equal? predicate only seems to look at the graphic, not the pinhole.  This leads to oddness like the snippet of code that I put into the "Steps to Reproduce"

An argument that I can anticipate for not making the pinhole part of the equality predicate is that the pinhole is not readily apparent on screen as part of the snip that DrScheme renders.  *But* the appropriate fix here is to make DrScheme capable of showing the pinhole, not to hobble the behavior of the equal predicate.  

(To avoid interfering with the image content itself, the pinhole could be indicated via cross-hairs *outside* the border of the image; these cross-hairs could be perhaps toggled via a Preference Pane option, and/or perhaps as something one selects via the right-mouse-click context menu for an image snip.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1 [3m].
Language: Beginning Student custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
Teachpack: world.ss.
> (define a (circle 5 'solid 'green))
> (define b (move-pinhole a 5 5))
> (equal? a b)
true
> (equal? (pinhole-x a) (pinhole-y b))
false
>Fix:
the bug was the obvious thing: pinholes just weren't considered.
>Release-Note:
not a type error, not a contract violation.

 In case it isn't obvious, the final expression in Steps to Repeat  
 should have been:
 
    (equal? (pinhole-x a) (pinhole-x b))
 
 I erroneously typed the wrong selector in my haste.
 
 The point of the bug report remains unchanged.
