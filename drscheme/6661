>Description:
pressing <ctrl>-i in the Definitions window under OS X gives the following
internal error reliably on my machine:

send: target is not an object: #f for method: has-focus?
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme.  Press <ctrl>-i in, say, the interactions window.
>Fix:
the bug: the control-i keystroke was supposed to move the focus
to the docked version of the search window. But, if that window has
 never been opened (which, for most poeple is always the case) the
window is #f rather than the window (if that makes sense). This key
stroke should have been testing that condition before trying to move
the focus.
>Release-Note:
this was a contract violation.

 Where do you type the control-c? In the terminal window? In DrScheme
 itself, control-c doesn't do anything, but two control-c's runs check
 syntax.

 Right, right... I had forgotten that DrScheme still suffers from the 
 bug that control keys are not dvorak remapped. What I meant was:  
 <ctrl>-I always gives internal error.  I will change the title of the 
 PR.
 
 thanks,

 Matthew, did you know about the control-keys-dvorak thing?

 FWIW, this is PR 5489.  I'm sorry to report that it does not have the 
 word 'dvorak' in the PR title.
