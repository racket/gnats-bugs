>Description:
I don't know if this is a bug or a feature request, but right now, the "Collapse s-expression" item on the right-click menu doesn't work in the interactions window.  Selecting it (when point is immediately before an open paren) has no effect.  It doesn't seem to matter whether the sexpr in question is one that I typed at the prompt or one that the REPL printed.

The "collapse s-expr" command works fine in the definitions window.

It would be really nice if this option were available in the interactions window as well.  Often when I'm noodling around at the prompt to try to figure out why my code is failing, I'll evaluate a term that produces a huge s-expression, and it would be nice to hide that once I've visually inspected it.  So I'm most interested in having this work on the REPL's output (i.e., the printed representation of the value of the expression, not the output of format), but it would be nice to have it work on the stuff I type at the prompt as well.

As a last resort, the menu item shouldn't appear in the interactions window if it doesn't do anything.  But I'd *REALLY* prefer that it actually work.
