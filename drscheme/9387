>Description:
When you select "View|Module Browser" and the program in the
definitions window is not a module (or if it has any syntax
error), the DrScheme window/tab for that file does not allow
running or syntax checking.

Clicking the "Stop" button does work, but it's not obvious that
a user shold have to click it.

If you arrange for expansion to take a long time, such as with

 (begin-for-syntax
  (let loop () (loop)))

then clicking Stop lets you get back evaluation, but the module
browser is wedged. (To get it in a weird state, it may help to
switch tabs after breaking and before killing.)

Then you can do things like hide and show the module browser to
arrive at the error

 begin-adding-connections: already in begin-adding-connections/end-adding-connections sequence

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The module browser setup wasn't properly noticing that the compilation of the definitions window had failed and so was just waiting forever.

Specifically, the eventspace main thread would have an exception raised which would abort the compilation and
but the eventspace's main thread would not die -- instead
it would just wait for the next event (that thread dying
is what triggers the module browser code to stop waiting).

If that trigger didn't happne, strange things did happen eventually, as above.
>Release-Note:
This eventually triggered a contract violation. There was no type error.

 This still isn't completely working for me.
 
 If I start DrScheme in the Module language, leave the definitions
 window blank, and then select "Show Module Browser" from the "View"
 menu, then the "View" menu stays highlighted and the "Module Broswer:
 compiling definitions" label stays. Hiding and showing the browser
 gives me the same error reported in the PR (about
 `begin-adding-connections'). I can also edit the buffer during that
 time.
 
 The same thing happens if I have "#lang scheme .", or any other syntax
 error.
 
 Clicking "Stop" does behave better, though.

 Ugh. That's actually a read error, which I hadn't tested (syntax
 errors work fine).
 
 Anyways, read errors should now be working.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
