 I’m guessing that the Tab key is working as intended, but not as you expected.
 
 In DrRacket, pressing “Tab” alters the indentation of the current line to be “correct” with respect to earlier lines.
 
 So, for instance: 
 
 1) start with a fresh buffer
 2) Type 
 
 (define f
 
 3) Hit return. (See how the cursor is auto-indented?)
 4) hit Delete two times to move to the left, then type 234.
 5) Now hit tab. you should see the line that you’re on become indented correctly.
 
 Apologies if I’m misunderstanding your bug report; if so, please describe in more detail what you did, and what you expected to happen.
