>Description:
I created a fairly elaborate XML box (syllabus for 
210 in the fall), saved it and restarted DrScheme. 
Then I ran check syntax on the program, but it diverged. 
I had fortunately saved the file before I ran CS or so 
I thought. Then I restarted DrScheme to produce a bug 
report on the check syntax problem, and low and behold, 
the XML boxes (there were several them) disappeared. That is, 
the two XML boxes in the program and the two or three XML
boxes in the comment (embedded in a text box), had just 
gone away. 

As you can see, I have changed severity and priority in the 
radio boxes .. something I have not done in recent memory.

 I'm sorry you lost your work! That's terrible.
 
 I'm having trouble reproducing the problem. Here's what I tried:
 
   - start new drscheme
   - create XML box with "abcdef" in it
   - save file
   - quit drscheme
   - startup drscheme with file.
 
 When I do that, it seems to be there.
 
 If that works for you, can you think of anything else that you might
 have done that might change things?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Have you tried Check Syntax? I am still running 18 at home, because
 19 doesn't work on campus. It all happend when check syntax diverged
 on me and I had to kill DrScheme.

 That file opens fine for me with several XML boxes in it.

 Check syntax, too? DrScheme3m?

 I thought the problem was that you opened the file and lost your work?
 That what I was looking for. 
 
 I think that the problem might be that your installation at home isn't
 up to date. Some older versions of drscheme might not be able to load
 the XML boxes.
 
 As far as check syntax goes, it works fine for me. I can't run 3m on my
 computer.
 
 Please let me know if, after you update, you still cannot open the
 file.

 Okay there is a huge misunderstanding. 
 
 The whole thing happend on CCS. It has nothing to do with my plt tree
 at home. 
 
 To repeat, the scenario went like that: 
 
 "start here": 
  start drscheme3m on my 1100.ss file 
  work on it for quite a while 
  save 
  check synatx 
  .. ouch it diverges and doesn't respond to anything ... 
  I figure it's possibly just working hard, so I let it go for 10 mins ... 
  then I kill drscheme3m 
  I open 1100.ss (which i knew i had saved) and OUCH I realize that 
  all the XML boxes are gone -- just gone. 
 
 Fortunately, I had at least a backup file from "start here". 
 
 I was too afraid to repeat it all because I didn't want to spend
 the time and lose the file.
