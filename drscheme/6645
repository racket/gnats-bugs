>Description:
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I'm surprised by
the result.

The code below seems like it should produce an error that
+ is not defined. Instead, it says that + is used before
its definition:

  reference to an identifier before its definition: +

>How-To-Repeat:
(module lang mzscheme (provide (all-from-except mzscheme +)))
(module m lang)
(require m)
(parameterize ([current-namespace (module->namespace 'm)])
  (eval '+))

 There's nothing special about "+". The "used before its definition"
 message is just the way "undefined" is reported for module contexts.

  reference to an identifier before its definition: x in module: m
 
 I notice something strange in DrScheme. If I open a new DrScheme window
 as Beginner, then the error message for "x" is "undefined". If I hit
 execute and then try "x" again, the error message is "used before
 definition". Is the initial setup for the REPL different from an empty
 execute?

 Ugh. That's a bug, but probably a minor one (at least v206 wise).

 Yes, it is different, and I think that it must be, to support the
 module language. In the module language, clicking execute on an empty
 window is a runtime error.
