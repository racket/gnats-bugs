>Description:
If I choose File|Install .plt file, select Web, and 
use a (bad) file:// URL, I get the message

  There are no impure file: ports

But what does that mean?

Perhaps this is a moral statement? :-)

On this topic, Ulf Martin suggests that the Web/File distinction made is perhaps unclear:

>  remark no. 3
>  the "install .plt file" has two tabs: file and url.
>  both ask you for a line of text specifying the place of the .plt.  
> however, it obviously does not work to install from file using url 
> (e.g.  "file:// ...").
>  on the other hand, "file" doesn't open this typical "file chooser
> window".
>  i think, though, this would be the more sensible differentiation:
>  either plain text line (http:// or file:// never mind) or chooser
> window.

I don't know that I agree, though ...
