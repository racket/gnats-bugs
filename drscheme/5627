>Description:
I don't much care for the "comment"/"uncomment"
menu entries.  It would be so much nicer if we could
stuff the selected text in a box, which DrScheme
then knows to treat as a comment.  Then uncommenting
doesn't need to putz with deleting semi-colons, and
users can maybe collapse a comment box also.

 There are no "comment boxes" at the moment, and I think that the
 toughest part of this request is figuring out how to make comment boxes
 that look different from the other boxes in a clear, suggestive way.
 
 I guess we could get rid of the old "text" boxes, by changing their
 meaning.
