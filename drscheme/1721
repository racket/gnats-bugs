Site-wide defaults don't work.  The mechanism in collects/framework/prefs.ss

transfers them to PREFERENCES.

Now, I did send you guys perfectly working code ...

 Of course it doesn't do that. That would be buggy. The defaults only
 apply if you haven't yet set individual preferences. Perhaps you can be
 more specific? It would help if you explain the behavior you see more
 precisely and explain what you would have expected to see.
 
 Thanks,

 Well, I made a mistake when running my test. Now, I cannot reproduce
 the problem. Here's what I did. Please explain what you did and perhaps
 we can figure out what's wrong.
 
   1) delete ~/mred.pre (on windows -- under unix delete ~/.mred.prefs)
   2) start up drscheme
   3) set the language level to graphical full shceme without debugging
   4) quit drscheme
   5) copy ~/mred.pre (or ~/.mred.prefs) to plt/collects/defaults/prefs.ss
   6) delete ~/mred.pre (or ~/.mred.prefs)
   7) restart drscheem
   -) drscheme is in the graphical full scheme langauage level.
 
 Did you do something similar? Does that sequence of steps work for you?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
