 It only seems to occur when I open the contour window, click on
 something in the contour window to have the editor scroll, and then
 close the window.

 I can see how this might happen if a mouse movement event for a window
 that is invisible comes in. It somehow the user hits menukey-u, then
 moves the mouse, then drscheme processes the menukey-u which hides a
 window, but the mouse movement in the hidden window still happens.
 
 Is that possible? (should it be?)

 It shouldn't be possible, but I'll check when I have some way to run
 Windows.

asked submitter for steps to reproduce -- if some come, I'll reopen.

 Thanks for the report.
 
 Unfortunately, I can't seem to make the bug happen, but code inspection
 suggests that a strange sequence of gui events could trigger such a
 error. I've committed a fix that guards against that state, but if you
 can tell me how to reproduce the bug reliably, that would be a help.

 1) Open DrScheme (with or without loading a document)
 2) Open the contour window via Ctrl+U or the View menu.
 3) Click in the contour window
 4) Close the contour window via Ctrl+U
 5) Watch it crash
 
 The error does not occur when the contour window is closed via the
 View menu.
 
 (Sorry about sending this twice...)
