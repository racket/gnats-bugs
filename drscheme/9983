>Description:
Certain key combinations turn on Overwrite mode.

(I suspect Esc-o is the one I keep hitting,
but maybe I just don't know where the "Insert"
key is on my keyboard.)

Anyway, eventually I notice that I've typed
over a bunch of text, and I see the mode 
indicator in the bottom of the DrScheme 
window that says "Overwrite"... but what I 
don't see is how to turn Overwrite off.

(I have seen students in this predicament
in the past; while one might say that this provides
the students with motivation to explore
the interface and find out about the key-bindings
list, I would argue that a frustrated student is
more likely to close DrScheme and re-open it to
try to solve the "problem.")

As an experienced user of DrScheme, *I* know
how to find the information I need in the 
Keybindings list (eventually), but I think
beginners should be given more direct guidance
here.

What sort of guidance could DrScheme provide
for a user in Overwrite mode?  Any of the following
would be an improvement:

1. There's no menu item directly related to 
   toggling Overwrite, so a breadth-first search
   fails the user there.  I would think adding
   a Overwrite-toggle to one of the menus would
   be a trivial change.  Or...

2. Hovering the mouse over the "Overwrite" mode
   indicator does not tell me anything, and 
   right-clicking the "Overwrite" mode 
   indicator does not tell me anything.  Either
   of these could either pop-up a help text 
   that tells me the current key-binding for
   toggling overwrite mode, or it could pop up 
   a context-menu where I could switch back to
   Insert mode with the mouse.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Close your eyes and Esc-o "by accident"

2. Uselessly explore the DrScheme UI in an
   attempt to figure out how to switch back to
   Insert mode.

 Isn't this exactly the answer to the below -- instead of another menu
 item or right-click you just need to hit the insert key?  (Is there
 any keyboard these days without such a key?)

 I don't know where the Insert key is on my MacBook Pro (MBP).
 
 Here's a picture someone else took of their MBP keyboard.  I don't see  
 an Insert key on it either.

 Perhaps this is solely a Mac issue and so we needn't worry about it  
 for beginners, because as we all know Macs are not targeted at novice  
 users.  ;)

 Eli, I am glad Felix explained this patiently to you. Your answer was

 Sorry about any possible inappropriateness -- it's just that in the
 world of PC keyboards there has an `insert' key since sometime around
 the mid 80s.  (And for some reason I only rememberd the lack of
 `backspace' key on OSX, not a lack of `insert' key too.)

 But Eli: the presence or absense of that key is irrelevant!! That is
 the root of why your reply isn't good. The point is that novices won't
 know how to switch back to the original modality and obvious places to
 look aren't helpful.

 (FWIW, IMO this is the least desirable solution.  More menu clutter
 for very little benefit -- just like a "caps lock" menu entry.)

 I thought of that too, but the caps key usually has a little light on
 the keyboard. If insert mode had that, I would not feel the need for
 the menu.
 
 "least" out of the three possibilites, ie:
 
  - menu item
  - get rid of insert mode
  - have a dialog
 
 ?
 
 Or did I miss one?

 Does the middle one include a preference for turning insert-mode
 support back on? If so, it sounds best to me.

 In my opinion, the pop-up is preferable to the menu entry. My guess is  
 that there are currently 0 people in the world who switch between  
 insert & overwrite mode in DrScheme more than once every five minutes.

 Just a parenthetical remark: an Emacs user would find this exchange about
 three choices somewhat bewildering.  In Emacs, it would be obvious that the
 way to implement this is with a message in the minibuffer: "Insert/Overwrite
 toggle turned off, <action> to turn it on".  That way, if someone *really*
 wanted it, they would hit Insert a few times and eventually see the message
 (assuming they missed it the first time) and then know what to do.

 That seems like the graphically poor way of doing the dialog box. So I
 guess what you're saying is that chosing some of the three (or however
 many) options are "bewildering", ie stupid. Why not jsut say that?

 This seems to be a common opinion at this point. I suspect that there
 are people who like to toggle modes, but that is also doable with a
 dialog box (ie having a check box in the dialog box that avoids the
 dialog box in the future.
 
 Still, it was easier to just add a preference, and I think we've
 probably talked this to death by now. So I added the preference
 (defaults to disabled). This means that no one will trip over
 overwrite mode accidentally now. You must first enable it before you
 can trip over it. Hopefully we won't get too many complaints about
 'missing overwrite mode' or else I'll have to go with the dialog.
 
 Ride me to the glue factory, horse!

 I know you said you've closed this, but your response here is bizarre.
  Apparently my message wasn't clear enough, so I'll say it more
 explicitly: there is a fourth, good, option, which is a non-popup
 communication space, such as the minibuffer in Emacs.  Having it in
 Emacs offers an additional communication modality that makes thinking
 about various choices a lot easier.

 Probably I should get to that someday. For now, the modeline in
 DrScheme, as I'm sure you're aware, since I've mentioned it many times
 before, has 10 or so fixed things that can currently even all appear
 at once, so there isn't really space for more stuff. There is, of
 course, a way to make additional lines at the bottom, but I'm sure you
 or someone else would complain that they take up too much space were I
 to use them (in this case anyway).
 
 Regardless of all that, I still think that a dialog box with some kind
 of "don't ask me again" check box is more appropriate that a question
 that would be asked in the minibuffer in Emacs for this particular
 interaction with the user. It also happens to more in keeping with
 modern GUI norms.

 As a UI design matter, Emacs separates the modeline from the
 minibuffer.  The modeline is the line one up from the bottom (in ASCII
 displays), not the bottom line.
 
 It's true that right now, DrScheme is not built around the idea of
 having a minibuffer to flash information, so an extra "line" would
 probably be considered wasted space.
 
 You know, on my G1 (Android) when there's a status message, a little
 icon goes off on the top line, which is also the modeline (where it
 says "wifi on", "bluetooth on", etc).  You drag down the modeline, and
 you get to see the actual messages.  Analogously, you would need just
 one fixed space of icon to say "you have a status message".  Clicking
 on it could be as simple as popping up a window -- but the popup
 happens on the user's demand (when they are mentally expecting one,
 and are ready for the interruption).  But the status icon just blinks
 when there's a new status.  So the user gets a non-intrusive,
 non-modal notification, you can still have full text messages, but it
 takes up a fixed amount of space.

 That would be nice. I'll think about something like that for later, thanks.
 
 But I don't see how it would help with the current predicament. The
 problem is users accidentally getting into overwrite mode and not
 being able to get out, so a little 'you have a message' icon probably
 would be about as helpful as the menu item that I just added (ie, not
 useless, but probably not a huge help).

 FWIW, I hate Emacs's messages. At least the ones I know go away with  
 the next keystroke, so that by the time you need the content, you  
 have no clue what it said. When I edited Scheme in Emacs, this would  
 be a reasonably frequent thing and it was the one thing I disliked  
 about Emacs.

 What I proposed doesn't have this problem.  I accidentally sent it to

 There's a "*Messages*" buffer that has the last of these messages
 logged.  (Just mentioning it in case Robby implements something
 similar: the simple solution is to make such a log available.)

 Firefox has another mechanism for some alerts and warnings. When an 
 interesting event occurs (popup blocked, password entered, etc) Firefox 
 adds a panel to the top of the browsing area with a message, optional 
 context-sensitive actions (change popup blocking policy, remember the 
 password, etc), and a close button. It doesn't interrupt everything like 
 a modal dialog, but it has the dialog's virtue of context-sensitive 
 action buttons. That, together with the fact that it doesn't disappear 
 on its own, also makes it superior to minibuffer messages.
 
 When a programmer hits the Insert key in overwrite-disabled mode, 
 DrScheme should show a message panel explaining that overwrite mode is 
 disabled by default. The panel should have, in addition to the dismiss 
 button, a button for opening the preferences window at the right panel 
 to change the behavior of Insert.
 
 Check Syntax already does something similar to report syntax errors. 
 Some other places places that might benefit from this style of message 
 are the stepper and macro stepper, to report out-of-sync stepping 
 sessions, and the definitions and interactions buffers, to report open 
 bracket/paren correction. In the latter case, the message should have 
 buttons for the paren-correction preferences.
 
 --
 
 As a separate note, I also like the idea of extending DrScheme's status 
 bar with additional icons. The GC already has one. I think everyone 
 would love a little "Downloading PLaneT packages" icon that explained 
 why execution was taking longer than usual.
