>Description:
The default mode of saving bug reports when the window is closed is questionable
IMO.  It's easy to end up with a bogus saved report without knowing it, which can
be confusing later when I see something that I didn't ask for explicitly.  It would
have been nice to notify the user about saving it; better to ask about discarding
it.

Another related problem is that the report is saved even if it contains no
information at all.  So if I happen to get the dialog by mistake and I quickly
close the window, I'm left with a saved entry -- but in this case it should just
be discarded.
