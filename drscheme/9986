>Description:
When I use "Insert Large Letters" with
*certain* text strings and *certain* 
pairs of fonts, switching which font 
to insert does not always update the
mini-preview next to the font combo box.

In particular, I have reproduced this 
when switching between the fonts:
Arial Narrow and Arial Narrow Italic
with the input text "xtymz/"

I have not been able to derive the 
exact characteristics that dictate
when this bug occurs; it seems that 
the presence of the *subsequence*
(not substring) "tm/" is enough to
reproduce it.  "tym" also suffices.
I have also reproduced this when
toggling between Arial Narrow Bold
and Arial Narrow Bold Italic.
Based on further experiments, there
seems to be strong correlation between
1. choosing a font and its Italic 
variant to reproduce the bug, and, 
2. choosing text with either a #\/ or
a #\y character in it to reproduce the
bug.

(Note that the maxi-preview showing the 
actual semi-colons *is* updated with the
font shift; thats one reason why this 
bug is non-critical, and also why I am
certain that this is not just an issue
with the fonts on my machine.
Another reason it is non-critical is 
that there's an obvious workaround for
the user -- select an unrelated font 
in between the pair).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Choose menu item:
   Insert..Insert Large Letters

2. In the "text to insert:" field, type:
   xtymz/

3. In the fonts combo box, choose Arrial Narrow

4. Look at the preview to the right of font combo box.

5. In the fonts combo box, choose Arial Narrow Italic

6. Note that the big semi-colon text has changed, but the
   preview to the right of the font combo box has not.

 I think I've fixed it in the latest SVN.
 
 Thanks,
