 I'm sorry Matthias, I don't quite understand what you wronte.. Were in the
 process of analyzing (ie spidey was churning) and you did File|Open?

 1. Pick a multi-file program. 
 
 2. Analyze. 
 
 3. Pick and poke at various things in one of the files. 
 
 4. Go back to a proper DrS window and try to open one of the files.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

I tried to reproduce this, but couldn't. (A number of things in
drs/mrs have changed since the bug was submitted).

I did notice that DrScheme's File|Open... won't open a file if a
MrSpidey window is already open on that file - instead the MrSpidey
window is pushed to the foreground.

The converse is ok - MrSpidey's File|Open... opens spidey windows,
even if a corresponding DrScheme window already exists.

 Ugh. This was (yet another) a long awaited piece of functionality for some
 users (since it works for general mred and drscheme windows) that makes
 things strange in the tools.
 
 I think that in this case we may have to change Spidey a little to fix
 this. In order to determine whether to open a new file or to bring an old
 window to the front, mred asks each frame what it's file is. If any of the
 frame filenames agree with the requested filename, the frame is pushed to
 the front; otherwise a new frame is opened.
 
 So, the spidey frames are in some sense claimeing to be editing the file:
 
 	     (send (send spidey-frame get-edit) get-filename)
 
 but in fact they aren't. So it would seem best to have some way of turning
 off the filename and then having spidey turn it off for it's frames.
 
 Make sense? Agree?
