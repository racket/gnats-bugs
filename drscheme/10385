>Description:
In certain conditions, the yellow status bar that says "WARNING: the definitions window has changed. Click Run." won't close when you click the (X) button.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a fresh DrScheme.
2. Add a newline to the definitions window.
3. Without clicking Run, evaluate something at the REPL to get the warning.
4. Leave the warning open and create a new tab.
5. In the new tab, add a newline to the definitions window.
6. Without clicking Run, evaluate something at the REPL to get the warning in this new tab.
7. Now try to close the warning: it won't close.
>Fix:
The close button was closing the message in the original tab.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 05 Aug 2009 19:09:25 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the report.
