Try this program:

(define x
  (match-lambda*
    [(a ()) 3]
    [(a (b . c)) 5]))

Then run Check Syntax.  It complains.  Try Execute.  It works.

(The error it gives is ``Improper-list syntax invalid in this position'')

 Unfortunately, before you click execute check syntax does not know about
 the macros that will be loaded when the require-library form is
 evaluated. After you click execute, check syntax should work
 correctly. This kind of problem will disappear when we have ironed out the
 details of the module language. Sorry!
