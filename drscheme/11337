>Description:
Run this program:
(define (loop-forever l)
  (begin
    (+ 1 2)
    (loop-forever (cons 1 l))))
The entire body is highlighted as lacking coverage.

Now run
(loop-forever empty)

Eventually DrRacket pops up the "want to stop?" dialog.  But when the program stops, the coverage highlighting still hasn't changed, even though the function's body has patently been covered.

In contrast, if you explicitly Stop execution, the coverage changes as expected.
