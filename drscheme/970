>Description:
read-char, read-line etc doesn't behave on the GUI environment:
- if you enter input that is all whitespaces, it continues to wait for
  more intput before returnning the correct value;
- the same happens with lines that start with ";" or "#|";
- an internal error occurs when you type something followed by spaces.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start MrEd/DrScheme, enter (read-line) or (read-char), type some spaces &
newlines to see that it doesn't return, then type a letter followed by a
space.
