the problem: the predicate that deteremined if the
editor had been messed with wasn't correct. It 
checked to see if the third line in the interactions
canvas was the last line, but when teachpacks 
were set, it wasn't. (the predicate is this way, since
editing the interactions cancels this feature)

 I cannot reproduce this bug.
 
 Can you re-test, please? You have to make sure that you don't type
 anything in that window (even if you delete it, that doesn't count).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 To reproduce this bug, first set a teachpack. Then restart drscheme. In
 the new drscheme, opening a file for the first time opens a new window.
