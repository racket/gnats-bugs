this was a contract violation at the wrong level. If Scheme
were a typed language, it probably would have been a type error at the wrong level, since the code was essentially
reading part of the program.

 Is there some reader setting I need to set to make this work?
 
 When I search for "r6rs" or "#!r6rs" via f1 in drscheme, I only get
 set to the r6rs manual, instead of getting a search page. Eli: is that
 intentional?

 Oh! Probably.
 
 Should I avoid doing that in check syntax now? Or only do it in
 certain languages or something else?

 I notice that if I put a blank line before `#!r6rs, then it works.
 
 Maybe something is still doing the equivalent of
 `strip-shell-command-start'?

 It's never needed anymore. `#!' as an executable she-bang reads as a
 comment.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 24 Mar 2008 21:38:58 -0400
Reason>>> fixed in SVN. Thanks for the report!

Note that there are still issues with Check Syntax and #!r6rs 
(like no arrows showing up). I'm still looking into them.

 Thanks. That's fixed.
 
 Any ideas why no arrows show up in r6rs mode? With this:
 
 #!r6rs
 (import (rnrs))
 (let ([x 1])
   x)
 
 I don't see arrows on the let or the x.

 Yes -- it happens when there is a single result.  Perhaps I should not
 do that by default?  (Seems that the danger is that the reaction would
 be "something is wrong, let me try again" x 3, and then report a bug.)

 I expect that it's a problem with the R6RS reader. I'll look into it.

 Yeah, that's what I did. :)
 
 But I like that behavior. In this case, my assumption is that the bug
 is in the searching engine for not finding "#!r6rs" and other such
 things. Am I wrong about that?

 Matthew fixed the problem with the arrows too, so Check Syntax should
 be back in working order.

 Well, if you did do the above (= you thought that it's a bug) then it
 sounds like this behavior should change, no?

 Sorry -- I wasn't clear. I think it is a bug, but not in the
 searching. It is a bug in the docs (so to speak) of a missing index
 entry point.

 Unless, of course, hitting f1 on "#!r6rs" only searches for "r6rs".

 Yes, and that's what I said sounds right...

 (That, I have no clue about.)

 f1 on #!r6rs searches for #!r6rs, not r6rs.
 
 FWIW.

 Thanks guys!  Check Syntax is way useful.  
 
 The arrows still don't seem to be working fully with the
 3.99.0.20-svn25mar2008 I just installed.  With this:
 
 #!r6rs
 (import (rnrs))
 
 (let ([x 1])
   x)
 
 I get the pink arrow from x to let showing the continuation, but the
 blue arrow from the x binding clause to the x reference is not showing
 for me.  
 
 (JTMI, I might be out of contact the next few days).

 Thanks.
 
 (Technically, the pink arrow is showing where the syntactic tail positions are.)
