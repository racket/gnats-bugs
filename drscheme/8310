>Description:
I've got a lot of fonts installed on my system, so the "Font Name" drop-down menu in the preferences pane (Font tab, DrScheme subtab) is quite long.

Unfortunately, the entries on that list are not in any order that I can detect.  For example, it doesn't even group all the "Lucida" fonts together.

It'd be really nifty if the entires in this list were sorted alphabetically by font name.  (I don't have any good ideas about what to do with fonts whose names begin with Asian characters -- throw 'em all at the end of the list, or something.)

 Is this something that mred should do (via the result of the primitive)
 or drscheme should do?
