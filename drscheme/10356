>Description:
If editing a "new line" in the REPL, control-up sets the current line to the most recently run expression. Control-down then, however, sets the current line to the least recently run expression instead of the partially composed new line. Control-up and Control-down should be inverses.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type some complicated text in the REPL
2. Press control-up (e.g. by mistake)
3. Press control-down
4. Instead of the complicated text, find the least recently run expression instead
>Fix:
