 Thanks. I've fixed that, but only in my private clone of the
 respository (I have other check syntax changes there waiting to go in
 the main branch).
 
 That has long bugged me too. What it does now is get the x,y
 coordinates of the beginning of the identifier and the w,h of the
 visible region of the editor and does this:
 
                   (send src scroll-editor-to
                         (max 0 (- x (* .1 w)))
                         (max 0 (- y (* .1 h)))
                         w h
                         #t
                         'none)
 
 Opinions?

 It sounds like a very good compromise against a bunch of
 special-casing (which anyway won't work in some corner cases, just
 like #anchors in HTML sometimes don't).

 That's slightly trickier since (I assume) you only want to do that
 when the thing being found is off the screen already. But I think it
 is doable.

 Here's the whole code:
 
           (let ([admin (send src get-admin)])
             (when admin
               (let ([wb (box 0.0)]
                     [hb (box 0.0)]
                     [xb (box 0.0)]
                     [yb (box 0.0)])
                 (send admin get-view #f #f wb hb)
                 (send src position-location (- pos 1) xb yb #t #f #t)
                 (let ([w (unbox wb)]
                       [h (unbox hb)]
                       [x (unbox xb)]
                       [y (unbox yb)])
                   (send src scroll-editor-to
                         (max 0 (- x (* .1 w)))
                         (max 0 (- y (* .1 h)))
                         w h
                         #t
                         'none)))))
 
 If the methods in the editor weren't so ugly, it would just look like this:
 
           (let ([admin (send src get-admin)])
             (when admin
               (let-values ([(w h) (send admin get-view-size)]
                            [(x y) (send src position-location (- pos 1))])
                 (send src scroll-editor-to
                       (max 0 (- x (* .1 w)))
                       (max 0 (- y (* .1 h)))
                       w h
                       #t
                       'none))))
 
 and given the slightly different functions being computed, my opinion
 is that having a single point of control would actually impair the
 readability/maintainability of the code, since you'd have a shared
 function that essentially was just this:
 
                       (max 0 (- x (* .1 w)))
                       (max 0 (- y (* .1 h)))
 
 plus the calls to get-view-size and position-location. Not to mention
 that it isn't clear what library this function would live in.

 I hadn't thought of that, but I think you're right (too much jumping).
 
 If the editor doesn't scroll, then nothing except the Find oval
 moves/appears, and its location should visually register even if it's
 on the editor's last visible line.

 Turns out that this was already there. Just that if a line was
 partially visible (even just one pixel of it), it wouldn't scroll. So
 I've made it always scroll when the search hit is on the last
 (possibly partially visible) line. Hopefully that'll work better.
