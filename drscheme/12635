>Description:
In the DrRacket Multi File Search dialog, after selecting a line in the 'found' window (the top display panel) the contents of the top display panel sometimes scrolls, as if to center the selected line. However there are issues. 

Note that the scrolling appears to be only 'up', i.e. the selected line always drops down in the window; the first displayed row in the 'found' window is always closer to the beginning of the set.

Sometimes the window is scrolled too much, causing the selected line to disappear 'below' the set of visible rows. e.g. the displayed rows are the 40th through 60th occurrences of the search string, even though the 65th occurrence was selected (when the 60th through 80th rows were displayed).

My preference would be to stop the scrolling altogether - having the window's contents (sometimes) shift after clicking one of the lines is disorienting.
>How-To-Repeat:
Perform a Multi File Search that results in many (i.e. thousands) of 'found' occurrences (e.g. search for letter 'e').

Scroll down at least a third of the way through the list.

Select a 'found' occurrence.

Observe that window scrolls. Sometimes the window scrolls only one line, sometimes many more.

 Ah! I think I see. Something about the paths under windows is probably
 causing the load-file method to behave differently under mac os x (where I
 was testing) and under windows. So I've shortcircuited the call to
 load-file in the code I pointed you to before, and so hopefully you'll see
 the same behavior I see.
 
 I'll give this a try myself under windows, but if you have the chance to
 use the nightly build and/or build from git, it would also be great to get
 confirmation.

 I've just started looking into this and, unfortunately, I'm not seeing the
 behavior you report. In particular, what I see is that when the line with
 the search "hit" is already visible, there is no scrolling. When it is off
 the screen to the top, it scrolls up, and when it is off the screen to the
 bottom, it scrolls down.
 
 The specific search I tried was to search for "e" in
 plt/collects/drracket/private (and there are lots of hits there; somewhere
 in the neighborhood of 24,000 I believe).
 
 And just in case you want to have a closer look with your example in an
 effort to help me see the problem, the code in question is in the
 'show-this-match' thunk on line 234 in
 collects/drracket/private/multi-file-search.rkt. At least, I think that's
 the code in question-- if it isn't, that might explain a lot!
 
 Anyways, that code just calls the text% class's set-position method, which
 is what does the actual scrolling (this method gets called a lot in the
 system to move the insertion point around and has a bunch of smarts to try
 to scroll "properly" to make the insertion point visible).

 I am still seeing the problem in 5.3.0.10 even though it now seems to be harder to replicate. Previously I could replicate readily, but now some amount of scrolling up and down through the list of hits and clicking on some particular row is required before the list of hits scrolls.
 
 Note that the (unwanted) scrolling I am seeing occurs in the top (list of hits) pane. The bottom (hit in context) pane has always scrolled as expected.

 Oh. Thanks for clarifying that. FWIW, I didn't change anything wrt to
 that so the change in behavior you're seeing is from some other cause.
 
 I'm also not seeing anything from code inspection that would have this
 behavior, so I'm a bit stuck.
