>Description:
There's no "delete word backwards" keybinding. Looking at the list of normally active mindings, both M-del and Esc,Del seem to be bound to "backward-kill-word" but neither works. Ctrl-Del is a pretty conventional keybinding for it.

 This is likely one of the backspace/delete issues that were fixed
 after 4.2 came out -- I see that M-delete is doing that in the svn
 version.
 
 But the bad thing, IMO, is that this is the wrong key for that.  I
 think that a consistent interface would be: ctrl for word navigation,
 alt (or meta, or escape) for expression navigation, so C-backspace
 should delete a word, M-backspace deletes the last expresion, and
 *-delete do the forward deletions.

 Ah! I *just* checked 10321, noticed it was fixed in SVN, and thought I 
 should kick off a SVN build. :-)

 That sounds exactly correct.
