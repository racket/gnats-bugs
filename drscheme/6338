>Description:
In DrScheme prefs, check `Reuse existing frames when opening files'.

Type some text in the defs window.

Select File | New; choose `Clear Current' (and `clear anyway' if 
necessary).

Error message:

regexp-match: expects type <string or input-port> as 2nd argument, given: #f; other arguments were: #rx"\\.txt$"

After this, defns window does not graphically update in real-time;
hiding & redrawing the entire DrScheme window will force the
defns window to redraw.  (No edits are lost; they just don't display
immediately.)
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
