With the new-style "Configure Language" window, I can change 
language settings and I don't get any warning that I need to 
restart drscheme, unless I happen to know that there's some
important message behind Show Details.

The new-style window makes it very convenient to append a warning
message in the same window describing when the changes take effect.
That way, the user is sure to see it because it's not cluttered
among a bunch of other stuff.

 Does anyone want to propose where I should put said warning? (thinking of
 course about how the warning will look in both show and hide details mode)

 Bring up a box with a 
 
 	ThankYou 
 
 button that makes it disappear.

 When the language level is changed the first time you mean?

put a warning the first time the language is changed, but only if that

 With details hidden, the only thing I can change is the Language,
 at it requires restarting.  I'd put the message in the same panel
 between the Language choices and the row of buttons.  It's this
 case that most needs some message.
 
 With details shown, it's reasonable enough to say that the existing
 warnings are enough.
 
 Alternatively, you could wait until the user clicks OK and then
 bring up a modal dialog box.

 Sorry -- I went ahead and brought up a dialog, on the first time the user
 changes the language, without seeing details.

Can someone propose where I should put said warning?

Thanks,
