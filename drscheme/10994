>Description:
When you run the program below (from the Racket home page), DrRacket prints the unhelpful message:

DrRacket.exe: expects <dice> <sides> on the command line, given 0 arguments

1. Why is the ".exe" there?

2. Much more to the point, there is no indication that you CAN run this program from within DrRacket: just set the command line values in the extended language menu!

Incidentally, on Windows 7, the default value looks like "hash zero".  My first instinct was to backspace once, and type "2=(...".  It was on the first backspace that I realized it was a pair of parens.  I suggest either

- switching to proportional text (since it is, after all, a "code" context), or

- making the default value be "#( )".

 Regardless of the errors that you get from running drracket, this is
 intended to be run as a script, via the "racket" executable.  If you
 click the "?" on the top-right of the example code, it pops up some
 explanation text which should explain how to run it.  It could
 probably use some work for people on Windows though.

 (If this should be mentioned, then it would go into that blurb, but I
 have no idea how to do that without making it too long...)

 Yeah, I know all that.  But the reason for putting small, entirely
 self-contained examples on the home page was presumably so people
 would copy and run them and quickly see the effect.

 For many people, dumping it in a file and running `racket' on it *is*
 what they'd do for trying things out...  (And yes, there are some
 pieces of code that wouldn't work this way.)

 Since it appears I was unclear (at least to Eli), let me clarify: my
 whole message is about DrRacket, NOT the Web page.
 
 In particular, I am suggesting that the error message can indicate how
 to use the command line.
 
 I am not suggesting any changes to the presentation on the Web.

 I second the general comment on scripts/command line arguments. 
 
 Indeed, I have always wanted the command line 'thing' 
 to show up somewhere in DrRacket so that people know it exists. 
 
 Perhaps it should show up only when the first line is 
 
   #! /bin/sh
   #|
   exec /Users/matthias/plt/bin/racket -qu "$0" ${1+"$@"}
   |#
 
 or something like that but it should show up so that 
 script developers know there is a "mini sandbox." 
 
 I do understand the limited amount of DrRacket real estate. 
 Let's see whether we can find space anyway. 
 
 Indeed, now that we have sandboxes I think we may wish 
 to revisit the idea of adding a script development 'box'
 to DrRacket.

 p.s. I am not sure that using the error message to point 
 to the command line is the right thing.

 What about some kind of a special lang thing?
 
  #lang argv #(quoted-reader-expression-here) racket/base
 
 could mean "run in racket/base with the command-line set to the thing
 asked for in the argv"?
 
 But in reality, I have had a lot of success with using the
 'command-line' tool and writing this:
 
 (command-line
   ;; #:argv #("the args I'm playing with")
   ...)
 
 where I comment & uncomment that line.

 1. I use that, too. And I have forgotten to uncomment the line and got  
 bad results (fortunately my "databases" are backed up).
 
 2. I think that you should write down the entire command line as if  
 you were at the shell and the IDE should
   -- check that it correctly invokes the script
   -- send the argv vector to the interactive evaluation
 
 3. We should consider additional conveniences for developing scripts,  
 e.g., fake file systems.
