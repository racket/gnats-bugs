>Description:
Hi, Have you thought about optionally (or by default) thought about displaying the file in which a error
occurs in a new window instead of the current one?  Whenever I click on an error link in a Backtrace,
window 9 times out of 10 I fix the error and end up having to reopen the original file, research though 
the file to figure out what I was just looking at. A right click context menu could work well. Thanks - EA

 I'm not sure what you mean. It does open a new window, for me. Unless 
 you have the preference set that re-uses the current window, but then 
 it always uses the same window.

 Did you enable the single window preferences yourself, or did it 
 somehow mysteriously turn itself on for you?
