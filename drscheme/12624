 Just to confirm: you are saying that the minimum width of the DrRacket
 window is more than 1080 pixels?

 No, The window is full screened in a screen 1080x1920 (so the width is 1080px, height of 1920px)
 
 I just check and the window size doesn't affect it. It only occurs on my monitor of said size.
