>Description:
The documentation says color-list->image takes in an image and four natural numbers, but in fact it complains if the width and/or height parameters are zero.
>How-To-Repeat:
(color-list->image empty 0 10 0 0)
>Fix:
These functions just didn't deal with the special case of zero width/height images. They do now.
>Release-Note:
The contract was correct for the function, but out of sync with the documentation. So this was a contract error (the wrong contract). Fixing the contract led to another contract error which, when fixed, fixed the original problem.

Reason>>> Thanks for the report. This has been fixed in SVN and will
be in the next release.
