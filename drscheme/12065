Windows 7
>Description:
Observed during PBD: Under Windows 7, if a check-expect test fails and the test dialog window covers the main definitions window, when the user closes the test dialog window, the definitions window does not refresh, and the user just sees a blank screen.  The GUI subsystem is not properly refreshing the window.

Forcing a refresh with a scroll-down or scroll-up is a workaround.

 I use windows 7 routinely and have not seen this behavior. Can you
 reproduce it from a fresh drracket? If so, can you send some fairly
 detailed steps?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Unfortunately, I haven't been able to reproduce it myself yet.  I've
 seen it happen about four times to the PBD teachers over the course of
 the week, so whatever condition is triggering this, it's rare, but not
 too rare.
