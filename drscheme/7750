>Description:
I am storing the top-level continuation in a variable (error-abort), to define an error procedure of my own (that displays the arguments and aborts to the toplevel), but the continuation only works once in every two calls.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have the following code in the definitions window:

(define (display* . args)
  (for-each display args)
  (newline))

(define (error . args)
  (apply display* (cons "!!! " args))
  (error-abort))

(define error-abort #f)
(call-with-current-continuation (lambda (k) (set! error-abort k)))

Welcome to DrScheme, version 299.400p1.
Language: Standard (R5RS).

i.e: error only works one time in two.
This is weird, but:

And it happens all the time (one time I had to do the call to call-with-continuation TWICE before it started to have the desired behaviour).

In DrScheme 209 it behaves normally.

 This has been fixed in the latest pre-releases.
