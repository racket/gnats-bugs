>Description:
When def'ns window contains a function call with parameters on separate lines,
followed by a second expression on the same line,
the indentation algorithm aligns the following line with the second expression
rather than at the left margin.
>How-To-Repeat:
(copies 0
        "hello") "should be" empty
(copies 1
        "hello) "should be" (cons "hello" empty)

Type this in, or copy-and-paste it and select "Reindent all".
The problem does NOT occur if the parameters to "copies" are all on one line.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sowens" by eli at Wed, 14 Jul 2004 14:20:24 -0400
Reason>>> indentation

Responsible changed from "sowens" to "mflatt" by sowens at Sat, 17 Jul 2004 10:22:25 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew recently worked on the indenter some.  Perhaps it is his 
responsibility.


Responsible changed from "mflatt" to "robby" by robby at Tue, 04 Mar 2008 18:49:56 -0500
Reason>>> I fixed this.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 04 Mar 2008 18:49:56 -0500
Reason>>> duplicate of 9237, which is now closed.

Thanks for the PR and thanks for the tip that
I should search for other PRs you submitted.

(This one was marked as Matthew's responsibility,
but I think that was a mistake.)
