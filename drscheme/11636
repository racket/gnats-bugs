>Description:
As the subject says.  Looks like there are several reasons for this, the most
obvious is broken code in "drracket/private/unit.rkt" -- in the `on-move' override
the `on-move-timer-args' variable is set to `#f' right before its value is used
to set the preference.

Fixing this is trivial, but I'm not doing this because of what looks like a more
serious problem: after I fixed it, it still didn't save the right position...  I've
played with it a little, and it looks like when the window is moved this `on-move'
is not being called at all -- and that's on both my XP laptop and the linux server.

Maximizing the window and restoring it does call the method, but it looks like it's
calling it with the previous position rather than the new one.  At least this is
what I've seen in some cases, and in other cases it doesn't change at all.

 (BTW, looks like there might be similar problems with saving the
 maximized state, but there's too much brokenness in the above to tell
 for sure.)

 I think I disabled this because of problems with multiple monitors and
 not having the racket/gui-level support to be able to tell if I was
 opening the new window in a reasonable place.
 
 Judging from the docs, that situation does not seem to have changed,
 so DrRacket'll just continue to not save this preference.

Reason>>> Need more support from the lower layer.

I think a reasonable thing would be to get a list of
rectangles; then I could figure out if the saved position
was still valid when a new window opens
