[[I have distilled a report I got via Email from Spencer into a small 'test case'. -- Matthias]]

When you create a file in drracket GIT HEAD with teachpacks set and then open this file in 5.3.6, 
drracket signals the following error message: 

Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.3.6 [3m].
Language: Intermediate Student [custom].
Teachpacks: teachpack/2htdp/universe.rkt and teachpack/2htdp/image.rkt.
require: expected at least two strings with lib, found only 1 parts
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create file in git head. Say 
   "(define x 10)"

2. Set teachpacks via menu (I used image and universe but I suspect others cause that problem too). 

3. Save as foo.rkt. 

4. Quit. 

5. Open foo.rkt in drrackt v 5.3.6 

6. Run. See above error.

 I'm not really seeing a good fix for this, unfortunately. The save file
 format doesn't have a "this is a version from the future" mechanism built
 into it by which it could reject the file and contorting the git version
 (and all future versions) to work with 5.3.6 (and earlier) seems painful.
 
 Is there perhaps some other way to deal with whatever the original problem
 was?

 Okay, I thought of a better way to handle this and I'll push a fix shortly.

 <br>
 Reported by spencer for release: 5.3.6<br>
 <br>
 *** Description:<br>
 [[I have distilled a report I got via Email from Spencer into a small &#39;=
 test case&#39;. -- Matthias]]<br>
 <br>
 When you create a file in drracket GIT HEAD with teachpacks set and then op=
 en this file in 5.3.6,<br>
 drracket signals the following error message:<br>
 <br>
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.3.6 [3m].<br>
 Language: Intermediate Student [custom].<br>
 Teachpacks: teachpack/2htdp/universe.rkt and teachpack/2htdp/image.rkt.<br>
 require: expected at least two strings with lib, found only 1 parts<br>
 <br>
 *** How to repeat:<br>
 1. Create file in git head. Say<br>
 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&quot;(define x 10)&quot;<br>
 <br>
 2. Set teachpacks via menu (I used image and universe but I suspect others =
 cause that problem too).<br>
 <br>
 3. Save as foo.rkt.<br>
 <br>
 4. Quit.<br>
 <br>
 5. Open foo.rkt in drrackt v 5.3.6<br>
 <br>
 6. Run. See above error.<br>

 There is. I usually don't post *sl files but text that students paste =
 into drracket.=20
 But I leaked one with a header and Spencer found that one -- Matthias
