>Description:
One of the biggest way to improve the usability of Dr. Scheme would be to introduce a method of recalling our last typed interaction in the prompt window. If you have ever used a Linux/Unix shell you know that by pressing the up arrow
the last command entered is displayed, and pressing UP again bring the previous command before that, etc.

As a Scheme student I often find myself entering the same or a similar command many times while debugging procedures.
Another issue I have noticed is that on the Linux platform, cut/copy/paste are mapped to META/X,C,V (Meta = Alt on most systems)
I would prefer the standard mapping of cut/copy/paste to the control key, and to have the clipboard content kept separate from the current copied selection.
(If I am confusing you, just ask one of the Linux/Unix developers, they will understand quite well.)

Thank you, and I enjoy using your product.

 Try escape p or meta-p. For next try escape next or meta next. Also  
 look at Edit | Keybindings.
 It's a cheat-sheet for these things. -- Matthias

 Try using
 
   meta-p
 
 to go to the interactions history.
