>Description:
It appears the DrRacket REPL is stuck between two conflicting desires:

- to show the REPL
- to show the location of an error

Conjecture: the error expression keeps re-evaluating, and therefore happening over and over.  Each time it happens, DrRacket rightly wants to show the error.  Therefore, my conjecture is that this is a bug in the FrTime evaluator, or an unavoidable consequence of its semantics.
>How-To-Repeat:
Keep a fairly small interactions window (so eventually you'll need a scroll bar) and type in a few expressions like

seconds
seconds
seconds
seconds

as many as necessary for the scroll-bar to appear.

Now create an error:

(/ 1 0)

The focus somehow keeps shifting back to having the error on screen, with the result that the REPL prompt disappears.  Hitting down-arrow shows the prompt, but only until the next update for seconds.

If instead your REPL is

seconds
(/ 1 0)
seconds
<repeat seconds as many times as necessary>

you get the same flicker more dramatically.

 I'm not sure what the best thing to do is. The error does not
 repeatedly occur. The error happens once and DrRacket shows it, but
 (conjecture time) I think that the editor-snip% for the Interactions
 Window moves the focus where "inserts" occur and the FRP snip uses
 inserts to rewrite the text. Maybe Robby can tell me how to turn that
 off so it doesn't focus on the changes?

 I think this UI bug exists even in the absence of an evaluating an
 erroneous expression.  If you have multiple reactive snips that are
 more than scrolling-distance apart, then the interactions pane will
 jump around whenever any of them changes.

 It is hard for me to say what's the right thing. Can you make
 something bad happen at just the gracket level (ie with a program that
 only uses snips and texts and frtime or drracket)?
