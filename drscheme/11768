>Description:
When you select several rows, while holding shift pressing Home selects the part of the code, that is before the selection on the first row and not the part after the last selected character on the last row.

There is also some strange behaviour when you press first 'end' then 'home', while holding 'shift'
>How-To-Repeat:
select several rows from top to bottom (the selection of the first one should not be from the beginning of the row).

Press and hold shift, then press home.

The pattern from the description has occured.

 Hi: I'm having trouble understanding what you're seeing and what you'd
 like to see. Can you give me a concrete example to work with?
 
 To give you an idea of what I'm after, here's a concrete example of
 using shift-home that seems to work properly.
 
 1) open a new drracket window
 2) insert the following text:
 
 ---cut-here---
 11
 22
 33
 44
 ---cut-here---
 
 3) Put the insertion point between the two "4"s.
 4) type shift-up twice
 
 At this point, the text starting between the two "2"s and ending
 between the two "4"s is selected.
 
 5) type shift-home
 
 At this point, the entire line containing the "2"s is selected, and
 the selection continues to the same spot as before, namely between the
 two "4"s.
 
 This one example, at least, seems like the right behavior. Or were you
 saying that if you do those steps you also expect the second "4" to be
 selected in the last step?

 I think that the way to fix this is to make extendstartpos and
 extendendpos available via a method like get-position.
 
 I'm happy to make this change, and I think that there are a lot of
 methods that need to be using this instead of the position.
 
 The other alternative seems to be to try to generalize the
 move-position method, allowing it to take an absolute position or
 something like that, but after tracing thru the code, it appears that
 typing s:left invokes this method in a way that ends up being pretty
 simple so probably the right thing is to let others just look and see
 what extendstartpos and extendendpos are and then do something based
 on that.
 
 I think that probably extendendpos and extendstartpos need to be
 settable too, but I haven't gotten that far yet; only read the code.
 
 Anyways, does this sound like the right strategy?

 Hi,
 
 There is some king of misunderstanding here. Maybe I didn't provide
 clear enough explanation. Here are the steps to reproduce the problem
 and some screenshots.
 
 1) In the definition window mark code at least 2 rows long without
 using your mouse. Instead use your keyboard by holding down the shift
 key and using the up/down arrows. Start marking from top to bottom.
 See Screenshot1
 
 2) Now if you press and hold shift and press the left/right arrow, you
 will see, that you can select/deselect characters from the last marked
 row. See Screenshot 2. So the cursor is placed on the last selected
 row and if I press 'END' button it should mark the line till the end.
 This is working as expected.
 
 3) But if you try to DESELECT the last selected line to it's
 beginning, by pressing the 'HOME' button, the row on the top is marked
 to the beginning.
 
 So what I see is this: Screenshot3 (look at the top left corner in
 Scr3) but I expected this: Screenshot4 (look at the bottom left corner
 of Scr4).
 
 I hope, that this is enough as an example. If this is expected
 behaviour, please let me know, but if it's not I hope the bug will be
 easily fixed.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Lyubomir

 The biggest problem here is that the keybindings are implemented at
 two layers of the system and the lower layer has access to state that
 makes it possible to implement the shift-based movement keys, but the
 upper layer is where shift-home is implemented. So I'll fix that (and
 there are lots of other keybindings that are wrong a manner similar to
 what you describe for shift-home and shift-end).
 
 Meanwhile, I would expect that, in step 3, to get something different.
 First: did you mean shift home? Assuming so, I would think that the
 home key would decide to try to include the "(defi" from the beginning
 of the selection, ie to try to include the line starting from the
 beginning of the selection. Thus you'd end up with only the "(defi"
 selected (because, back in step 1, you started with the insertion
 point between the "i" and the "n" and did shift-down).
 
 That is, you'd get the  same thing as if you used shift-up and
 shift-left to get to the beginning of the first line, not the
 beginning of the last line.
 
 Do you agree? If not, how does DrRacket know you mean the beginning of
 the last line instead of the beginning of the first line? (Or am I
 missing something more fundamental?)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Hi, 
 What I expected from the code editor is, that it should behave like any other text editor - notepad, ultraEdit and so on. For example if you select one row, you can deselect it by holding down shift and pressing home, and again select the whole row by holding down shift and pressing end button. 
 Of course the selection performed at step 3 could be changed to something more "racket" specific - for example holding down shift and pressing end will trigger a selection of the code between the corresponding brackets (for ex. 4th opening and 4th closing bracket); or holding down shift and pressing end will deselect the code between corresponding brackets. I'll leave the implementation to you, as I'm sure you'll come with a good idea.

 Ah. Thanks for pointing me to Notepad. It looks like they have a
 different notion of the internal state relating to the shift-movement
 keys than we do. Theirs seems better, so I'll look into adjusting ours
 to match.

 The different state seems to be a single position only, not a range
 with the invariant that that single position is always at one end or
 the other of the selection.  (We have, iiuc, a range that is only
 guaranteed to be inside the selection.)
 
 This affects all kinds of things like clicking and dragging, for example.

 I've just pushed a fix to the git repo. There should be a new nightly
 build tomorrow if you want to give this a try and see if I've gotten
 it right now.
 
 And thanks for your patience.

 Oh -- and here's the link for the nightly builds:
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 You'll see that, at the moment, it says it was updated early this
 morning. You'll need one that has been updated sometime later than
 now.
