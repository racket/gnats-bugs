>Description:
Thanks to Lu Zhao in my class, we now have a way
to trigger an elusive bug...
>How-To-Repeat:
Under Unix (haven't tried Mac OS X or Windows):

 1. Delete ~/.plt-scheme

 2. Start Drscheme (no language is selected)

 3. Open the "Choose Language..." dialog

 4. Select "Module"

 5. Click "Show Details". Notice that the panel doesn't
    appear.

 6. Click another language.

 7. Go back to "Module". The details panel now appears, but
    the collection-path control has no items in it
>Fix:
The bug was in the way that the language dialog settings panel was initialized. I had thought that the initial state of the GUI would be set in a particular way, but that wasn't actually how the code worked, so the GUI should be in a good state after it is constructed (ie, the result of the config-panel method is not called initially)
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 07 Feb 2009 10:07:42 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and checked in to SVN.

(I think.)

 Thanks! I think I've fixed this, but the little state machine that
 controls the language dialog is complex and distributed around in the
 code, so something else may have broken when I fixed it...
