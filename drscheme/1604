 I have fixed this -- please update scheme.ss in the framework collection
 (it is tagged) and try it out. 
 
 Along the way, I think that I found the cause of the inefficiency in the
 keystrokes! On my laptop it is a bit more noticable so I took out a
 superflous dynamic-wind and a let/ec (I suspect the first was the real
 problem) and typing seems to be a bit better.
 
 Let me know what you think.
