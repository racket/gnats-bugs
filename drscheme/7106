Subject: backtrace highlighting broken

>Release:        299.20-cvs29oct2004
>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
The source location information isn't quite correct in the backtrace window (i.e., that which you get after you click on the ladybug icon).  The filenames show up as #<void>, and the highlighting is one character off.  The numeric character positions appear to be correct if you count from 0.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a.ss and b.ss as follows:

(module a mzscheme
  (define (f x) (+ 3 x))
  
  (provide f))

(module b mzscheme
  
  (require "a.ss")
  
  (define (g x) (f (car x)))
  
  (provide g))

Then execute b.ss in the module language, and evaluate the following at the repl:

(g '(x y z))

Click on the ladybug; you'll get something like http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/misc/backtrace-error.png.

However, if you evaluate (g 3) instead, the error highlighting in the definitions window is correct.

Further, clicking on the dogeared document icon from the original error message, or on the source location information from the backtrace window, opens the correct file and highlights the correct region.
>Fix:
missed a case during porting -- fell thru a cond and got `void'
>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation; it could have been if falling off a cond
expression was a contract violation.
