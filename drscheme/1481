>Description:
A launcher created with DrScheme doesn't seem to ever exit.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Put 10 (or any simple expression) in the Definitions Window
Save Definitions
Create Launcher
Run the launcher; 10 will be displayed, and then MrEd will
  go to sleep. A Windows user will think that dismissing the
  stdio window shuts down MrEd, but it doesn't.

 Is it possible to do something so that closing the stdio window does exit mred? I would like to have the launchers exit whenever either:
 
 1) all windows are closed  -- if there was ever a window opened, or
 2) the stdio window is closed -- if there were no windows opened.

 If the stdio window is open, (exit) won't kill it. (The user will see
 "[Exited]" printed and further input is disallowed.)
 
 So I think all you need is 1.

 Ah, great! That's perfect. I think that I know how to implement one, by
 interposing on mred@. I forgot that I hadn't done that before the
 release. Thanks.

For now, we use polling to see if there are any windows open. If not,
exit. If so, don't.
