>Description:
The preferences file is locked (because the file C:\Documents and Settings\Dan\Application Data\PLT Scheme\_LOCKplt-prefs.ss exists), so your preference change could not be saved. Cancel preference change?

This error message pops up almost constantly, however have checked for the file it claims exists and it doesn't exist. I wouldn't mind so much except that I can't leave the error message up in the background because it requires me to pick "Try Again" or "Cancel" before I can go on with my program. Also, on startup this error message pops up a minimum of 20 times, and it makes me click cancel every time.
>How-To-Repeat:
Anytime I open the program or run what I have in the  definitions window or do pretty much anything I get this away message.

 Sounds like I should make the dialog only appear once ... but I don't
 know why you're not seeing the file. It really should be there.
 
 Can you evaluate this in DrScheme (in one of the "PLT" language levels)?
 
   (delete-file "C:\Documents and Settings\Dan\Application Data\PLT
 Scheme\_LOCKplt-prefs.ss")
 
 and tell us what it says?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
