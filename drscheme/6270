>Description:
I'm running Mandrake 9.0 on an Athon system, I downloaded mzscheme-204.src.unix.tar.gz from your site, then, following instructions,
in the plt/src directory, I ran configure (where my destination directory was /extra/mzscheme204 and I enabled dynlib), then make. That ran ok.

However, I got the following errors in "make install" during the .zo files creation stage. The following was scraped from the screen where the errors started occurring:

setup-plt: Compiling .zos used by Framework private
setup-plt:   in /extra/mzscheme204/collects/framework/private/

(etc, repeated many times).

At end the make install aborted w/ errorlevel 2.

./configure --prefix=/extra/mzscheme204 --enable-dynlib

 There seems to be something fishy about your installation. Some questions:
 
   - Are you sure that you only installed the mzscheme bundle? There
 shouldn't be any framework collection in that.
 
   - Are you sure that you don't have PLTHOME or PLTCOLLECTS environment
 variables set?
 
   - Did you install this over top of an old installation?

 That sounds like it could cause the problem you're seeing. The various
 plt packages aren't meant to co-exist -- drscheme completely subsumes
 mzscheme. If you want to keep separate versions around, it is possible
 (I certainly do it), but they should be in separate trees (ie,
 /extra/plt-202/... and /extra/plt-203/... etc).

 Glad I could help.
