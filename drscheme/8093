test coverage doesn't work right for multi-threaded programs.

Right now, if a function is called from a thread that isn't
the main thread, it just doesn't count as being called. Eg, in
this program:

(thread (lambda () (display "show this independently")))

the one lambda is never considered to be called.

 That was also present in callbacks.

 Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. 
 
 That is very unlikely to be the same bug (internally), since I know
 what causes this bug (technically, a design flaw) and it is very much
 multi-thread specific.

 If you use world.ss, then callbacks don't count as coverage.
