>Description:
A prefs file that refers to an installed-teachpack that's
no longer present results in a really perplexing hang: on
startup, it gets to the end of the progress bar, and (on 
Mac OS X), it stops "pulsing", indicating that it's done.
But then, nothing. Quit doesn't work, the splash is still 
there and can be moved but none of its green/yellow/red 
buttons work, basically the app is frozen. 

I spent a few minutes plowing through 
language-settings.rkt, but ... well, I ran out of steam.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open your racket prefs; on OS X it's org.racket-lang.prefs.rktd

2) Paste this s-exp:

(plt:framework-pref:drracket:language-settings ((-500 -500 1) (#6(#t constructor repeating-decimal #f #t none) #f ((lib "frongle-dongle.rkt" "installed-teachpacks")))))

**IMPORTANT NOTE** This ONLY WORKS if you DON'T have a
file named frongle-dongle.rkt among your installed
teachpacks. Don't forget! 

Start up drracket

See hang after progress bar has finished.
