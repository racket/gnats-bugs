>Description:
when pressing syntax highlight a message box with the 
message "vector-ref: expects type <vector> as 1st argument, given: #f; 
other arguments were: 9"
The error message box above the editing view prints out
"#<struct:object:gui.ss::3544>:49:1: read: expected a ')'"
drscheme GUI of that one window becomes unresponsible
>How-To-Repeat:
Hard to say, I just pressed that button trying to check my code

 Without a (hopfully small) example program, it is difficult for me to
 figure out what is going on. Can you help by making an example program
 for me?
 
 Thanks!

 I actually had a bug in my program as well. It shouldn't shoot out
 drscheme anyway. I'll try and reproduce it and send it to you.
