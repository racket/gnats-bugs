>Description:
I found two more things that go awry when rendering DrRacket in Ubuntu 11.10.  One seems critical one does not. 

(1) The title bar of the window displays 'untitled' instead of the active file name.
(2) The option to add teachpacks is not available until after a file has been loaded and run.  

I'm running 5.2.0.1--2011-10-17 on Ubuntu 11.10 with the Unity (Gnome3 based) desktop.  HP laptop with amd64 processor and ATI radeon card.
>How-To-Repeat:
- Start fresh instance of DrRacket where ISL+ (presumably any HtDP language) is the choosen language.  Go to Lanugage menu and you'll see that the only option is choose language.  
- The option will appear if
  -- you save the definitions window as a file
  -- you load an isl+ (maybe *sl) file and run it.

Perhaps this is working as indented to avoid teachpacks leaking into non *sl programs?  In which case it might be nice to have the teachpack option if the choosen language is *sl but the definitions window is still contains an unsaved file.  

Bug (1) should be obvious once you're working with only named/saved files.

 I'm unable to reproduce part (1) here on my machines with Ubuntu
 11.10.  Can you give precise reproduction instructions?

 I can no longer duplicate this bug using a build of 5.2.0.1 from early
 November. I think a previously push fixed related to the other
 menu-bar area bugs must have fixed it.

 This behavior isn't related to saving, it's related to what language
 the last program was "Run" in.
 
 I'll let Robby decide if he thinks that behavior should change.

 I do not see this behavior. I think that maybe there is a lower-level
 menu-related bug here.
 
 The intended behavior (and the behavior I see under mac os x) is that the
 language-that-will-be-used-when-Run-is-next-clicked is the language that
 also controls how the "Add Teachpack" menu item behaves. So, if I set the
 language to ISL+, quit DrRacket, start it again, and then select "Add
 Teachpack.." I get the expected dialog, namely one containing the
 teachpacks and asking me to choose.
 
 I'll also note that that the "Add Teachpack" menu should never be greyed
 out; it should either open a dialog to select a teachpack, or it should
 open a dialog box to say that you need to change the language.
 
 Robby

 I also see the behavior that Robby describes under Linux.  So it seems
 like something specific to the reporter's system is happening to the
 menu.
