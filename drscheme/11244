>Description:
I've noted that the word autocompletion feature in the DrRacket GUI only seems to provide words that are defined by Racket (that is, "function autocompletion"), not the strings that the user has used in his/her own file. It would be more useful if the file being worked on could be parsed so that the strings it contains would be included in the list. Currently, the autocompletion feature is basically equivalent to a "Search manuals" search in Help Desk (though it's nice to be able to avoid a few extra clicks and keystrokes to get there, and to constrain matches to word prefixes). It would be much nicer if it could serve as a quick way to refer to variables and function names that one has already defined elsewhere in the file.

If this is implemented, please make sure not to include the phrase the user is currently typing (that is, the one leading up to the cursor) in the possibilities.
