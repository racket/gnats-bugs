>Description:
The function to comment out the currently selected lines places
comments against the left margin (column 1) this causes problems
when using the auto-alignement (meta-I) feature because once it
is used, the commented code is indented using the first charecter
on the line which is on the left. the code the hence intented
twice as much as it should be. i think that the comment feature
should place the comments on the column of the left most charecter
in the selected code lines
>How-To-Repeat:
use the program
(define foo
  (lambda (bar)
    (+ 1
       (+ 1
          (+ bar)))))
then use the comment feature to replace the middle line like so
(define foo
  (lambda (bar)
    (+ 1
;       (+ 1
       (+ 2
          (+ bar)))))
now use alignment feature (meta-I) to align your code
automatically and you get this
(define foo
  (lambda (bar)
    (+ 1
       ;        (+ 1
       (+ 2
          (+ bar)))))
the auto comment feature should actually produce
(define foo
  (lambda (bar)
    (+ 1
       ;(+ 1
       (+ 2
          (+ bar)))))
which is not effected negativly by the auto indent
