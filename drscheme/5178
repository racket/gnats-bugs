 This used to work the way Pablito wants (ie, "(a)(b)" used to show up).
 
 Is this something that I need to fix from Scheme?

 Did you recently add the `[begin,end]-edit-sequence' to `remove-sexp'
 in scheme.ss? That's preventing a "kill streak" that results in
 appended kills.

 Yeah, I did -- I noticed some flashing when I tried that, but looking
 at the code, I don't know why there would have been flashing.
