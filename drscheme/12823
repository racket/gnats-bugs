>Description:
I've delayed submitting this PR for ages, because I think 
the solution is probably as simple as adding a
begin-edit-sequence / end-edit-sequence pair, but at 
this point I'm giving up and PR-ifying it.

the "undo" operation only undoes half of an insert-bracket-pair.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) In Preferences>Editing>General, check the "Enable Automatic Parentheses" box.

2) In a racket buffer, type shift-9. See a pair of parens, with the cursor in the middle.
3) Now, hit cmd-z, a.k.a. "undo". The left paren disappears, but the right paren remains.
