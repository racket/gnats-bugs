 It seems to either higlight the place in the drscheme window (in which
 case you can just look at the little line/col indicator in the bottom
 of the screen) or it does print the line/column numbers.
 
 Perhaps you can be more specific -- maybe you found a bug?

 It does highlight the error correctly, but I'd rather not have to
 remember the line/column. Not a bug just a feature request, I'd like
 it to print the line/column before the error message.
 
 In a case where the error is caused by another spot in the code
 (e.g. a missed declaration), I have to search back to find the wrong
 declaration and usually search forward to the spot noted by
 check-syntax just to make sure they are in sync. In emacs, I just set
 a marker or bookmark to error spots and can jump around quickly.
 Without markers or bookmarks, the line/column would give me an
 approximate idea where the error was.  Another idea would be having
 the buffer to jump to the error upon clicking the error message pane.
 
 Also could check-syntax report more than one error at a time? E.g. If
 I have two unbound variables in a buffer, only the first is
 reported. Thanks - EA
