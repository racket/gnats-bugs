>Description:
send: no such method: insert-return for class: text%

is the error message received when I try to work within
a textbox that remains after uncommenting a enclosing box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create text, enclose it with box.  Enclose text 
within that box so that there is now a box of text 
within a box of text.  Uncomment out the first box, 
so that the second box is the one remaing.

Problem goes away by uncommenting that box and enclosing 
it with a fresh box.

   I'm having trouble reproducing the problem. Can you verify that you
 see the problem when you start from a fresh drscheme? (you may need to
 save and close and open a file to see the problem?) Also, can you tell
 me precisely the names of the menus that you use? There is more than
 one way to add a box in drscheme.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Matthew, can you reproduce this problem? I can't make it happen under
 macos x. Perhaps you can try when you get home under windows?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
