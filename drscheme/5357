State-Changed-Why:
    fixed and released (some time ago, but forgot to
    close the PR)
    the bug: an exception was being raised during
    an edit sequence and the end-edit-sequence was
    being skipped
    
    perhaps there should be a contract saying that at
    the end of an event, there should be no unfinished
    edit-sequences.
