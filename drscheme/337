>Description:
The check-syntax feature does not always highlight or color all bound
variables.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following short program in the definitions window of DrScheme,
and do a check syntax.  The last placeholder in the program ("right") will
not be highlighted as a bound variable -- in fact, it won't be highlighted
at all.  Pointing at this "right", or its corresponding binding
occurrence, will not produce an arrow.

(define-struct NumTree-barren (num))
(define-struct NumTree-fruitful (num lchild rchild))

(define make-tree-function
  (lambda (base combine)
    (lambda (nt)
      (cond
        [(NumTree-barren? nt) (base (NumTree-barren-num nt))]
        [else (combine (NumTree-fruitful-num nt)
                       ((make-tree-function base combine)
                        (NumTree-fruitful-lchild nt))
                       ((make-tree-function base combine)
                        (NumTree-fruitful-rchild nt)))]))))

(define tree-member-22?
  (make-tree-function (lambda (base) (= base 22))
                      (lambda (num left right)
                        (or (= num 22) left right))))  ;; this right

State-Changed-When: Thu Jul  9 20:45:11 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Robby won't respond and say why this is my problem, and even if it is
it's probably the same as the other Check Syntax-related issues (22,
216, 240).
Responsible changed from "shriram" to "robby" by robby at Fri, 11 Mar 2005 17:35:28 -0500
Reason>>> rbf. Not sure why this was listed as SK's bug; sorry if I did that.

State changed from "suspended" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 11 Mar 2005 17:35:28 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released.
