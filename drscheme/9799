>Description:
One and a half things:

* It would be nice if S-return would jump to the previous match
  (I think that FF is doing this, but in general shift is expected
  to reverse directions of such things)

* The second one was harder to describe... but then I tried turning
  on the anchor search option, and I think that it now behaves in a
  very good way (my concen went away, and I don't think that it ever
  jumps in a disorienting way now).  So how about trying to make it
  default to being on in 4.1.1?  We'll have another release in the
  not too distant future anyway, so it can be turned off then if it
  turns out to be some disaster for most people...

 I don't want to turn on the jumping search as a default. I'm willing
 to listen to arguments, tho.

 Well, IIRC, the main argument against having it on is a potentially
 confusing jump -- and I don't think that it's doing that now (with the
 anchored search option on).
 
 (But my main feature request was for the S-return thing...  So feel
 free to drop this, or poll the plt-scheme list, or whatever.  In any
 case, it looks to me like additional small tweaks might happen still.)
 
 BTW, some more notes (which I'm fine if you ignore them for now in the
 same way):
 
 * C-enter is confusing because there is no visual indication that you
   typed a newline: you almost always see a red box with no text, which
   looks like a bug.
 
 * tab is not doing anything, which I'm not sure is intentional
 
 * A possible tweak is to use tab to go back to the text wherever you
   are (like escape is doing now), and have escape go back to the
   anchor.  This way you can always conveniently escape your way back
   to where you started.
 
 * A variant of this tweak is to use the arrow keys to break out of the
   search box, so it resembles isearch in Emacs.

 It does this now.

 I thought about that myself, and I think saving the extra space so not
 scrollbar is visible is the right thing, but maybe you have another
 alternative?

 It switches between search and replace, which is confusing when
 replace isn't visible, I suppose.

 <menukey>-f does that (assuming I'm understanding you correctly)

 I think that would be a bad idea. As much as possible, I want to make
 sure the usual editing keys edit in the usual ways. A power user might
 like that one, but I think the ordinary user would get confused.
