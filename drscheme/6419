>Description:
When you paste text with formatting (for example, from the DrScheme standard-error port) into the "Find" edit field, it retains the text formatting.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a new window in DrScheme.
2. Type the following into the definitions window:

   (error 'foo "bar")

3. Execute.
4. In the interactions window, select and copy the word "bar" (which should be in red italics).
5. Open the "Find" window/dock.
6. Paste the word into the find edit field. It appears in red italics.
7. Now select the edit field and replace the text by typing something else. It still appears in red italics.
