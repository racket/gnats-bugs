>Description:
I am trying to use the draw.ss teachpack on a Linux system.
I've tried both version 102 and 103, and had the same problem.

The procedures for making and accessing positions: make-posn,
etc. appear to be missing!

Without them, the teachpack is useless.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start up DrScheme and select "Add Teachpack..." then
add the draw.ss teachpack which (in Linux world) is in
the hdtp folder.

2.  Click execute to get an interaction window with draw.ss
loaded.

3.  Type in anything referring to make-posn.

 The screen dumps in our book have been produced with Linux 103 DrScheme 
 and teachpacks. 
 
 What language level are you using? Teachpacks are only supplied for the
 teaching language levels. If your students use Full Scheme, they can't
 use teachpacks.
