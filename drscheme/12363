>Description:
(This may happen with other #lang languages that trigger different buttons for DrRacket.)

I opened a file starting with "#lang htdp/bsl" and got two buttons for Check Syntax, and one Step and Macro Step (7 buttons in total).
See http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/3218/drracket.png

If we change from "Determine language from source" to "Beginning Student Language" we get 5 buttons and back to "Determine language from source" only 2 buttons.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file with the inflate balloon example from Racket's homepage:

#lang htdp/bsl ; Any key inflates the balloon
(require 2htdp/image) (require 2htdp/universe)
(define (balloon b) (circle b "solid" "red"))
(define (blow-up b k) (+ b 5))
(define (deflate b) (max (- b 1) 1))
(big-bang 50 (on-key blow-up) (on-tick deflate)
          (to-draw balloon 200 200))

Load it in DrRacket, making sure it is set to "Determine language from source" and see that the interface is showing more buttons than it should.

When "Beginning Student Language" is chosen, we get only 4 buttons: Step, Check Syntax, Run and Stop.

If we choose again "Determine language from source", the first two buttons disappear, leaving us with only Run and Stop. Running the file doesn't help making the buttons reappear.

 Hello,
 
 I just observed that this bug is still current.
 
 - There are 2 "Check Syntax" buttons that work as expected (though, there
 should be only one?!).
 - The "Debug", "Macro Stepper", "Run" and "Stop" buttons work.
 - The "Step" button brings a cmd console and an error dialog (as seen in
 the screenshot).
 
 I made two new screenshots with the new icons and the Step error:

 Looks like bug 11705 is similar to this as well.

 I'm not seeing this behavior anymore, or that described in 11705. Are you
 still seeing it?
