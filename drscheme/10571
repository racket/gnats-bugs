>Description:
I do not know if this is a "bug" or "functions as designed".  In "white on black" mode selecting a region of text with the mouse (for a copy/paste operation) does not highlight the text region in "inverted" mode as it does in black on white color mode.  The highlight background stays black and the selected test becomes red-ish.  This is visible, if mildly unexpected (and I might come to like it)... but if you try to select the already red text of an error message in the ineractive panel you can't see what you have selected.  If there is a way to set the highlight color/style in the preferences I did not see it.  I see that I can change the color of the error messages; that is a viable solution; but I like red error messages:)
>How-To-Repeat:
Set pref white on black color style.
Type an error in the interactive panel.
Try to select the red error message with the mouse.

 While I certainly agree that this is a problem, the best I can offer
 you is to set your highlight color at the OS level (go to System
 Preferences in the Apple menu, and then select Appearance and fiddle
 with the Highlight Color drop down menu).
