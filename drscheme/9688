>Description:
Text selections made via the "Find" button (as opposed
to the Edit/Find Again menu item) are not highlighted
visibly.  Likewise, the subsequent selection of the next
match by the "Replace & Find" button is not visibly highlighted.
>How-To-Repeat:
Win XP SP2
1. Start a fresh DrScheme.
2. In the defns pane, type "one two three four five
 six seven"
3. Ctrl+f to go to the Find field
4. Type "three" - you'll see the proper purple oval
 appear in the defns pane
5. Without keyboard focus leaving rhe Find field, type
 Ctrl+g.  You'll see the light tan, indicative of
 selection in a text control that doesn't have focus.
6. Click with mouse back into the defns pane to clear
 the selection and give the pane focus
7. Now click the Find button.  It won't draw any text
 selection, either light tan or blue.
8. Pull down the Edit menu. All the Replace menu items
 are enabled, because in fact the text is selected --
 just invisibly so.
9. You can prove the selection by mousing into the
 Replace field, typing "baz" or some such, and pressing
 the Replace button.  The invisibly selected "three"
 will be replaced with "baz."

 Hi -- I finally had a chance to look into this, and when I get to step
 7, I see the selection highlighting on the word "three". I'm using the
 SVN version that is slightly newer than what you use, but I wonder if
 maybe there was another step in there or something that I'm just
 missing? Do those steps, exactly as described in your PR still cause
 failures for you?

 Strange. (Without the preference setting, the steps would fail
 earlier, I expect.)
 
 In step 7, it should just be setting the ordinary selection, just as
 if you'd clicked and dragged the mouse, right?
 
 I'll try in 4.1 on the off chance that it's already fixed.

 Ah. I see what's happening now. I didn't follow the steps well enough
 (excellent steps, btw).
 
 The problem is that the focus is set to the button after clicking on
 it, instead of staying in the definitions window.
 
 I expect that this focus-following behavior is the standard behavior
 under windows so I'm not sure if I should change it. Opinions?

 Yes, I believe that's the problem.
 
 What I expected was to see the text highlighted as it was in step 5.  
 Note that in that step, too, the input focus is not in the definitions 
 window.  MrEd thus takes it upon itself to paint the 
 selected-but-without-focus text in a color different from that of 
 selection+focus.  I think that's a good thing, and that's what I wanted 
 to see in 7.
 
 Having the focus follow the mouse to the clicked control is indeed 
 standard Windows dialog behavior.  You certainly wouldn't want to 
 override that if you were in a standard-behavior dialog that you 
 expected to be driven by Accessibility or Automation type aids, which 
 might expect to navigate to a control via tabbing, then activate it with 
 key events.  I think you /could/ reasonably reset the focus in DrScheme, 
 though, since there are other ways to automate - and this isn't a 
 tab-driven dialog, anyway.

 Oh, okay. I've fixed that in my local copy, but I can't check in yet,
 since there are other changes I've not yet finished.

 What I coudl do is force the focus back to the definitions window when
 you click "find", but I suspect that's not what most windows users
 would expect, so if it is okay with you, I'll leave it alone.
