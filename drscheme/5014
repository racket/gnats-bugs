>Description:
The module language tries to declare a module using
the name specified in the source (= the suffixless file
name, if any).

If that name happens to be the name of a built in module
--- such as `mzscheme' --- the code doesn't execute.

(This problem shows up when I try to implement the module
that provides content for the MzScheme package web page.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Put

 (module mzscheme mzscheme 10)

in a file "mzscheme.ss", and try to execute it in DrScheme's
"module" language.

 do you think that I should be setting the current-module-name-prefix
 parameter?
