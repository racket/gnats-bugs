>Description:
When creating a MrEd launcher, the intermediate
values get shown in a stdout window.
This is like what DrScheme does, of course,
but it's not what I'd expect from a launcher.

Also, if you (close-output-port (current-output-port)), the values will
print in drscheme, but generate an error in the launcher. - pablito
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter a program like:

42
33
99
'hut 'hut

Create a Windows launcher.  Run it.
You'll see a stdout window with these
values.  Yuck.
