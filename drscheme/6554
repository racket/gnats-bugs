>Description:
When I start up DrScheme and execute the following code:

(define-syntax (bug stx)
  (let loop ((s stx))
    (printf "~a~n" s)
    (let ((l (syntax-e s)))
      (if (pair? l)
          (map loop l))))
  #'1)

(bug (lambda (x y) '(1 2)))

I get a DrScheme Internal Error box that says

sequence-contract-violation: negative: method insert cannot be called, except in states (unlocked), current state: flow-lock
>How-To-Repeat:
See description. Reducing the expression passed to the bug
macro makes the error happen much less reliably, but it 
still happens occasionally when I use (lambda (x y) '(1)).

 As I've reported before, I get this error ~1/day, usually while a 
 search in Help Desk is in progress.  Glad to see a more reliable method 
 of reproducing it.

 Okay, let me weaken my statement: I'm getting the same error message.

 okey dokey.

 ps: is it deliberate that you're not cc:'ing bugs@plt-scheme.org?  If 
 so, I'll stop re-adding it to the cc: list.
