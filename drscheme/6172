>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start Help Desk from DrScheme menu, using external Web
   browser.
2. Click "Show manuals".
3. Click "refresh all manuals".
4. Wait while it runs.  On my system, after displaying
   "Installing PLT MrEd: Graphical Toolbox Manual", the
   "Stop" button will gray, and DrScheme window will
   disappear from screen.  Apparently the "mred" process
   terminated.
