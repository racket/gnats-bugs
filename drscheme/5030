 Do you mean the light blue area of the contour window? If you scroll
 around, does it get bigger after that?

 Yes.  As soon as the window scrolls, the blue box jumps to the correct size.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    the original problem of this pr seems to work
    fine for me under unix, so I suspect a macos problem.
    
    I did notice another problem, which is now fixed.
    When the definitions window is hidden completely,
    the blue highlighted region disappears, now.
