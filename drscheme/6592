>Description:
After using the DrScheme editor for a while, I believe if would be
nice to have the paren-region highlight/selection behavior tweaked
in the following, or similar ways:

- make flash matching paren and the region-highlght the same selectable
color, ideally defaulting to a color not similar to the text region
selection color (possilby yellow for example, as a grey is typically
too easily visually confused with the text region selection color which
also typically defaults to some shade of grey, which makes it difficult
to tell if a region is selected for editing, or simply just highlighted).

- make paren region-highlight modal, such that:
  - the mode is initially unhighted/unselected for newly opened editors/files.
  - a single click at an exiting unhighted/unselected matching paren location,
    or the entry of a new matching paren charactor, highlightes and/or flashes
    the paren region; or unhights a previously highlighted/selected paren region.
  - a doulbe click at exiting matching paren locations selects that paren region
    for editing.
  - a triple click at matching paren locations selects the paren region's
    content (minus the enclosing parens) for editing.

- corespondingly:
  - a single click at a non-matching paren locations will place the cursor
    at that locatoin, or select the charactor for editing, depending on the
    click position within the displayed text (as it is today).
  - a double click at a non-matching paren location will select the word
    and/or leading white-space depending on the click position (as it is today).
  - a triple click within a matching paren region selects that paren region's
    content (minus the matching parents for editing, as above.

- and possibly if the shift (or possibly some other more reasonable) key is
held down during a single click on a paren of a highlighted paren-region,
the cursor is placed at the mateing matching paren position, and the window
scrolled if nessisary (like happens for flashing matching parens, but remains
at at that new position with the region remaing highted, such that if the
mouse is shift-clicked again, the cursor and window reverts as it was to the
previous matching paren and scroll position; which I suspect is often nice
when editing large modules/functions rather than having the matching parens
only temporarilty flash to their counter part positions, or having to scroll
back and forth.)

Although I know its easier to write a request than implmenent it, thanks
for the opportunity to voice my 2-cents.

 another desire/request:
 
 - it would be nice if selections were extended using the same mode which
 initially selected the present item, i.e. If a word was selected by a double
 click if the mouse button remains pressed at the end of the second click the
 word selection is extendable on successive word boundaries as the mouse is
 dragged. Correspondingly if a paren-region (inclusive or exclusive of the
 bounding parens) is selected with a double or triple click, an enclosed
 sub-paren-region or a surrounding paren-region may be selected by dragging
 the mouse then releasing when the desired region is selected.
 
 Thanks again, -paul-

 Hi Paul,
 
   Thanks for the comments, as always.
 
 I'm not sure that we'll get to all of these, but let me just point out
 some keyboard shortcuts that you may be interested in:
 
   alt-{left,right,up,down} move according to the parenthesis structure
   in your program.
 
   alt-shift-{left,right,up,down} move like the alt-varieties, but also
   select that region (adding "shift" to all kinds of keyboard movement
   also does selection)
 
   esc-control-k cuts to the matching parenthesis in front of the
   insertion point.
 
   esc-control-t transposes the two (paren matching) expressions around
   the current insertion point.
 
 Apologies if you already know about these.
 
 Robby

 Thank you, was familiar with them, but for some reason (likely simply
 personal habit/preference) I'm most comfortable navigating text/code with
 a mouse/trackpad, as I never became proficient with emacs etc. style text
 navigation.

should have a wishing well category?  Stuff that can stay 
there indefinitely until someone fill like digging up some 
wishes and implementing them?

 We used to have a `change-request' designation (the choices were "bug"
 "docs-bug" and "change-request" iirc)
