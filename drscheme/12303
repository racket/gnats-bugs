>Description:
I've just upgraded to ubuntu 11.10.  Almost everything works, but I get the following strange behavior:

When I scroll the window by dragging the scrollbar, the location of the horizontal line below the #lang line sometimes lags, so that the #lang line area appears to take up half or more of the screen (or some smaller area that's still bigger than usual).  This flickers while dragging, and then goes to the correct location when I stop dragging.

I can't make this hapen with the arrow keys, or PgUp/PgDn.
