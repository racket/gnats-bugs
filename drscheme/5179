 > lib loading line can't be copied
 
 The new Help Desk uses Your Favorite Browser, where you should easily be
 able to copy the text.
 
 I've managed to emulate the current Help Desk behavior, where the lib
 loading line appears at the top, by using frames.
 
 I hope to have the new HD ready just after v200 is out.
