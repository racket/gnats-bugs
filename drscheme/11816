>Description:
When DrRacket is open, and I open a Racket file through means other than the "Open..." command in DrRacket (by double-clicking, by a browser-triggered open command, or by a command-line "open" command), DrRacket fails to react--it doesn't open the file.  I open several files, and wait for a long time, and it still doesn't open the files (though it otherwise responds normally as I edit the files I already have open).  I open the "Open..." dialog and close it, and suddenly the files all open.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a Mac (perhaps it is important that this is 64-bit Racket built from git source), create a file, "thing.rkt".

Ensure that DrRacket is already open, and then have the system open "thing.rkt" with DrRacket.  This can be accomplished either by graphically setting .rkt files to open with DrRacket (select the file in Finder, command-I to bring up file info, set the "Open with..." thing to be DrRacket, and, optionally, "Change all...") and then double-clicking on thing.rkt, or by, e.g., "open -a /Applications/Racket/DrRacket.app thing.rkt".  I expect the file to fail to load.

 Can someone who was able to reproduce this bug on their mac try with a
 recent (as in, last couple days) build?

 This happens to me on an intermittent basis on the Mac. I was told to ignore because it is a long-standing problem with the Mac.

 Have you seen it happen with a very recent build? I pushed a change
 that might address the problem, but since I haven't been able to
 replicate the problem consistently enough on my machine, I'm not sure
 that the change helps.

 I haven't seen it in recent memory, nor have I been able to reproduce it
 with the most recent build.  On the other hand, I also haven't been able to
 reproduce it with an old v5.1 release build, so maybe annoying
 nondeterministic things are part of the cause...
 
 Meanwhile, trying just now, I have been able to reliably produce
 *this*somewhat similar behavior (which could go in a bug report of its
 own) in a
 just-built-from-git Racket: Ensure DrRacket is not open, then open some
 file (thing.rkt) that opens with DrRacket, and switch to a different
 application while the splash screen is still there.  DrRacket will simply
 open a blank document and will not open the file.
 
 *This* bug is present in v5.1 onward as far as I can tell, but not in
 v5.0.1.

 I did a build from the git repository last night and cannot reproduce
 this behavior any more -- I used to be able to reproduce it fairly
 consistently and reliably.

 Thanks!  I'll close the bug.
 
 John, can you open a new bug for the problem you just reported?

 &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; *** Description:<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; When DrRacket is open, and I open a Racket file through means =
 other than the &quot;Open...&quot; command in DrRacket (by double-clicking,=
  by a browser-triggered open command, or by a command-line &quot;open&quot;=
  command), DrRacket fails to react--it doesn&#39;t open the file. =A0I open=
  several files, and wait for a long time, and it still doesn&#39;t open the=
  files (though it otherwise responds normally as I edit the files I already=
  have open). =A0I open the &quot;Open...&quot; dialog and close it, and sud=
 denly the files all open.<br>
 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; *** How to repeat:<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; On a Mac (perhaps it is important that this is 64-bit Racket b=
 uilt from git source), create a file, &quot;thing.rkt&quot;.<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Ensure that DrRacket is already open, and then have the system=
  open &quot;thing.rkt&quot; with DrRacket. =A0This can be accomplished eith=
 er by graphically setting .rkt files to open with DrRacket (select the file=
  in Finder, command-I to bring up file info, set the &quot;Open with...&quo=
 t; thing to be DrRacket, and, optionally, &quot;Change all...&quot;) and th=
 en double-clicking on thing.rkt, or by, e.g., &quot;open -a /Applications/R=
 acket/DrRacket.app thing.rkt&quot;. =A0I expect the file to fail to load.<b=
