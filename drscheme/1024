 It hilites (empty? (x) 10) for me.
 
 Is any error ever hilited? If not, I'll bet your have a 256-color
 monitor, and the new pink shading for errors isn't in your colormap.
 [But then I imagine you'd submit a more general bug report in that
 case. If the above expression is a special case, I'm stumped for the
 moment.]
 
 Anyway, a fine bug report for number 2^10. :)

 I observed a pink hilite yesterday or so. But since I don't make mistakes,
 I haven't paid attention :-)
 
 I will check.

 Sh.t 
 
   Welcome to DrScheme, version 100/39d13.
   Language: Beginner.

 I started DrS over. And yes, it now hilites and it is all about a stupid
 color monitor. Frustrating.
