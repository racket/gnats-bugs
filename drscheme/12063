>Description:
During PBD lab: I'm observing that the paren highlighting feature appears to break on programs that have a large number of graphical snips, including comment boxes.  What happens is that, at a certain point, the highlighting no longer happens.  If one then goes to the preference panel, and unclick-and-click the paren highlighting checkbox, then that seems to recover the paren highlighting.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, I haven't found the exact trigger for this problem.  The teacher who encountered this was editing code with a large number of comment snips.
>Fix:
