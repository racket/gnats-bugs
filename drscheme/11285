With the program below, I set the details of the language dialog
to "syntactic test suite coverage".  Run, save, quit.  When I start
drracket again on the saved file, the dialog shows "debugging" as
the selected option -- but running the code shows the colors for the
coverage setting, so it looks like the setting is right, but the gui
is showing the default choice.

 It *might* be (but I'm not sure, since I'm hacking other parts of drr)
 that this shows only when I start it with a file as a command-line
 argument.
