>Description:
When the preferences file contains a "bad" percentage ratio
between top & bottom windows, DrS won't start up.
>How-To-Repeat:
(per private communication)

It is difficult to repeat, other than by manually putting bad values in the preferences file, 
as far as I can tell.
>Fix:
The relative percentages saved in the preferences
file when a window is closed might not be 
correct for the next window that is opened.

There are only one place I can imagine this happening:
- the user creates a window on a big screen and
  sizes the percentages to some extreme.
- the user quits drscheme
- the user resizes the monitor to a smaller size
- the user restarts drscheme 

at this point, the saved percentages violate the minimum
sizes of the defs and interactions windows and
this raises an error as drs starts up.

I fixed it by checking for the error case and just
going with equal splits.

This was a contract violation. Without the contract
violation, the GUI would have been messed up,
probably making the PR submitted incomprehensible.
