The Find/Replace dialog has no ability to find or replace within selected text. This would be a very useful feature to have.

Platform is actually Mac OS X 10.4 on Intel, but the drop-down doesn't have an option for that.

 Can you describe this feature in a bit more detail?

 It usually works like this:
 
 - Highlight a section of text
 - Open Find/Replace dialog
 - Enter search text
 - Enter replacement text
 - Click "Replace all in selection"
 - All occurrences of search text within the selection are replaced by the
   replacement text
