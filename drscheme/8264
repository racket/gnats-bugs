>Description:
I am a student in a Computer Science class that uses Scheme, and ever since the teacher updated it to the latest beta, the program thinks that test cases are images, and whenever I run them, it returns set-bitmap in image-snip%: bad bitmap: (instantiate (class ...) ...)
Any help will be appreciated

Reason>>> Seems like drscheme assumes bitmap for test objects?

 No; it's just that the error message involves bitmaps (there are
 bitmaps in the test cases). But I'll take the pr.
