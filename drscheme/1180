 Do you know what the problem is here? I suspect that there is some
 support for this in help desk already, but is it tied into searching,
 or is there just some new macro that needs to be used for these kinds
 of links (there are lots of these in various manuals I maintain)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 See collects/help/helpwin.ss, line 250 or so:
 
   [on-url-click
     (lambda (k url)
       ;; Watch for clicks from docs to undownloaded docs
       ...
 
 I don't know why it didn't work for the MrSpidey link, though.

 It turns out that this problem is tracable to the fact that the url
 library's function combine-url/relative uses mzlib's normalize-path.
 Normalize-path actually involves the filesystem in it decisions, so
 symbolic links are followed and an exception may be raised if a
 directory does not exist in the filesystem. It seems wrong for
 combine-url/relative to be sensitive to the filesystem, even for file: urls.
