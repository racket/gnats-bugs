>Description:

In the "based on" section, can you include

  McMicMac (c) 1995-98 PLT, Rice University (Shriram Krishnamurthi)

please?  Thanks.

Also, you sometimes use "Copyright" and sometimes don't.  (Likewise
you are inconsistent about periods and authorship lists.)

The page also lists no explicit copyright for DrScheme itself, which
seems like an omission.
