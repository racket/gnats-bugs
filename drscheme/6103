>Description:
This PR covers two problems with the "Search in
Files..." dialog. I thought I'd submitted a PR on
these, but a search turns up nothing, so I'm going to
submit these again:

1) In the upper pane of the search results, the first
entry is italicized.  It appears that the intent is
that the italicized entry is the one that is displayed
in the window below.  However, clicking on one of these
entries changes the window below but not the italicized
highlight.

2) When the search results turn up nothing, the text
"Searching..." in the upper box never goes away.
>How-To-Repeat:
Problem 1) Using Search in Files, search for 
"contract.ss" in all files in the stepper collection. 
The results show up. Now click on one of the entries 
other than the first.  The lower pane changes, but
the first entry is still italicized.

Problem 2) In the Search in Files dialog, search for
the text "frobble-gobble" in the stepper collection.
The text "Searching..." in the upper window never 
goes away.

    fixed and released to cvs. 
    
    I also added something so that the open file button goes
    to the right place in the file, instead of just opening
    the file at the beginning like it used to do.
