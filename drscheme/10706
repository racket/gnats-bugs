>Description:
I've hit this twice in ever (~8 months of non-student use of DrScheme), and have no idea how to reproduce it.

The first time was with either 4.2 or 4.2.1 on Linux (I don't recall exactly when), and may not actually be the same bug as...

The second time was a few seconds ago. With some text in the "Description" field [1], I scrolled down, the clicked at the right of the bottom line. Voila! [2]
