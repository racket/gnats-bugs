>Description:
The fully-qualified file name is placed in the window bar when a file is renamed by the "Save As..." operation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new file.  Type a few characters.  Select "Save Definitions Window
As..." and save to a non-root directory.  The title of the window bar now 
contains the entire path to the file, rather than just the file name.

 This bug also affects the first file opened in DrScheme --- i.e., the

 "Untitled".
