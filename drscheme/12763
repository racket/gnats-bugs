>Description:
(This is unrelated to the other PR, I just figured that this would
be a good time to bring this up.)

This is something that repeatedly bugs me in class -- possibly because
I'm used to always set an option that removes all duplicates.  I often
have confusing interaction that look like:
 * <up><enter>, oops, this was the wrong item, I need to go further back
 * <up><up><enter>, this repeats the *same* wrong item, since it's now
   appearing in the last two entries...
 * At this point I switch to hitting <up> slowly and looking at each
   expression until I get to the right one.

It would be nice if there was an option for the current behavior, or
drop repeated items, or drop all repeated items so the history is
unique.  IOW, something like the `keep-duplicates' parameter from
`readline'.

Possibly related: use a straight preference for this (no
`plt:framework-pref:drracket' prefix), and have the same configuration
used in readline and in drracket.  I'll be happy to do the readline
side to a point where it can fit with the drracket defaults.  A nice
result of that is that we'll have a unified way to configure both the
drracket and the xrepl inputs.

 I have the same experiences. 
 
 The only thing that prevented me from suggestion 'uniqueness'
 is the possibility that you want to execute the same effect 
 twice in a row. Eventually I convinced myself that even that
 doesn't matter. So removing duplicates looks like the correct
 and convenient behavior.

 Adjacent duplicates get dropped, right? That is, if I do these commands:
 
   x
   y
   x
   x
 
 then I end up with:
 
   x
   y
   x
 
 in the history.

 I think that would be enough.
