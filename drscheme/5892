>Description:
In the Beginning Student teaching language,

Welcome to DrScheme, version 202.4-cvs10oct2002.
Language: Beginning Student.
> (define-struct posn (x y))
define-struct: cannot redefine name: make-posn

This error message is confusing to some students who interpret this as meaning "make-posn is broken". A better message might be something like: "cannot redefine structure: posn".
