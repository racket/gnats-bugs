Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 25 May 2007 05:01:03 -0400
Reason>>> Sounds like a focus issue, and I'm not sure if it's in
drscheme or mred.


Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Fri, 25 May 2007 09:08:42 -0400
Reason>>> I believe this is a problem with the guibuilder, something
that Matthew may have intended me to take over, but
something that I never did :)


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 25 Jul 2007 14:52:11 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in v370.6
