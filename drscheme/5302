>Description:
When HTML text containing the non-breaking-space character entity
("&nbsp;") is copied from the Help Desk and pasted into a Scheme
code file that is saved in text-only mode, the "&nbsp;" entities
are translated to character A0h, rather than to ASCII space
character 20h, in the Scheme file.

The A0h characters appear to be space characters visually, but
are not interpreted as spaces by various Scheme tools.

It may make sense to have text pastes into the DrScheme
Scheme file and REPL windows always map to 7-bit ASCII, or at least
map character 0ah to 20h.

(The HTML for Dybvig's book uses "&nbsp;" in all its examples of
Scheme code.  This problem was noticed then Check Syntax made all
of Dybvig's code bright red.)

   I'm skeptical that DrScheme should automatically translate 
 non-breaking spaces to space when pasting. It seems confusing, esp. 
 with you can use copy/paste in combination with find/replace to get 
 rid of the spaces quite easily.
 
 Perhaps when a copy happens in Help Desk is the right time to do this 
 translation?
 
 Any comments?

 Thanks for the bug report!
 
 As a work-around, you can combine copy/paste with the find/replace 
 feature of DrScheme to easily eliminate those non-breaking spaces.
