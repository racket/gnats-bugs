(reference-library "sig.ss" "mred") doesn't work in DrScheme
because sig.ss uses require-library on "refer.ss" instead
of reference-library.

How pervasive is this problem, and how can we fix it?

 I never understood the distinction between the two. Perhaps we can get rid
 of the broken one?

 I don't think we can get rid of the require-library procedure. This
 will require a group-wide discussion.
