>Description:
When using DrScheme with more than two tabs open, switching between two tabs that are not adjacent in the list, each time you return to a tab from one not adjacent to it, the visible portion of the document in the definitions area is offset from the portion that was visible the last time you were in that tab.

The offset value is constant for a given size window, and does not depend on whether the interactions pane is visible. 

My experiments have been with two different size windows.  When 24 lines are visible in the definitions pane, the offset is 10 lines.  When 40 lines are visible in the definitions pane, the offset is 16 lines.

Another interesting result is that the direction of the offset changes depending on the relative location of the two tabs.

For example, if there were four tabs open, and they were numbered as they appeared in the top pane from left to right as tabs 1,2,3, and 4...

If a user started in tab 4, switched to tab 1, then back to tab 4, the document in tab 4 would be offset downward from its original location (if line 100 was at the top of the viewable area before, some line greater than 100 would be at the top of the viewable area after)

If a user started in tab 1, switched to tab 4, then back to 1, the document in tab 1 would be offset upward from its original view (if line 100 was at the top of the viewable area before, some line less than 100 would be at the top of the viewable area after)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open up 4 tabs.  Tabs 1,3, and 4 should be documents that are larger than the viewable area in DrScheme (so they require scrolling)

2. Scroll down in tab 1 so that the viewable area is neither at the beginning nor the end of the document

3. Switch to tab 3 or tab 4

4. Switch back to tab 1.  Notice the scroll bar has changed.

4a. Notice that if you repeat step 3, but switch to tab 2 before returning to 1, the scroll bar is correct.
>Fix:
The bug was that the scrolling region was set before an end-container-sequence but ending the container sequence triggered scrolling. The fix was to swap the order.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor a type error.

 Wow, what a fantastic bug report! Thank you for that energy.
 
 I'm pretty sure that I won't be able to fix this for the upcoming 370
 release, but I hope to look into it shortly after it goes out the
 door.
 
 Thanks again,
 Robby

 This should be fixed in the latest SVN version of DrScheme.
 
 Thanks again for the great bug report.
