>Description:
The procedure read seems to be not working properly. The following hangs 
up the sysytem

(begin (display "prompt") (let* 
                            ((a (read)) (b (read)))
                            (+ a b)))

In fact, after breaking the computation, the Scheme is still in a 
pretty confused state, in that it refuses to read. I also tried to
evaluate (read) before binding to a and b, but it doesn't seem to work:

(begin (display "prompt")
       (let* ((a (eval (read)))   (b  (eval (read))))
       (+ a b))
I am trying to make my students to write a simple interactive program,
but it doesn't seem to be possible.  The above is a bit contrived, but
it illustrates the problem. 

Any help will be appreciated.

 Sorry for responding so slowly to this message! It seems to have gotten
 lost for quite a while in ether-land.
 
 In any case, read should be working correctly in DrScheme version 53. Is
 that what you experienced?
