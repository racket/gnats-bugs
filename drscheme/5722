>Description:
The "choose file" dialog that comes up after selecting "Create Executable..." seems to have the flags set to choose a directory (folder) instead of a file.  If the user tries to continue, an entire directory will be overwritten with the executable.
>How-To-Repeat:
Select "Create Executable...".  In the resulting dialog box, you cannot choose a file, only a folder.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    to clean up

State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  1 16:29:23 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    Later versions at least make the overwriting clear, and look
    for an ".app" suffix to help avoid disaster. A proper fix
    seems to require more from the OS X API
