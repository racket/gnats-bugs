>Description:
Under Windows 95 "\", normally obtainable with AltGr + \, doesn't work in DrScheme. There happens a kind of backspace, blocking further input from the keyboard. Only by clicking the mouse can one continue. Running MzScheme, of course in a Dos-window, does not give this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Opening DrScheme. In neither of both windows can one type "\".

 Dear Sirs,
                     Sorry if I made a mistake: my PC is a Thinkpad 310E, not
 a 3103.
                                                         Yours truly,
                                                         Harry Litzroth

 Does this mean that there is no way to type "\" on his keyboard 
 without the alt modifier being turned on?
 
 If so, it seems like one solution is to have an other preference that 
 turns off all of the emacs keybindings, leaving only menu-based 
 keybindings. Is there something better?

 Do you have a european keyboard? If so, you should try this:
 
    On European keyboards, the backslash character
    may not work properly in DrScheme.  If you
    experience this problem, comment out this line:
 
         (map-meta "\\" "remove-space")
 
    in PLTHOME/collects/framework/keymap.ss.
 
 Hope that helps!
 
 Robby

 Dear mister Robby Findler,
                                     Indeed, it works. Thank you very much.
 Without a backslash it was nearly impossible to do something serious.
                                                                     Thanks
 again.
                                                                      Truly
 yours,
                                                                       Harry
