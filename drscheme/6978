>Description:
The language selection dialog box doesn't display correctly after you hit the "Show Details" button; see <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/misc/language-dialog.pdf> for a screenshot of the problems.  Forcing DrScheme to redraw the screen by alt-tabbing to a window in front of DrScheme then back fixes the problem.

Additionally, it looks like this is related to the vertical resize that happens the first time you hit "Show Details".  Subsequent displays of the language selection dialog default to the taller size (enough to display all of the options) even if details are hidden; hitting "show details" then produces a correctly-drawn dialog.

And, of course, since this is MacOSX, s/dialog/sheet/, although I don't know how relevant this is.
