>Description:
I have a "test case" (my plot library) in which I can get DrRacket to consume 2GB in about an hour just by editing and running code normally. The reproduction steps below cause a slower leak.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Paste this program into an editor ("Tab #1"):

#lang racket

(time (collect-garbage)
      (collect-garbage))
(display (format "Memory used: ~aM~n" (round (/ (current-memory-use) (expt 1024 2)))))


2. Open a new tab ("Tab #2")

3. Switch to Tab #1; run the program

4. Many times: Switch to Tab #2, then back to Tab #1

6. Run the program


The time taken to collect garbage and the memory usage should both increase. The memory used seems to be unrecoverable (i.e. closing tabs and/or collecting garbage doesn't reclaim it).

 I tried the experiment suggested in the PR but instead of running the
 program to determine how much memory there (which requires a bunch of
 allocation to set up the user space and thus confuses the experiment)
 I just clicked on the memory use thing in the corner of drracket's
 window (submitting things to the REPL would also be better than
 hitting "Run"). I too saw what seemed to be a very small increase. So
 I tried to see what dump-memory-stats would say. The below is the
 before and after switching tabs many times (maybe 50 or so) and then
 clicking collect garbage many times to try to get to a fixed point.
 
 These dumps suggest that my reading of the memory use was actually
 wrong, tho, and there is no leak. Unless I'm reading them wrong?
 
 It would be good if someone who is more familiar with these dumps
 takes a second look.

 Were you using Ctrl-Tab to switch? I just collected some data that 
 suggests that *clicking on the tabs* causes the memory leak. It doesn't 
 even seem to require switching tabs.
 
 I've collected data for switching tabs with the keyboard, switching tabs 
 with the mouse, and NOT switching tabs, but just alternating between 
 clicking the open tab and clicking in the open editor.
 
 I've only kept data from dump-memory-stats that seemed to be increasing 
 appreciably.
 
 Don't look for increases in the first test. It's sort of like a control.
 
 For the other two, the most notable increases are in the memory use 
 indicator, # of installed finalizers, and # of immobile boxes.
 
 Last thing: because the memory leak apparently has to do with GUI event 
 handling or drawing, it might be platform-specific.

 Thanks! That's great. I see it too.
 
 It is kind of mysterious, tho, since tab-panel% itself doesn't seem to
 leak (program below) and yet the callback for clicking in DrRacket
 calls the exact same method that the callback for the menu calls (the
 change-to-nth-tab method).
 
 Well, there's still more threads to pull on here, but I wanted to at
 least ack this helpful exercise you've done.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 One more bit: I can see this happening under mac os x (and Neil is
 apparently using linux).

 And under windows, I do NOT see this happening. Maybe that's a clue
 (or maybe that's already obvious to someone who knows what is going on
 at that level).

 I re-tested this on a whim this morning, and couldn't duplicate it on 
 5.2 or the current master. Looks like it was fixed somehow. Robby, can 
 you verify that on the machine you've duplicated it on so we can close this?
