>Description:
(as in summary, preventing misc gui-windows from being
easily reselected if becomming obscured by the main editor
window.)

>How-To-Repeat:
add teachpack, convert-gui for example, enter:
> (convert-gui (lambda (x) x))
click on definition/interaction, bringing it to front,
likely hiding the convert-gui window; which has not
been entered in "windows" menu list, therefore not
being easily re-selectable.

 As with "Keybindings" window, which has the additional weirdness
 that the main window can't be selected by clicking within its content
 frame, but can be selected by clicking within the window's title bar.

Reason>>> I looked into making the user-program windows appear in the windows 
menu, and I don't think it is going to work with the current architecture.

Specifically, the main problem is that obtaining the name of the window in the 
user's program means running untrusted user code. While appropriate 
protections can be set up to protect DrRacket, the user program can observe 
that it is being queried and so programs will behave differently in DrRacket 
than in racket. Specifically, it will appear to the user's program that the get-
label method of the frame will be called at random times, without the 
program even having any calls to the method in it.

So, for that reason, I think I'll just close this PR.

(This could all change if there becomes a way for DrRacket to get the frame's 
label without invoking user code, but I'm not sure if that's in our future or 
not.)
