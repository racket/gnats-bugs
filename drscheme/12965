>Description:
The following program produces odd output when run in DrRacket:

    #lang scribble/lncs
    
    @(if 0)

First, the expected syntax error in `if` will show. However,
if you wait a few seconds the following error also appears:

  Module Language: invalid language specification in: scribble/lncs/lang

This does not happen when running the file using the `racket`
executable.

 I'm not seeing the behavior you're reporting. Does it still happen for
 you? If so, does it happen when the default preferences file? If not,
 any guesses as to what prefs are triggering the problem?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I tried it on the machine I reported the bug from again with the
 racket-prefs.rktd file deleted. This is on a 5.3.0.20 install that I
 just built.
 
 Oddly, I don't see this behavior on a different machine that's running
 the same Linux distribution. Same version, prefs file deleted.
 
 Anything else I should try?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Sorry, this was unclear. I still see the problematic behavior on
 pressing "Run".

 Well, I just tried under ubuntu with the git head and after removing
 the preferences file and I don't see the bad behavior.
 
 I do sometimes see a strange pause before the prompt appears, but
 usually only the first time I hit run. I haven't see the message about
 a bad language yet.
 
 Mysterious.
