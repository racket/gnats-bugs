>Description:
File(s) do not immediately open after they are dragged onto the DrRacket dock icon. Rather, the file(s) open after another file has been opened explicity through File->Open. This behaviour is observed both when DrRacket is aleady running, and when this action is used to start it. 

It seems like these events are being queued but only flushed after the explict open. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Drag a file onto the DrRacket dock icon.

 FWIW, I think you'll find that the second or third one will open and
 then all will open after that. (I only write this to point out a,
 perhaps, better workaround.)
