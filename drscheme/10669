>Description:
It would be nice to be able to choose 'R6RS' as a language in the dropdown menu in DrScheme. 

It would address one use case where R6RS developers choose not to use DrScheme because it would require them to use the #!r6rs declaration, which they won't do for some reasons.

 The general goal has been to require the use of language dialog less,
 rather than more, by allowing people to use the Module language and
 specify the language as part of the program.  The R6RS fortunately
 supports that, and it's a good idea. Having it as part of the language
 dialog would take the program out of the module system, making it
 harder to integrate with the rest of the system.  Programs developed
 that way couldn't be `require'd or `import'ed by other (even R6RS)
 programs.
 
 All that said, it would be easy to write a PLaneT package to provide
 such a language option, if you still want it.

 Well, with sufficient work, the language dialog's version of r6rs
 could be the same as the module language one, eihter by just inserting
 the prefix and going into the module language or using the teaching
 language's trick or probably some other way I didn't think of.
 
 That said, it is my understanding that #!r6rs is in the standard. Is that w=
 rong?

 I would like to write a plugin that would cause DrScheme to:
 1) Always evaluate the code as though it were in module mode and the
 file started with #!r6rs
 2) Only search for things in R6RS or SRFIs when this mode were enabled.
 
 Could you please point me in the right direction on getting started?

 I need to figure out how to do it without adding anything to the users code.

 It is not wrong. The thing is that some folks are put off by the need
 to add that line to run their R6RS code in PLT. If that is the only
 reason not to use DrScheme, then it is too bad.

 Start by looking at the docs here:
 http://docs.plt-scheme.org/tools/adding-languages.html
 
 However, this won't make things work, most of the time, in DrScheme.
 For example, say I develop an R6RS library (foo bar).  If I write that
 in your new language level, and then save it in the file "foo/bar.ss",
 (import (foo bar)) will give this error (provided that "foo" is a
 collects directory):
 
 ./sw/plt-trunk/collects/mred/private/snipfile.ss:221:19: load-handler:
 expected a `module' declaration for `bar' in
 #<path:/home/samth/sw/plt-trunk/collects/foo/bar.ss>, but found
 something else
 
 You would need to surreptitiously modify the file to insert #!r6rs to
 make it work right in PLT, but you've said you don't want to do that.

 Eli (cc'ed) is the right person to ask about the search.

 That would scare off the expected users.
 
 Thanks for the rest of the info!

 There are various hooks you can set that would probably make this
 work. Maybe current-load or one of its cousins is a place to start.
 (Note that you don't need to modify drscheme to test this -- if you
 can set those hooks in a good way to make loading code work in
 mzscheme, that's the first step).

 Are:
 
 13.2 	Evaluation and Compilation
 13.3 	The scheme/ load Language
 13.4 	Module Names and Loading
 
 The places I should start reading about how the runtime works?

 There is a way to do that, but it is bad, and will change in the very
 near future.  A proper solution will be based on the #lang line.
