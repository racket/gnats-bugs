>Description:
In the file menu "log definitions and interactions" doesn't work. I'm able to choose a directory but when I start to type a filename, OK button becomes deactive.
I reported same bug in version 3.52 and you told me to replace the dialog-path.ss file from the repository. It worked. But now we have the same problen in version 3.60.

 Is this something you know about?

 That dialog wants you to choose an existing directory -- it will not
 accept a filename.  I'm not sure why this is done, but CCing Robby in
 any case (maybe the menu entry can be improved).

 That was a bug, but the current behavior is intentional.  (At least as
 far as I can tell.)

 You get one log file per click on the run button, and you choose the
 directory where they are stored.
