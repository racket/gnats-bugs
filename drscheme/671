>Description:
Some combination of `execute' and `check syntax' when the program
had a syntax error causes a misuse of a continuation if you
click them fast enough.

>How-To-Repeat:
Open a long program in DrScheme. (I use copies of even-odd
to make 450 lines). Put a syntax error on the last line.
Click Execute then immediately click on Check Syntax. You
get two error messages:

 exception raised by exception handler: continuation application: 
  attempted to apply foreign escape continuation (created in another 
  thread)
 exception raised by exception handler: continuation application: 
  attempt to jump into an escape continuation
