>Description:
I installed DrScheme and associated files on a Windows 98 machine by clicking on the downloaded plt.exe.

I think the user interface is excellent -- really a pleasure to use.
But while the documentation is excellent about all the language features, it doesn't tell you how to do the very simplest thing -- load and run a program!

Specifically:
The directory system the install program set up seems correct -- in the PLT directory is a subdirectory called "collects" and it has subdirectories for the various libraries.
However, when I go to load any *.ss file, DrScheme (full language) always stops on the first "require-relative-library" expression, with the message "there is no current collection for library: <whichever library>", even though the file in question is always there.
I can't find anything about this in the documentation, or any preference to set for search paths.

Thanks in advance for your help.

 For a bug report like this, it's best to provide an actual complete
 program, rather than text such as "Loading any *.ss file".  In
 particular, it would help to establish whether you were doing
 something well-defined in the first place.
 
 Anyway, require-relative-library is not really meant for use from the
 top-level.  You only use it when you're already in a library and want
 to require something from the same library.  As a user, you would
 simply use require-library itself.
 
 For instance, to get CGI support, you would type
 
   (require-library "cgi.ss" "net")
 
 The *implementor* of that library might want to load some other
 program from the same library; instead of having to remember the path
 to it (and update it when it changes), ie, instead of writing
 
   (require-library "url.ss" "net")
 
 he can choose to simply write
 
   (require-relative-library "url.ss")
 
 and DrScheme will fill in the remaining details.
 
 So, please don't use require-relative-library unless you're writing a
 library yourself.  DrScheme's error message is its way of saying, "You 
 haven't even loaded a library, to be loading one *relative* to it."
