>Description:
This is my most nit-picky request of all: I'd love if you would change the keybinding Command-H from "Replace and Find Again" to "Hide DrScheme" -- the convention in OS X is for Command-H to hide the current application. When I'm quickly hiding lots of applications I like to hit Command-H repeatedly, and I have to reach for the mouse to hide DrScheme.

I know, I'm a lazy sod (in the immortal words of Johnny Rotten).

 As the original suggestor of the current meaning of Cmd-H, I agree with 
 Dave's suggestion.
