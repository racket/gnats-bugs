>Description:
When opening a file by double clicking the source icon of a DrScheme program while DrScheme is not yet running, DrScheme opens it twice (in my case two identical tabs) It is not realy a problem for me, but I think you may want to know this. It may be related to problem
http://bugs.plt-scheme.org:80/query/?cmd=view&pr=8805.
PLT is fabulous!
Best wishes, Jos Koot
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The problem was that the path comparison function wasn't quite doing the right thing under windows (it didn't call normal-case-path).
>Release-Note:
no contract violation or type error here as far as I can see.
