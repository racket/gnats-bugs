drscheme sometimes highlights too much for an error

Run: 

(define (diagonal n)
  (local ((define (aux i)
            (cond
              [(zero? i) empty]
              [else (cons (row n) (aux (sub1 i)))]))

                      [else (cons GREEN (row (sub1 k) i))])])))
    (aux n)))

(define RED (make-color 200 20 20))
(define GREEN (make-color 20 200 20))

(equal? 
 (diagonal 3)
 (list (list RED GREEN GREEN)
       (list GREEN RED GREEN)
       (list GREEN GREEN RED)))

The entire cons expression is high-lighted, not just the call to row.

 Here's a shorter program that causes the problem:	
 
 (local ((define (a x) 3)
          (define b (cond [else (a 3 empty)])))
    3)
 
 This could be my fault. I'm looking into it.

 I'm dropping this one back in the pond.  I did find a shorter program 
 that produces the problem:
 
 (let* ([a (lambda (x) 3)]
         [b (a 3 4)])
    3)
 
 That is, the problem has nothing to do with cond.
 
 Expanding this expression in intermediate (by framing it with a module) 
 suggests that the application of 'a' has no source information, which 
 looks like it could cause the problem (I'm guessing that errortrace 
 disregards exps with no source information).  However, I'm unable to 
 see why this would be the case.
 
 In particular, I tried to put debugging printfs in the definition of 
 intermediate-app/proc, only to discover that intermediate-app/proc 
 isn't even called for applications on the rhs of this let.  It's called 
 for top-level applications, but not for these.  I can't figure out why. 
   I'm guessing it will be obvious to Matthew.  If it turns out that this 
 is a forgotten syntax/loc on my part (which it may well be), I 
 apologize.
 
 Another curious thing:  it looks like allow-local-lambda is called 
 twice on rhses of let*; once when it's transformed to a let, and again 
 by the expansion of let.  On a lark, I tried removing the call in let*. 
   Unsurprisingly, it didn't fix the bug.

 Yep. Thanks for tracking down enough pieces to make it obvious.
 
 Fixed and exp-tagged.
