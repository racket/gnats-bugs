>Description:
Since PLT has invested so much work on nice web pages that are
actually usefull, and since it is something very common today, then
I think it's a good idea to have a "DrScheme homepage" entry on the
help menu, or better -- a submenu of relevant URLs.

Also, the about box mentions installed tools, and some of them are
likely have their own URLs, so it would be nice to allow that.

Another thing about the about box -- `check syntax' does not have
an associated icon so it is displayed as just text which makes it
look like the previous label got wrapped.  It is probably better
to include some default icon for such tools.
