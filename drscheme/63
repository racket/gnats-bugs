DrScheme on laptop, bundle made yesterday
>Description:
Start up DrScheme.  Possibly some interactions.  Click on the DrScheme
of "Welcome to DrScheme".  The About box comes up.  If you move your
pointer into this window, a vertical line appears to the right of the
lambdahead image, the height of the entire text on the right.  It goes
past the apparent end of the lambdahead all the way down.  I resized
the window to be even taller, and the line still extends.  Whenever
you move the pointer out, the line disappears, and re-appears when you
come back in.
