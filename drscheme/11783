>Description:
When you change the def window and return to the 
interactions window, you get a yellow warning bar
once you start playing. Good. 

When you click it away with the 'x' on the right, 
it goes away. Good. 

When you perform another interaction, it comes back. 

I thought the point of the 'click away' thingie was
that the bar would disappear until I hit RUN again.
