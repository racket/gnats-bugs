>Description:
There are two (probably related) problems visible when
the code below goes through check syntax: (1) the
first require is red, as if it's not used (and of
course there is no arrow from `matching-identifiers-in')
and (2) `promise?' has no arrow going to the require
that brings it into scope.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/base
(require scheme/require)
(require (matching-identifiers-in
          #rx"\\?$" scheme/promise))
promise?

 I started looking at require transformers, but I'm not seeing how
 check synax gets more information from those docs (altho maybe I
 missed something?).
 
 Any suggestions on where to start would be welcome.
 
 Thanks,
