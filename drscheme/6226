>Description:
If you look very carefully at the contour, you can see that the blue highlight that marks which part of the program is visible, is a bit wrong: it's lowest line is one pixel too low.
>How-To-Repeat:
For best results, scroll to the last line of a long enough program, then scroll one line upwards.
You will see that the top of the contour highlight rises, but the bottom stays the same.

 There are some roundoff issues; a line can be partially visible in the
 main, full size window. In that case, the blue actually covers that
 line.
 
 If that's not what you are seeing, can you send me a screenshot?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 As you can see, part of the line is indeed visible, but that part is 
 completely blank, because it's so small that it's above the text.
 A suggested solution would be to subtract something like 0.35 lines then 
 round it. This way, the top of the line would not matter and only if the 
 line is actually visible it would show it.

 In an ideal world, I think that you'd probably like to round in the
 other direction and maybe at some point we'll find the time to support
 that, but for now I'm sorry to say that maybe we'll just have to live
 with it.
 
 Still, thanks for teh feedback!

 Hmm, just thought of it... Instead of ciel, you can use round, and then 
 all your problems are solved, quite simple.
 But even if you don't, it doesn't really matter...
