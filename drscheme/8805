>Description:
In some cases a new tab is opened when clicking the debug button of DrScheme. The tab has the same contents as the tab being debugged and has state 'not running'. The same happens each time the step button is clicked after returning to the original tab. It seems that in other respects the debugger runs all right, except that halting requires two clicks of the Stop button. Analogous behaviour is found when opening files in separate windows.

>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following a file bug.scm:
(module bug mzscheme (write 1))
Open this file and click Debug, return to original tab/window and click Step.

 By fixing problem 8806, problem 8805 has been fixed as well.
 I am very happy with it.
 I propose to close 8805 as being fixed.
 Thanks
 Jos Koot
