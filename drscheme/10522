 Is there a way to draw the way the selection draws?

 I'm not sure what you're asking here.  (Or even if you're asking me or
 Matthew...)

 Apparently, I'm asking for the 'hilite mode of the brush.
 
 Sorry for not checking the docs (I was on the bus and shouldn't have
 even replied.)

 I'm still not sure what the question is.  I checked how the selection
 draws when the bug is there just in case, and there are no problems in
 that (that is, the whole line with the selected soft newline is
 highlighted).

 The way that first line thing is implemented is that I wrote a
 callback that just draws overtop of the first line of the visible
 portion of the editor. To hilight the selection, as you'd like, I'd
 need to draw that too. (Or am I misunderstanding something?)

 No.  I am.  I somehow confused this reply with the other bug I
 reported that day...  and now your question makes sense.  (And I don't
 know the answer...)

 Turns out that I knew the answer and that I knew how to look it up. Shame o=
 n me.
 
 Anyways, if you are curious, the way you do it is you create a pen &
 brush using the 'hilite style (see the brush%'s constructor). Use
 the-pen-list, or the three argument verison of the set-pen method in
 the dc, of course. ;)

 On second thought, after looking at this PR, I'm not sure it is really
 better to show the selection in the "special" first line. It seems
 okay for it to be drawn just as its text, even if it is highlighted.
