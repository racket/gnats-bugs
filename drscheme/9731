>Description:
When I close (without saving) and reopen DrScheme v372, the 371-tiles.ss teachpack is still listed but doesn't work unless I clear and then re-add the teachpack.

I feel either the teachpack should still work or it should not be listed when DrScheme restarts.

 Thanks for the report. I certainly agree. In the meantime, you can
 click "Run" and the REPL will then have the teachpack working
 properly. No need to remove and re-add.
