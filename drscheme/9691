>Description:
When running a program (#lang scheme) the little man in the lower right corner of the DrScheme GUI runs for a very short time, but halts running long before the program is finished.
Jos 
>How-To-Repeat:
Take any program taking some time, open it with DrScheme and press run button.
>Fix:
The bug was in the way the module language's new front-end/finished-complete-program was being called. All of the clean up actions (like stopping the little man) were happening before calling that method, but should have been happening before
>Release-Note:
this was not a type error or a contract violation.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 22 Aug 2008 09:13:28 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks!
