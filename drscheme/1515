>Description:
I enlarged the font in DrScheme but when I brought up a Help Desk
window the font was still the smaller version. I selected
Edit->Preferences->Font in Help Desk to enlarge the 
font but the change had no effect within the Help Desk window only
in the the original DrScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run DrScheme.
Edit->Preferences: Category->Font
Enlarge Font
Help->Help Desk
In Help Desk window: Edit->Preferences: Category->Font
Enlarge Font
