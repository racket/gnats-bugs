7. Some small bugs with exiting in the Windows version:
   - when the exit question comes, escape does not cancel the exit but just the
     message window (and it _does_ exit).
   - Enter doesn't approve of the exit (only space works).
   - When the definitions buffer is modified, in dialog box for the question
     that pops (save/discard/cancel), the left/right arrows move in the
     opposite directions.

 The latter is definitely fixed in 100. The former is fixed if the
 "Exit" button has the 'border style.
