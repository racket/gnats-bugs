>Description:
Two unlabeled text fields with "<URL>" between them. I thought the first is a command line and the second is some "URL" (probably for testing if browser works).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. DrRacket -> Preferences -> Browser -> Command line.
What happens:
User sees two text unlabeled text fields with "<URL>" between them; also notice that some command line is composed of "pre-text" + URL + "post-text".

What should happen:
User sees two editable text fields labeled "pre-text" and "post-text", also example of constructed command line which updates when user changes "pre-text" and "post-text". Also there is notice that command line is composted of three parts: pre-text, URL itself and post-text. (Also here can be a hint to end pre-text with single quote and start post-text with single quote to make URL quoted in command line)
>Fix:
