>Description:
Amperhands in menu labels trigger underlying behavior, and that's something we want to avoid.  Here's a diff of collects/drscheme/private/unit.ss that fixes the problem:

>How-To-Repeat:
Define a function in a new window

(define (cat&mouse) ...)

In the '(define ...)' popup list on the upper right, the name of the label shows up as "catmouse" with an underline under the m.
>Fix:
the bug is just as Danny described above; the fix is very similar (I didn't make a helper function, and I used a literal regexp, but otherwise the same.)
>Release-Note:
there was no contract violation.

this would not have been detected by a type system.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 18 Aug 2006 17:53:01 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the excellent report!
