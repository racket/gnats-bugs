>Description:
Can't figure out how to make a distribution archive.

In 2.7 executables the doc says:

===========================
The result of Create Executable... is either a launcher executable, a stand-alone executable, or a distribution archive, and it uses either a MzScheme (textual) or MrEd (graphical) engine. For programs implemented with certain languages, Create Executable... will prompt you to choose the executable type and engine, while other languages support only one type or engine.
============================

I can't get a distribution archive.  I only get executables.

After a description of the choices (launcher executable, stand-alone executable, and distribution executable) it says:

=========================
In general, the (module ...) language gives you the most options. 
===========================

I can't find what to do with (module...) to make a distribution archive.

My module looks like this:

=================
(module my-module-name
  mzscheme
  
(define

...

  
  (main))

(require my-module-name)
=================

The documentation doesn't tell me what else to do.

 You need to actually set your language via the "language" menu in
 DrScheme to the "module" language and then try to create an
 executable.
 
 Also, when using the "module" language you do not need the require
 line at the bottom of the file.
