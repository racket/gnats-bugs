When I click on the link to send a bug report in help-desk (opened from the 
Help menu in DrScheme) the following happens:
I receive a popped up window with the title: DrScheme Internal Error and containing the following message:
close-status-line: status line not open browser:hyper.ss
And within the help-desk window I see the following message:
Error Evaluating Scheme Code

((dynamic-require '(lib "bug-report.ss" "help") 'help-desk:report-bug))

reference to uninitialized module identifier: help-desk:report-bug in module: |,/usr/home/kathyg/bin/plt/collects/help/bug-report|

 When I do that, I get a different error in help-desk... (but still have
 the close-status-line error message)
 Error Evaluating Scheme Code
 
 ((dynamic-require '(lib "bug-report.ss" "help") 'help-desk:report-bug))
 
 set-default: tried to register the pref drscheme:email too late;
 preferences:start-writing-timer has already been called
 
 Then I rewind and try again, and get the same error as I reported in the
 bug report.

 Thanks, Kathy. When you get the other message (the module error about
 expected positions) that means that some .zo is out of sync (or that
 the zo compiler is broken, I guess). It would be nice if the
 load-handler could say something about out of sync compilations, but
 that may not be possible. Matthew?
 
 Anyways, the other error should be fixed now. Thanks for pointing it
 out.
