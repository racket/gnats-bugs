Error saving preferences: rename-file-or-directory: cannot rename file or directory: C:\Documents and Settings\Andrei\Application Data\PLT Scheme\TMPPREF1232525519-130094202 to: C:\Documents and Settings\Andrei\Application Data\PLT Scheme\plt-prefs.ss (Access is denied.; errno=5)

(Above message came from a pop-up window from DrScheme)

I was first using DrScheme v 4.x* when this first occurred to me. I know that it takes while for DrScheme to "remember" that it should start maximized. I have been using DrScheme for quite some months already then and by that time DrScheme has already "remembered" to start up maximized. Then this error appeared and suddenly DrScheme "forgot" that it should start maximized.

Because of that I upgraded to v 4.1.3* . As of press time, I have been using 4.1.3 for exactly two weeks and five days. Normally, by this time, I don't expect DrScheme to "remember" to start up maximized. But then this error message appeared again. It is starting to become annoying. Just this session, this message has already popped-up three times, interupting my typing.

Hoping for your quick response,
Chad

====================================================
*As I can't remember what version 4.x exactly is, maybe it would help if I tell you that this particular v4.x doesn't highlight the body of my definitions when I run my programs, as opposed to what 4.1.3 does.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know how to reproduce this bug. It just pops-up at times, often times after the splash screen has finished loading or when I change at a Preference. But that DOES NOT happen everytime.

 I can add something to that dialog so that you can avoid seeing that
 error message more than once per session. Would that help?
 
 (As far as the underlying cause goes, I have no idea.)

 Looking at the code, it seems that there is more to the story than I
 currently understand.
 
 Is it possible that you were clicking a button that says something
 like "Steal the lock & retry"?
 
 Were you running multiple DrSchemes, by any chance? Or multiple
 programs produced by PLT Scheme at all?
 
 Thanks,

 I'd check if it didn't somehow get to a state where the file is
 read-only.

 Under windows, apparently when you open a file, then it cannot be deleted.
 
 (That's what made me ask in a follow up message if there were multiple
 DrSchemes open).

 Thanks for the answers. That is quite helpful. It is possible that the
 games and drscheme are fighting over the preferences file. I'll
 investigate.
