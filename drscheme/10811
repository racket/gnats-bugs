The define-syntax macro facility in EoPL Scheme appears to

 There seems to be a bug in the interaction between DrScheme's debugging 
 mode ("errortrace") and the EOPL language level. There are two workarounds:
 
 1) Disable debugging in DrScheme. To do this, open the "Language" menu 
 and select "Choose Language". Click the "Show Details" button, select 
 the "No debugging or profiling" option, and then click "OK".
 
 2) Specify the EOPL language in your program's source rather than 
 selecting it as the DrScheme language level.
 
 To do this, open the "Choose Language" dialog (see above) and select the 
 "Use the language declared in the source" option. Then add the line 
 "#lang eopl" as the first line of your program. For example:
 
    #lang eopl
    (define-syntax foo
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((_ a ...)
         (eopl:printf "~a\n" (list a ...)))))
    (foo 1 2 3)
 
 Note that in the "eopl" language, printf is renamed eopl:printf.

 A workaround until the bug is fixed: disable debugging. In the
 language dialog, click "show details" and then click the "no debugging
 or profiling" radio box.

 Thanks, Ryan. Sorry I missed your message.
 
 Anyone in favor of keeping the eopl language level in drscheme?
