When I highlight text and select "Special -> Insert Comment Box" (instead of "Scheme -> Comment Out with a Box"), I cannot Undo until I click outside of the newly-created comment box (that has over-written my text).  Undo should work regardless.

 As it turns out, undo does work, but the history of what to undo is
 kept separately for the embedded editor than for the main editor.
 
 I believe we'll be looking into improving this in a future release.
 
 Thanks for the report.
