>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
open drscheme 
choose teaching languages, show detail, 
see case sensitive button selected
run 
choose Module language (with arrows), show detail, 
run 
choose teaching language (with arrows), show detail, 
see case sensitive radio button unselected 

I tested this on my laptop, my desktop, and Stevie's desktop. 
After testing with Stevie, I believe that the bug depends 
on using the arrow keys to change languages.

 Actually, I just reproduced it without using the arrow keys.  After  
 all, it would have been odd to me if it had been doable only with that  
 and not with choosing languages via the mouse.
 
 I do have to go into the language selector though.  When I selected a  
 recently used version of the teaching language, it did not cause "case  
 sensitive" to be unselected.

Reason>>> this is a duplicate of another report and is (probably) related to 10092 on testing
