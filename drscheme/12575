 That is because that window is a modal dialog and input to no other
 windows is allowed.
 
 Are you asking that this behavior be changed?

 It doesn't seem right to be able to pull up a window and then not be able
 to interact with it - I was thrown for a loop.
 
 As I understand them, modal dialogs won't let you leave them and do
 anything back at the parent since usually the parent needs some information
 from the dialog before the parent can continue. In other cases I've seen,
 the modal dialog's title bar flashes and a beep is emitted when attempting
 to send focus back to the parent or any of the parent's other children.
 About the only things you can do is maximize, minimize (iconify), or close
 the parent, all of which I believe are handled by the OS, with the program
 itself only notified by appropriate callbacks.
 
 But in any case, I would suggest that both the Bug Report Form dialog and
 the Configure Search dialog should not be modal. The former results in a
 bug report or nothing and the latter in a search results window or nothing.
 In all cases the parent should not be held up since it doesn't need any
 information (like for example a file to open and process) from the dialog
 to continue doing other things.
 
 Kieron.
