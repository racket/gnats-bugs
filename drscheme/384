>Description:

	Language: intermediate

	Type (read) at prompt
	Put (<html> <title> My First Web Page </title> 
		    <body> Ouch! </ouch> </html>)
	into ReadBox

	I got the following error message: 

	Internal Error: min: expects type <real number> as 1st argument,
	given: #f; other arguments were: 0.0

	When I click on OK, it just keeps repeating it. Looks like an inf loop.

>How-To-Repeat:
	I haven't tried yet but I would be surprised if it didnt' repeat
	this behavior. 
>Fix:
	Hah, if I knew that ...

State-Changed-Why:

I cannot reproduce it in 51/8s1d4. (just released yesterday). 

However, I have setup this nice trick to help find the bug if you can
reproduce it. It turns out that writing `min' inside a unit with no imports
only gives you the primitive min when there are no macros in the toplevel
named `min'. So, I define a min-macro that does source correlation.
