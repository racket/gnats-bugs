 This was fixed in one of the patches. The report says 370p2 and 370p1
 -- which one were you actually using?

 The computer in question seems to be running 370p2.  Sorry for the
 version confusion.

 A stack trace would help, if you can get it (it will be in the error

 Note that I fixed a bug (several, actually) with exactly those
 symptoms and that was the point of either p1 or p2 (I forget which
 now).
