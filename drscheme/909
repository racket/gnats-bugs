>Description:
I was running a (gently) allocating infinite loop.  I waited a few
seconds to make sure it was indeed looping for ever (the expected
behavior), then clicked on Break two or three times.  This brought
up a dialog asking whether I wanted to "Just Break" or "Kill".  I
forget what I selected; I think it was the former.  This brought up
an error message and a "Standard Output" window that both said that
some procedure, either kill-thread or break-thread, had been given
the value #f instead of a #<thread>.

I tried a few times and I can't reproduce this error, but I hope the
name of the primitive is enough to make it clear which one it is.

State-Changed-Why:

the implemenation of the repl has changed substantially since 53; bug
reports about it aren't useful anymore. Also, bug reports that don't
reproduce are generally useless, too....
