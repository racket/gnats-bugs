>Description:
Add 

(require-library "cards.ss" "games" "cards")

to Definitions window. Click execute 10 times. See DrScheme's size 
grow from say 14M to 35M. 

I wouldn't expect that re-loading a library adds memory.

State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Wed Nov 28 20:26:15 2001
State-Changed-Why:
    doesn't seem to happen anymore
    There is still some growth, but
    only a few hundred k after many
    executes and that goes away after
    a few executes the window, but with
    the require line commented out.
