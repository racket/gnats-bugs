>Description:
Hitting C-v in the Web tab's entry buffer doesn't
always cause a paste to happen.  I can't reproduce
this situation, but the first few times I tried it
wouldn't paste, despite pasting into other programs
(such as Mozilla's address bar).  This is how I
ended up "visiting" the blank URL.
