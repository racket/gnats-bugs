>Description:
The documentation for "Insert Test Case" in Help Desk describes a test case as having three editable areas: a comment that names the test, an expression to test, and the right answer.  I don't actually see the first of these; does it still exist?

And is there a way to use a non-default equality predicate in a test case?  I know that there was, several versions ago, and it got in the way in the 99% of cases that a user didn't want to... but it would be nice to have the option, if a suitably non-intrusive user interface could be chosen.

 I thought I had removed test case boxes... am I forgetting and I
 didn't really do it, or was there something I was waiting for? I
 forget the status of this one.
 
 Thanks,

 They're gone now from the implementation, but they were still in v360
 --- and even now, they're still in the manual.

 Ah! I had read "Insert Text Box" as "Insert Test Box". Duh!
 
 I'll update the manuals. Sorry for missing that.

 I've removed mention of the test boxes for the next release (test
 boxes themselves were removed a little while ago).
