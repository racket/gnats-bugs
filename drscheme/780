>Description:
The state indicating if the program has been saved or not isn't always
correctly updated by the undo command.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a new window.
Type "hi".  Notice the "Save" button appears.
Hit save.  Notice it goes away.
Type " hi".  Notice the button is back.
Hit save.  Notice it goes away.
Type C-m z.  The second "hi" disappears, but the save button isn't there.
Close the window.
Notice that the file is out of date, even though supposedly it did not
need saving.
