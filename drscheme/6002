>Description:
Excuse me, i know that you are really busy, but i need your help.
To reproduce the bug, on my laptop, i must only use the draw.ss library
and call the start function to draw a canvas of any dimension.
The canvas opens right, but the DrScheme goes into a loop: it seems to call
infinitly times the canvas, infact as i break, the program comes back to the
read/write status.

    My operative system is Win Xp prof. with serv pack 1 and all the other
little upgrade of its.
My processor is a P4 2,5 ghz in a acer Travelmate 427LC.

Can you help me please?
