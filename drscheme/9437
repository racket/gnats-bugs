>Description:
Running drscheme using mzscheme on a windows xp pro machine

difference between (read-line) in the drscheme environment and a created executable.

In the environment (read-line) returns "asdf" when I type "asdf".
In the same program run as an executable (read-line) returns "asdf\n" when I type "asdf".


This was my fix.  It's kind of sloppy, I did it after I was finished.
It was sloppier before I cleaned it up just now, so I may have introduced a bug or two.

;; trim trailing cr from a string.
;; this is because when compiled the program returns the cr with 
;; read-line
(define (trim-trailing-cr str)
  (if (and (string? str)
           (not (string=? "" str))
           (equal? #x0D 
                   (char->integer (car (reverse (string->list str))))))
      (list->string (reverse (cdr (reverse (string->list str)))))
      str))

(define (my-read-line . a)
  (trim-trailing-cr
   (if (null? a)
       (read-line)
       (read-line (car a)))))
>How-To-Repeat:
When I do (read-line) from the drscheme environment and enter "asdf" I get "asdf".  

When I do the same thing from the same program run from an executable, I get "asdf\r" i.e. the string appended with an ascii <cr> (#x0D)

I would prefer to not get the <cr>, but it's more important that they are the same.
