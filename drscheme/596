The set of grayed items in the file menu is funny if the definitions
pane is closed.

I think that New and Open should still be available, since
these options open an entire new window and have nothing
to do with the current file being edited.

Also, the recently fixed "Save Definitions As Text..." option
is not grayed out, while the other ways to save the definitions
are gray.  This is inconsistant.
>How-To-Repeat:
Close the definitions section.  Open the file menu.

 I've figured out how to have the new Save Definitions As Text...
 become grayed out.  However, I don't like the code I've used
 as the solution.  It relies on the relative position of the 
 item within the file menu.
 
 It's easy enough to have New and Open remain enabled, independent
 of whether the definitions are hidden.  If everyone agrees
 with Paul G. on that score, I'll implement it.
