>Description:
Found when running images tests after a git pull. This error causes "images/tests/icon-tests.rkt" to fail when run in DrRacket. The test requires `images/compile-time', which itself requires `racket/draw' normally and for syntax.

Best guess is that it has to do with recent changes to support submodules.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this program in DrRacket:

#lang racket/load

(module provider racket/base
  (require (for-syntax racket/draw)
           racket/draw))

(require 'provider)

Get this error:

link: reference (phase 1) to a variable in module "<base path>/collects/racket/draw/private/font.rkt" that is uninitialized (phase level 0); reference appears in module: "<base path>/collects/racket/draw/private/dc-path.rkt" in: font%

The program runs fine from command-line Racket.

 Just found out this fails in DrRacket but not command-line Racket:
 
 #lang racket
 (require (for-syntax racket/draw)
 racket/draw)
 
 link: reference (phase 1) to a variable in module 
 "/home/neil/plt/collects/racket/draw/private/font.rkt" that is 
 uninitialized (phase level 0); reference appears in module: 
 "/home/neil/plt/collects/racket/draw/private/dc.rkt" in: get-pango-attrs1.1
 
 This removes one level of indirection from the steps to reproduce.
