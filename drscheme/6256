>Description:
In the Help Desk history, it says "Help Desk search results" 
for every search.  It would be lots more useful if the 
search term were included in the history.

Likewise, when clicking on one of the search results, it would 
be useful for the history to mention what the search term had 
been, rather than just the manual name.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use Help Desk.
