>Description:
Backtrace is broken again, although only in certain cases; textual language level.  See below for details.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following into the definitions window and hit execute:
  (require (lib "class.ss"))

  (define base%
    (class object% ()
      [init x-init]
      [field (x x-init)]
      (super-new)))
Then evaluate (new base%) at the REPL.  Click on the ladybug, and get the error "+: expects type <number> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: 0"

However, if you enter the following into the definitions window
  (define (f x) (+ x 3))
  (define (g x) (f (car x)))
then evaluate
  (g '(x y z))
at the repl, clicking on the ladybug gives the expected results.

 I think the word is "still" not "again". :)

 Oh, my bad.  I thought you'd committed a fix the last time I hit this
 bug; I guess I'm misremembering.  Sorry 'bout that....

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Tue, 01 Feb 2005 20:13:01 -0500
Reason>>> drscheme

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 14 Mar 2005 22:07:15 -0500
Reason>>> seems to be fixed now (not sure when that happened tho).
