Human Language: english

>Description:
In the following text for the expand-program docs, I see two typos:



*The current-load parameter is set to a procedure calls the 

language's front-end method, instead of jus using read. 



First, I believe there should be a "that" between "procedure" and

"calls", and second, "jus" should be "just".
