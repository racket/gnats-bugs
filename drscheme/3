>Description:
drscheme 49/10, linux (although I'd bet this is OS-independent [1]).

Bundled about 11pm this evening.

[minbar (ttyp0):~]> drscheme -x 
load: could not open file for input: "include.ss" (2)

and then you get the EdJr thing.

Did a quick check of the directory containing the installation; no
include.ss, include.zo, or include.* in the entire distribtion.

[minbar (ttyp4):~/plt/49]> find . -name "include.ss" -print
[minbar (ttyp4):~/plt/49]> find . -name "include.*" -print
[minbar (ttyp4):~/plt/49]> 

(I have a couple of different versions of the plt stuff installed, and I'm
using Mark's pltprogs script, slightly edited, to choose between them.
Thus the /plt/49.)

MrEd starts fine, and it's 49/10, so PLTHOME is getting set correctly.

[1] Matthew keeps saying that platform independence is a myth.  Oh
well...at least *this* bug will happen in the same fashion, regardless of
OS!  <grin>

State-Changed-Why:

I changed around the entire startup and this bug disappeared. Go ahead and
rebundle. Sorry it took so longto reply.

>Unformatted:

I have no idea what I'm doing here.  In fact, far as I can tell, the
system won't even tell you who I am.  (Okay, this is Shriram.)
Anyway, Richard, this problem should be fixed now.  Are you getting a
message telling you so?
