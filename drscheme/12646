 And there is now a suggested fix:
 
   https://github.com/plt/racket/pull/91
 
 Reminder: to apply it, you can do something like this
 
   curl https://github.com/plt/racket/pull/91.patch | git am
 
 (And I can do that, if you want me to.)

 Given the number of times these easter eggs have failed, making
 DrRacket totally useless for our users for the day, we either need a
 much better testing story for them, or to remove them.

 I'll do something better, testing wise.
 
 If the consensus is to remove them, however, I will. (Not happily, of course.)

 I think we owe our users an explanation of how we are going to ensure
 that this doesn't happen again.  If we can provide that, then we
 should definitely keep the easter eggs, which are lots of fun.  If we
 can't provide that, though, then keeping them is asking our users to
 deal with these problems in front of their colleagues and students.

 Could testing it be as simple as setting the system date to these 
 special days and starting DrRacket?
 
 I suppose the biggest problem is keeping the code in sync with the 
 tests. Maybe a separate module with a table of type (Listof (Pair (Date 
 -> Boolean) (-> Bitmap))) would help.

 FWIW, my plan is to change the way DrRacket looks at the date; it'll
 check an environment variable and, if it is set, pretend (for the
 purposes of starting the splash screen), that that's today's date.
 Then I'll script the start up of DrRacket on various important dates
 and make sure that DrRacket starts up.

 Although this is probably too expensive to do in DrDr/the nightly
 builds, we should also run this test for all 365/366 dates in our
 release tests.
 
 Would it also be possible to allow DrRacket to start up even if some
 portion of the splash screen fails?

 Why did you pick that many days in particular?

 I think it could be possible to add something like this, but I think
 that testing the different days is more effective. We haven't had much
 trouble with the general parts of the splash screen (and they are
 tested a lot anyways), and the problems we have had are pretty simple
 ones, once we realize what is going on (like in this case and the only
 other case I can remember).

 I was just suggesting that we test with *every* date in some
 particular year (presumably the current one), since I don't think we
 have any year-conditional behavior in DrRacket.  If we add some year
 conditional behavior, we would probably want even more tests.

 I agree that the testing is more important -- I was suggesting that we
 do both, in case we miss something with our tests.

 I wouldn't do this on my own, but if you insist, you can put it on my
 release checklist.

 Looking at the code, I think that testing is sufficient and adding
 more error handling code is just going to make things more
 complicated. We're not dealing with unknown code here that we want to
 protect against -- we just have N conditionals that we need to be sure
 to exercise.

 Actually, on second thought, I think that the testing-every-day
 approach is just not going to be useful with my current approach to
 testing the splash screen. The testing approach I'm taking really
 relies on the code to cooperate by looking at the environment variable
 to find out what day is should pretend today is. Iterating over all of
 the days in hopes of finding additional bugs in that mode is unlikely
 to be profitable.
 
 If, however, we can script setting the date at the OS level and then
 starting up DrRacket, that seems like it would have a chance of
 finding a bug. I'm guessing that a linux VM is the way to go with that
 test.
 
 Does that sound right to you?

 There is, however, day-of-week-conditional behavior.  I HOPE we don't have anything that's conditional on BOTH date-in-year AND day-of-week, or we'll have considerably more test cases to run....

 So I tried to write a script that would set the date, start up
 DrRacket, etc. for 366 days, starting from the day the script is run,
 and am running into trouble scripting the date change. I first tried
 just do 'sudo' and figuring I'd have to type my password four or so
 times to get through the whole year, which seemed okay, but the way
 sudo works by avoiding asking you to re-type your password is defeated
 by changing the date (sigh). So I thought I'd try to make a script
 that was a setuid root script to set the date, but I can't seem to
 figure out how to make that work. Here's what I have:
 
 -r-sr-xr-x 1 root root 30 2012-03-27 21:54 set-date.sh
 
 where the set-date.sh file contains this:
 
   #!/bin/sh
   /bin/date $1
 
 but when I run it, it doesn't seem to actually get the right permission:
 
   $ ./set-date.sh 03280001
   /bin/date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted
   Wed Mar 28 00:01:00 CDT 2012
 
 Is there some other way I can script this? Or something stupid I'm
 doing wrong here?
 
 Is there perhaps a way I can, via the ffi, trick Racket into using a
 different date at some low-level?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 1. You generally can't have scripts that run in suid mode -- only
    proper programs.  (That's at least the usual thing in unix
    systems.)
 
 2. A better solution would be to just add yourself to /etc/sudoers --
    making it possible to sudo with no password, possibly for a
    specific command, and possibly you can do this before testing and
    turn it off after testing.  (Note that you don't just edit the
    file, you use `visudo' which arranges for changes to take effect.)
 
 3. But playing with the system time sounds like asking for trouble.
    If `current-seconds' is the single entry point, you can have a
    patch that you'd apply for testing, that always adds some offset to
    the real value, and compile a tree with the patch in to try it.  Or
    even at the C level, do something like change (this is just an
    untested sketch)
 
      intptr_t scheme_get_milliseconds(void)
      ...code...
 
    to
 
      intptr_t scheme_get_milliseconds(void) {
        return atoi(getenv("PLTDAYOFFSET"))*60*60*24
               + real_scheme_get_milliseconds();
      }
      intptr_t real_scheme_get_milliseconds(void)
      ...same code...
 
    and again, compile a binary with this in just for testing.  (You
    could also add it in the code with some #ifdef.)
 
 4. Something that looks even more promising is described here:
    http://lwn.net/Articles/180375/ -- basically allowing you to change
    the concept of time for a single process (with its children), which
    would work for the system time and file times etc.  But it doesn't
    look like it got into the main kernels of the machines that I see.
    (To try it, just run `unshare -h'.)  Surprising, since it's
    described (in 2006) as something that is going to go into the
    kernel.  Parhaps there is some setup somewhere that does have it,
    or something similar.

 Especially because this situation has happened before.

 My apologies for my last reply, which on a second reading sounds
 insulting. I did not originally intend that meaning, but when I read
 it again, I can totally see that.
 
 Constructively: would a toplevel exception handler around the easter
 egg code be helpful?  Defensively coding that part of the code seems
 appropriate to me.

 No, I don't think so. But maybe you'll see something I missed if you
 take a look?
