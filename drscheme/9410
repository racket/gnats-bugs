>Description:
Before I updated today, I've always been able to evaluate basic expressions at DrScheme's REPL, even when DrScheme is in the module language and I haven't actually loaded a module definition by hitting Run.

This no longer works.  Typing a basic expression like "3" at the REPL gives the error message:

    compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: (#%top-interaction . 3)

This is awfully inconvenient, to say the least.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set DrScheme to the module language.
Restart DrScheme.
Enter any scheme expression at the REPL.

 I believe this is the right behavior, as one should not expect that
 "3" is a valid program without somehow informing drscheme as to the
 langauge (and, at the moment, the only way to do that is to run the
 program).

 I see your point, but this makes it prohibitively inconvenient to use
 DrScheme for quick computations that don't actually require any code
 loaded.  I find this comes up fairly frequently, often when I wonder, "hey,
 what happens when I ...?"

 At the moment, the best thing I have for you is to type "#lang scheme"
 at the top of the window and then put the test expression below that.
 It is a little more typing, but I think it actually works a little bit
 better than the REPL.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Thu, 16 May 2013 23:50:55 -0400
Reason>>> DrRacket now inserts a default language (such as #lang 
racket) so this is no longer an issue.
