>Description:
Inserting a graphical lambda into a ;-comment causes 
syntax coloring and paren matching to resume *after* 
the lambda. Because of this, paren matching can be thrown
off for the rest of the buffer.

(discovered during TeachScheme 2)
>How-To-Repeat:
(let ()
; (define x (\ (y) y))
  (x 1))

Put a graphical lambda in for the \. Observe coloring.
Observe red final parenthesis.
