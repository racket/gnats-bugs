>Description:
	If someone writes a diabolical define-macro, it can break drscheme.
	zodiac doesn't protect against the macros well enough.
zodiac needs to make sure that parameter changes don't affect the running
drscheme. See the parameterization sections of the mzscheme manual for
more info.

>How-To-Repeat:

This will kill drscheme:

	(define cust #f)
	(define-macro m (lambda () (set! cust (current-custodian))))
	(m)
	(custodian-shutdown-all cust)

also:

	(define-macro m (lambda () (load-mzscheme-test-suite) '(void)))
	(m)

should work.

 Note that the first example code currently causes a segmentation fault in
 drscheme.

 The fixed version of MrEd produces an equivalent DrScheme, modulo a
 core file: DrScheme will exit. The reason is that the initial
 custodian also owns the main thread.
