>Description:
The request I'd like to make is the following. When I run my Scheme file, and a critical error occoured, which will crash the DrScheme application, the currently unsaved files are lost.
I would like to have an option to automatically save the file, when running (or debugging) the current Scheme.
Thank you,
 Hans.
P.S. I am really pleased with DrScheme and the PLT Scheme enviroment! Thank you, for this wonderful programming IDE.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file, and cause a critical error (like a memory-overrun or an unknown bug). The file will be lost, when the DrScheme application is closed due this critical error.
