In our lab environment, most users only have read and

under Windows NT.  However, under Windows 2000, an "error 
saving preferences" occur with the body of the error
stating:  "error flushing file port (Invalid argument;
errno=22)".  Users with administrative rights do not
receive this error.

1.  Start the program.

 If you set the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables for the 
 users to point to a place they have write permission, the problem 
 should go away.
 
 I say "should" because I don't have a machine to test it on. I 
 believe, however, that those environment variables control the 
 placement of the preferences file, which is the problem.
 
 Hope that helps,
 Robby
