 This one has been resisting my attempts to narrow it down for some
 time now. I am submitting it, but I will try to find more information
 about it.

 Thanks for the suggestion, Matthew (via John). It was, in fact, the
 syntax checker. I have fixed the bug; now it should only flicker when
 the arrows are actually being drawn (and in low memory conditions). 
 
 committed and tagged PLT/collects/drscheme/tools/syncheck/unit.ss.
 
 Please let me know if you see the flickering now.
