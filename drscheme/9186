>Description:
The SchemeUnit tool broke.

Previously, drscheme:debug:get-cm-key produced a list of things that could be fed directly into drscheme:debug:show-backtrace-window. In recent DrScheme, the list of things requires additional processing (to turn them into srclocs). The documentation for 'get-cm-key' in drscheme/private/tool-contract.ss is wrong: it claims that the values associated with the key are srclocs, but they are lists.

 The docs don't say that, actually (but I can see how they aren't super
 clear ...). The docs say that they are lists, of the fields of a
 srcloc. So hopefully all you have to do is call make-srcloc of the
 elements of the list that you get out of the srcloc.
 
 I was hesitant to put things that are not read/write invariant into
 the continuation marks, but maybe that is safe? Anyone know?

 Ah, you're right. Reading the docs closer, I see that.

 It would be more convenient for tool writers if show-backtrace-window 
 did this instead. Why make tools depend on DrScheme's representation(s) 
 of debugging information when they don't need to?

 My guess is that the safe way is also slow. But you'd have to ask 
 Matthew to be sure.

 What is the context in which you're calling that function? Something
 in the macro debugger?

 I've made drscheme:debug:show-backtrace-window accept an exn (in
 addition to the list of source locations).
