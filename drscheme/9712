>Description:
When F1 is hit while the cursor is at the end of a token suitable for searching, it usually searches for that in the documentation.  However, if there is nothing after the cursor (even whitespace causes the correct behavior), F1 does not search for that token, but rather it opens the main help page.

There's been plenty of times where I'll just type something at the REPL purely to hit F1, and with this behavior I have to move back into the token to cause it to search for it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type in something to search for in the definitions window or at the REPL (with nothing following) and hit F1 while your cursor is on the right-hand side of it.
>Fix:
Passed 'after-or-none to find-snip, when 'after is what I really wanted.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor was it a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 27 Aug 2008 00:48:56 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks.
