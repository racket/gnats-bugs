>Description:
The Programming Environment Manual has several documentation bugs with
regard to tools in v51.

(1) The manual says the tool unit imports 6 units matching the signatures
    and then lists 7 signatures.  Of these the last, plt:parameters^
    is the bogus one.

(2) The documentation refers to drscheme:get/extend:extend-frame when
    in fact it is drscheme:get/extend:extend-unit-frame  (plus the %)

(3) The documentation of the extenders, in addition to the above mis-name,
    and the puzzling (if documented) omission of the %,  show prototypical
    usages that don't in fact correspond to how the extenders would
    be used.  They all are shown being applied to no arguments,
    rather than to the extending procedure (of type class->class).
    For example, you show

    (drscheme:get/extend:extend-interactions-edit) -> void 

    when in fact this is not how it would be used.

 Thanks for the clarifications. I think that the I missed the docs when I
 changed these last. Sorry about that. The interface will change a little
 bit again (some methods of the standard classes are now just regular
 functions) and I will clean up these docs for the next release (due out
 soon, a few weeks hopfully)
 
 Let me know if you have any questions that the manual doesn't answer.
