>Description:
I'm sending a file by attachment to plt-internal.  When this file
comes as an attachment in a mail message and I click on it, DrScheme
fires up [NB: Windows calls it a "MrEd-based application", which may
be confusing to people who've never heard of MrEd], but it's in
Read-Only mode.  I Save As to save it to my filesystem and edit it.
When I save as, it *reproducibly* loses the first part of the file!
Everything up to POST-WIDTH is lost -- that is, the first character in
the file is the P of POST-WIDTH.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The bug occurred when saving any file that was read-only. The code that inserted the metadata (as preparation for saving) was getting blocked by the read-only status of the window.
>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation, nor was it a type error.

 I used Alt+Enter to see some file.ss's properties, and I see:
 
   Type of file: PLT Scheme Document
   Opens with: [logo] MrEd-based application
 
 so even if the second line is confusing, the first one should clear
 out most of the confusion.
 
 BTW#1, it looks like this string is pulled right out of the drscheme
 executable, which in turn originates from a line in the mred resource
 file ("worksp/mred/mred.rc"), so changing it will be difficult
 (probably hacking the binary executable to put the new string in).
 
 BTW#2, I doubt that this should be modified even if it was easier,
 since that same information is displayed when you look at the file
 properties dialog of DrScheme.exe -- I get:
 
   Type of file: Application
   Description: [logo] MrEd-based application
 
 which makes much more sense.

 If it is source we control, we probably want to (in future versions)
 have it say "PLT Scheme based application" or something like that,
 tho?

 That's not a choice you have when you just click on a file as an
 attachment.  When you do, Firefox (at least) brings up a window that
 gives you two choices:
 
 - save to file
 - open with ...
 
 and the ... is the default application, and this is where the "MrEd"
 bit appears.  So a response based on saving the file to disk and
 looking at is properties is essentially irrelevant to the context at
 hand, sorry.
 
 That's separate from saying that this is hard to fix, etc.

 OK, I can change that.  I committed "PLT Scheme based GUI
 application"?
 
 I'm not sure if "MzScheme-based application" should also changed to
 the text without "GUI" -- ?

 [Can you please provide such descriptions in the future?  I did try
 several things, and the file properties was the only place I have seen
 a slight problem -- slight because of the above.]
 
 When I click a scheme file in IE, I get
 
   Name: x.scm
   Type: PLT Scheme Document, 651 bytes
   From: tmp.barzilay.org
 
 So that one's fine.  When I try it with FF, Safari, or Opera, I just
 get the contents in the browser.  After reading the above, I tried
 sending myself a file to make sure that I get it as a downloadable
 attachement, and I still don't see a big problem:
 
 * Safari says: Type: Text Document,
 
 * Opera says: Type: PLT Scheme Document, Open with: MrEd-based ...
 
 and...

 ... with FF I see this:
 
   You have chosen to open
   [logo] x.scm
     which is a PLT Scheme Document
     from: https://mail.google.com
   what should Firefox do with this file?
    [x] Open with MrEd-based application (default)
    [ ] Save file
 
 So the "PLT Scheme Document" is still there.

 Probably a good idea. That's one of the v4 pushes is to present less
 of a loose confederation of tools and more of a united state.

 OK, I made it "PLT Scheme based application".
 
 Matthew: perhaps you'd want it to be "PLT Scheme based textual
 application"?  Also, I changed the InternalName fields to have no .exe
 in them, which is why the page on MSDN specifies.  (Doesn't look like
 it makes any difference anyway.)

 I'm also changing the ProductName to "PLT Scheme" on both rc files.
 MSDN says "Specifies the name of the product with which the file is
 distributed".

 Seems better without "textual".
 
 How about dropping "based" in both cases?

 OK, done -- and I also changed "worksp/starters/start.rc" in a similar
 way to the previous two.
