>Description:
Search-again <cmd-G> in the lower pane of the "Find in Files..."

window causes the following error:



send: no such method: search-again for class: search-size-frame%



>How-To-Repeat:
Choose Find in Files..., do some kind of search, after it's done,

give the focus to the lower pane, type <cmd-g> (mac binding for

search-again).



>Fix:

>Release-Note:
the bug: the editor and the frame in the search results
window did not match up (one supported searching, but
the other didn't)

Classic case for contracts.
