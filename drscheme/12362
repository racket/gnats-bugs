>Description:
Besides the steps to reproduce, I've been able to write an image snip into a .rkt file with size 400.0 x 400.0. This made it impossible to load the file - I kept getting the same error.

I can't reproduce that one, though. It happened incidentally while I was testing plot's image snips. The fact that I can't reproduce it is now driving me crazy.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang racket

(require racket/draw racket/snip)

(define snip (make-object image-snip% (make-bitmap 100 100)))
(send snip resize 100.0 100.0)
snip


Then try to select the snip, and get this error in a pop-up:

initialization for bitmap%: bad argument combination: 100.0 100.0

 === context ===
next

/home/neil/plt/collects/racket/private/class-internal.rkt:3627:0: continue-make-object

Then DrRacket freezes.
