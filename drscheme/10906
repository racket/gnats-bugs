>Description:
Double-click in DrScheme IDE should be more consistent with Scheme naming conventions. It should select until reaching a paren, bracket, or space, but not break on a "/". In other words "/" should be treated like "-" for example.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Double-click a phrase like "foo-bar". All of it will be selected.
2. Double-click a phrase like "foo/bar".
Actual Result: Only the half you clicked in, on either side of the "/" will be selected.
Expected Result: The full phrase should be selected.
>Fix:
