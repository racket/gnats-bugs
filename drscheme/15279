 Can you say more about exactly what you did? Which repository did you
 pull from? Did you run `make`, or `make as-is` or something else,
 after doing the pull? Did you restart DrRacket? Does this happen with
 running the program at the command line? What about running `raco make
 -v` on that program?

 Sure thing. 
 
 My origin points to git@github.com:racket/racket.git, and I’m on master. Specifically, HEAD is at bcacb34.
 
 I did a git fetch, git pull —ff-only, and a plain ‘make’.  DrRacket was not running during the upgrade.
 
 Programs appear to run fine at the command-line.  Here’s a transcript (including make -v):
 
 pcp143349pcs:/tmp clements> racket ./foo2.rkt
 1
 pcp143349pcs:/tmp clements> raco make -v foo2.rkt
 "foo2.rkt":
  [already up-to-date at "compiled/foo2_rkt.zo"]
 pcp143349pcs:/tmp clements> rm compiled/foo2_rkt.*
 pcp143349pcs:/tmp clements> raco make -v foo2.rkt 
 "foo2.rkt":
   making #<path:/tmp/foo2.rkt>
  [output to "compiled/foo2_rkt.zo"]
 pcp143349pcs:/tmp clements>

 No, DrR has only one tab open, containing the file as submitted in the bug report. The bug still appears to be reproducible (though I’m going home now; I could try it there, too).

 I had the bright idea of turning on logging (with error level set to “warning”), and what I see is thousands and thousands of lines like this:

 This suggests to me that TR/DrR is recompiling vast swaths of the source tree. I can’t see why this would be the case; the files in question aren’t open as tabs …
 
 I checked it out, and sure enough, DrR is creating compiled/drracket files for many many files. This is presumably why you (Robby) asked me if I had a tab open on a file in the plot library.
 
 …
 
 Okay, I moved my prefs file (the .rktd one) to /tmp/, and the problem went away. Stranger still, I moved it back again, and the problem is still gone. I can think of many possible ways that this could happen, but none of them really seem all that sensible. 
 
 I’m going to close this bug now…
 
 John

 Mysterious. If it does come back, then maybe a closer look at the logs
 will help us understand.
