Here's a file that Check Syntax's but that doesn't Run/compile.

 This program is compiling fine, and then producing a runtime error.
 This program is doing the same thing:
 
 #lang scheme
 
 (define x y)
 (define y 0)

 I get this when I run:
 
   reference to an identifier before its definition: bar?
 
 and it check syntaxes fine, which seems like the correct behavior to
 me. Check syntax does not signal runtime errors, only compile time
 errors.
 
 Also, just as a side note: the change only affects files that are
 required, not the file in the definitions window. Roughly speaking, if
 a file is required, but is not in the main collections tree, then it
 is compiled and saved to the compiled/ directory instead of just being
 compiled and keeping the compilation in memory.
