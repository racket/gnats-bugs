 ... That's just the way that DrScheme works.  The reason it's like 
 that is that DrScheme is a cross-platform application, and on 
 platforms like Windows & X Windows, the menu bars are attached to the 
 window itself.  Therefore, if you close all the windows associated 
 with an application, there's no way to bring it to the foreground or 
 use any of its menus.
 
 So... that's something we just deal with.
