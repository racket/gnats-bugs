 Actually, mz doesn't let me know all of them. I'm not sure if that's
 something that's planned for the future, or if it might cause security
 problems. I've just got a list of the ones I know from the manuals in
 the source code.

 For now, just add them to the syntax-properties function in
 plt/collects/drscheme/private/syntax-browser.ss

 How about a preference pane that allows programmers to specify interned 
 symbols that should be added to this list?  So I might add 
 "stepper-hint" to the pane, and then I see the stepper-hint property 
 when I open a syntax object?  That sounds like twenty minutes of coding 
 (* poor-clements-estimation = 1 1/2 hours).  Looks like the hardest 
 part would be figuring out which preference pane to put it in.
 
 Naturally, this wouldn't work for syntax-properties linked to 
 non-symbols, and I would argue that this is probably the right thing; 
 if you choose a non-symbol as the key to your syntax-property, it's 
 probably so that other people can't see it.

 Yeah, something like that (assuming mz doesn't help me out :) is good,
 but I was thinking of something more like with Jens suggested, attached
 to the display itself.

 Probably MzScheme should provide a way to get the list of property keys
 that are interned symbols. After all, if you're using an interned
 symbol, then there's no security, because someone might guess it.
