Teachpack filenames: ()
Computer Language: (("Experimental Languages" "ProfessorJ" "Beginner") ((field) (#t)))
>Description:
When the language level is set to ProfessorJ and the text 
mode is set to Java Mode, as soon as the user saves the 
current file, the text mode switches back to Scheme Mode.
>How-To-Repeat:
Change the language level to ProfessorJ: Beginner Custom
and change the text mode to Java Mode. Type some Java code,
so you could verify that the Java Mode color coding is being
performed by DrScheme. Save the file and check the text
mode. It would switch back to Scheme mode.
>Fix:
this is really a change in the functionality. There is no contract associated with it.
