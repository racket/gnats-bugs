new-world, of course, 49s1, beginner level.

>Description:
	
Execute in drscheme fails to stop executing after the first error.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
The program:

22
(foobarbazball 3)
33
(whatchamacallit 5)
44
(car 4)
55

The output includes 22, 33, 44, and 55.  The (car 4) is highlighted.
The result:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 49s1.
Vocabulary: Beginner.
22
reference to unbound identifier: foobarbazball33
reference to unbound identifier: whatchamacallit44
car: expects type <pair> as 1st arg; given 4 (type <fixnum-integer>)55

 If anyone updates this, could you please keep me posted on your
 updates?  This _might_ be relevant to a problem I've been seeing
 outside of DrScheme.
