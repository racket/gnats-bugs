>Description:
I think the trigger to this was that I opened a file (actually two files) in DrScheme, and then in another window, renamed the folder that they were in, so the pathname under which DrScheme had opened them became invalid.  DrScheme had every right to complain (and it did, with a reasonable error message about invalid pathnames).... but it did NOT have the right to then freeze, ignoring all menu and keyboard input, and flicker one of the document windows ad infinitum.  I ended up doing a "ps x | grep PLT" and "kill" from the shell.

 I will leave the Scheme bug in until you have a look at the low-level
 one. Let me know, okay?
 
 Thanks,

Reason: I can't try this on OSX, but on Linux there is an 
indication that something is wrong -- when I try to save a 
file that is in a directory that no longer exists, I see 
an error on the std error:
save-file in text%: cannot open output file: ...
This should probably be caught in DrScheme.

Reason: there is a scheme-level bug, but I'm leaving this PR to point to the lowlevel 
one, only. there are other prs for the scheme-level one.

Reason>>> I fixed the flickering problem a few months ago in v299.
