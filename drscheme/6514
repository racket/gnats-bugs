>Description:
When you click "Check Syntax", the "Execute" button
is disabled. But F5 seems to work, still.

I sometimes accidentally hit F6 then hit F5, so Execute and
Check Syntax fight over the definitions window (or other
things, I guess). The window becomes broken as a result.
>How-To-Repeat:
Press F6
Press F5 before Check Syntax completes
>Fix:
the bug: the callbacks for the keystrokes weren't diabled for
either execute or check syntax. They now check the state of
their respective buttons before running.
>Release-Note:
should have been a contract check -- the callbacks shouldn't
have been invoked. the contract check was missing.

 This is probably just me not disabling the key stroke properly... You
 couldn't click the buttons like that, right?
