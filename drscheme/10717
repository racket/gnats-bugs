>Description:
If you type an expression in Interactions that's missing the initial left-parenthesis, the right-parenthesis is highlighted red (as one would expect), but if you go ahead and hit ENTER anyway, you're stuck.  You don't get a prompt, you don't get an error message, it doesn't matter what else you type.  The "Stop" button doesn't help, but the "Run" button does.

Not Beginner-Friendly.

 Please hit the backspace key and go remove the close paren and hit return a=

 The above sentence is not bug-report-fixer friendly, for that matter.  ;)

 The reason I mention this is that as recently as 4.1.3 (IIRC) the  
 behavior was different: if you typed something with more right-parens  
 than left-parens (i.e. not a possible prefix of anything meaningful)  
 and hit ENTER, you got an error message immediately rather than  
 silence.  I propose that that was better behavior, at least in student  
 languages.
 
 Sorry if I came off snotty in the bug report :-)
