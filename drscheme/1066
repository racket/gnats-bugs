MS Windows 98
>Description:
Ctl-T (transpose letter) produces an internal error when the
caret is at the very beginning of an editor. (I have menu
keybindings turned off, so Ctl-T is transpose rather than
execute under Windows 98.)

The error is:
 insert in text% (string and position case): expects argument of type <non-negative exact integer>; given -1
