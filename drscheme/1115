>Description:
I can't download or read the uninstalled manuals such as mred-doc, probably because DrScheme doesn't know about our firewall proxy. I get the following message:

Cannot display
"http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/100/DocBundles
/mred-doc.plt": tcp-connect: connection to www.cs.rice.edu,
port 80 failed (1:11002 host not found)

Is there a way to set the proxy?

BTW, the above error message appeared in a window after clicking the download link, but I when I highlighted the text, it did not get copied to the clipboard. (Or at least, it didn't appear when I tried to paste it in here.)
>How-To-Repeat:
In Help Desk, pick an uninstalled manual and try to read or download it.

 Sorry, the Web library in the net collection (which the Web browser
 uses) doesn't handle proxies.  I can look into adding proxy support,
 though frankly it's not highest on my list of priorities.  (I have
 sympathy for your needs, I'm just warning you to not expect it in a
 hurry.)  Contributions, on the other hand, are always welcome! (-:

 Has someone informed this guy that he can download the .plt file with
 some other proxy-supporting program and then just use "open url" in help
 desk to load in the docs?
 
 If not, I think we should :)

 Please note that you could also just download the .plt file with your
 conventional Web browser and install it by hand.

 Robby,
 
 For PR 1115, you wrote:

 It looks like that page is embedded in plt/collects/help/manuals.ss, 
 which is listed among your file responsibilities.  Could you add 
 appropriate text?
 
 Thanks ...

 Sure. I put some text there. (The text is actually in plt/collects/help/notthere.htm)

Thanks for the bug report. Unfortunately, we don't have plans to support
proxys in the near future, but help desk now includes instructions for
donwloading and installing the documentation when you must use a
proxy server.
