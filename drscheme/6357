>Description:
If foo is a macro and x is undefined,
then (foo x) generates 
   "send: target [module filename] is not an object for get-admin"
I have to force-quit after that.
This is only if foo is defined in an external file
(defining the module in the same file gives the error
one would like).

Okay i confess i don't understand everything the "syntax"
and "define-syntax" and "syntax-line" do, and maybe i 
should be using "require-for-syntax"
instead of "require", but even so i feel proud for
finding a way to bring down drscheme !-)

>How-To-Repeat:
================ first file =======================
(module bugreportlib mzscheme
  (provide test)  
 
  (define-syntax (test stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ a b)
       (syntax (equal? a b))]))
  
  )
================ second file =======================
(require "bugreportlib.ss")

(test 4 4)  ; #t

"The unbound variable is about to generate"
"drscheme internal error:"
"  send: target is not an object: |bugreportlib.ss| for method: get-admin"
(test a a)

 Excellent job, Ian! :)
 
 This has been fixed in the CVS releases and we will have a v205 release 
 with the fix sometime in Aug.
 
 The bug is in the code that draws the stack trace. In certain 
 situations, it gets confused and tries to draw an arrow on a saved file.
 
 To work around it, you can disable debugging, or put your code in one 
 file.
