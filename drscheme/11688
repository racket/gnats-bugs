>Description:
OS X now appears to have two different "about" boxes, and
one of them has the wrong version number. Specifically, 
the "Help > About DrRacket" one looks normal and fine,
but the "DrRacket > About DrRacket" (way over on the
left) contains only an icon and an incorrect version 
number: for my app, it specifies 5.0.99.4, even though
this is 5.0.99.7.  Perhaps this is an unavoidable or
not-easily-avoidable consequence of the gr2 switch and
won't be visible in the pre-packaged versions, in which 
case I suppose I don't care much.

 I don't think that there should be any hard-wired version number
 anywhere (except for a few windows files that are getting updated by
 the nightly build).  But to verify that, can you grep through the dmg
 and see if there's any "5.0.99.4" anywhere?

 Actually, it's in the first place I looked: the Info.plist file inside =
 the DrRacket.app directory. I wonder if this could be related to my =
 recent habit of making using
 
 make plain-install
 
 followed by=20
 
 raco setup -D
 
 .
 
 I looked in plt/src/build/gracket, and both of the Info.plist files =
 there had the problem. Running 'make' again didn't fix it, but deleting =
 those subdirectories and running 'make' did. It looks to me like the =
 part of the makefile that creates GRacket3m.app and Starter.app--I never =
 did find them--is missing a dependence on the version number, somehow.
