Hit run.  Get the error:

 I see two options to deal with this:
 
 * Protect the code that initializes the namespace, so that it still
   ends up inside the module.
 
 * Detect when the namespace was modifies, and leave it alone so you'll
   end up in the namespace that you explicitly change into.
 
 I think that the first option makes more sense because IMO the
 intention of the module language is to work in the context of your
 module.
 
 [I could see an argument for the second: you want side effects
 to be done, just like changing the namespace on the module language's
 repl doing what it's supposed to do -- so if it's in the definitions
 window it should still have it's effect.  But my counter argument for
 this would be that
 
   (current-namespace blah)
   (define x 1)
 
 is inherently different on a working repl and inside a module body.]
 
 Anyway, I've committed this change, and added tests for it.  Note the
 second test -- when you have this:
 
   #lang scheme/base
   (current-namespace (make-base-empty-namespace))
 
 The repl is still usable, because you're not in the empty namespace.

 Looks good to me.
