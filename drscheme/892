 Can you send a complete program, please? I tried to reproduce this with my own
 definition of maxer and failed. Are you sure that you didn't have any windows
 open?

 (define (maxer l)
   (cond
     ((empty? (rest l)) (first l))
     (else (max (first l) (maxer (rest l))))))
 
 Low and behold, I restarted drScheme and it runs now ...

 I am going to guess that you ran low on memory (which can cause such
 wierd bugs, I believe) and leave it at that....

 Wait, now I am confused. Did you get the bug to reproduce or not?
 
 I assumed that you didn't reproduce the bug which led me to conjecture
 that the original bug was due to memory problems.

 When I encountered the bug for the first time, I had just started
 DrScheme. Then I did it several times. I sent email ... And now 
 it's gone.
