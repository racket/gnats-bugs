>Description:
create program and teachpack in two tabs 
teachpack should have an error in it 
go to program tab and add teachpack via teachpack dialog
run and watch error happen 
go to teachpack tab and fix error 
go back to program tab and run: ERROR still there
clear the teachpack 
add it back in and run: ERROR still there 

This isn't acceptable. When I fix an error in a teachpack 
like that, I should get the new version. (It used to be 
like that.)

 When you add the teachpack, it gets copied. You have to remove and
 re-add it. I know it used to be that way and I know that you've asked
 for it to be changed and I know that I've agreed to change it and I
 know I haven't done that yet.
 
 Do we really need a PR for this?

 How do you remove a teachpack? Manually from the directory?
 
 
 > Do we really need a PR for this?
 
 
 You forgot and I forgot that I had talked to you.

 Sorry -- you need to redo the "add teachpack to list" step. That's
 where the copying happens.

 I don't think I forgot anything. Certainly not anything I've written
 about in this PR.
 
 I'm fine wth keeping this PR, tho -- now it will be in at least two
 places (my TODO list and this PR).
