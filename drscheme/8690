>Description:
Would it be possible to change the REPL in drscheme/htdp 
so that typing in the name of a beginner primitive would
print the contract and the purpose statement: 

For example: 

> append 
((listof any) (listof any) (listof any) ... -> (listof any))
"to create a single list from several, by juxtaposition of the items"

I think this could be extremely helpful for beginners.

 Matthew: this looks like a job for struct printing, maybe?

 Definitely not a job for drscheme. It might possibly require hep from
 the teaching languages tool maintainer (ie, me), but probably only a
 little bit.
 
 I would start with mzscheme printing parameters and struct-procedures.

 Since Matthew maintains those, you should assign him the bug report :-)
 
 If I have time, I will look into this, but somehow your response
 looks wrong. I wouldn't want to see these responses in mzscheme
 at all.

 Your response dones't make sense to me either, so I think we're just
 not communicating.
 
 My only point is that drscheme *definitely* shouldn't be involved in
 any language's printer.

 If I am suggesting that the help message show up only in a drscheme
 context, it kind of implies that it is a job for the dr. But if you
 say it is not, I will have to buy it. Perhaps I am wrong and the
 poor chap who runs Beginner in the Unix repl or in Emacs should see
 the docs, too. -- Matthias

 It just doesn't make any sense for drscheme to have ANY
 teacing-language-specific code.

 PS: this seems like one of those "fun things to spend an afternoon on"
 but I think I've exhausted that quota with the stick figures ...

Responsible changed from "matthias" to "mflatt" by matthias at Wed, 25 Jul 2007 10:13:30 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew, you never passed judgement on this issue, so I figured I'd 
get something out of you by assigning you the report.
