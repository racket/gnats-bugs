When debugging the Step button only responds to the first click. There is no 
response if it's clicked again, unless I move the mouse pointer away from the

1) Open file
2) Click Debug -- [Green arrow appears]
3) Click Step -- [Green arrow advances]
4) Click Step again without moving mouse -- [No effect]
