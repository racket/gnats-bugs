>Description:
Hi, I'm having a very strange problem with Dr.Racket. 
Everytime I want to run something in the interactions area, and press ENTER...Nothing happens!

For example, I was writing along with the 4.d) video lecture and when I tried to do as Prg. Gregor (13:35) that he runs the program to see if it is working and he types (main 0) in the interactions area and a blank empty screen appears....well: that's not happening with my Dr. Racket.

I've noticed this earlier (that when calling a function it wouln't produce anything) but I was too busy to pay attention to it but now I now there is something wrong.

I'm using Dr. Racket on Linux Mint 14 "Nadia" (MATE) edition.

Any idea of what could this be?
>How-To-Repeat:
 - get a new tab
 - in the definitions area put (define (foo x) (* 2 x))
 - press Run
 - go to the interactions area
 - type (foo 2) and press return/enter

The resulto would be that nothing happens. Nothing shows nor in the interactions or definitions area.

 When you say "nothing happens", do you literally mean there is no response,
 or do you see the insertion point moving to the next line and DrRacket just
 not evaluating your expression?
 
 When you push the return/enter key, do you hold down any modifier keys, or
 do you just push the one key? Are you pushing the key on the numeric keypad
 or on the main portion of your keyboard (if it has such a thing)?

 Thanks.
 
 The bug report you sent in says that you are using version 5.3.5 but the
 screenshot says you are using 5.2.1. Do you experience this problem in both
 versions?

 *** Description:<br>
 Hi, I&#39;m having a very strange problem with Dr.Racket.<br>
 Everytime I want to run something in the interactions area, and press ENTER=
 ...Nothing happens!<br>
 <br>
 For example, I was writing along with the 4.d) video lecture and when I tri=
 ed to do as Prg. Gregor (13:35) that he runs the program to see if it is wo=
 rking and he types (main 0) in the interactions area and a blank empty scre=
 en appears....well: that&#39;s not happening with my Dr. Racket.<br>
 
 
 
 <br>
 I&#39;ve noticed this earlier (that when calling a function it wouln&#39;t =
 produce anything) but I was too busy to pay attention to it but now I now t=
 here is something wrong.<br>
 <br>
 I&#39;m using Dr. Racket on Linux Mint 14 &quot;Nadia&quot; (MATE) edition.=
 <br>
 <br>
 Any idea of what could this be?<br>
 <br>
 *** How to repeat:<br>

 What happens if you do hold down some modifier keys? Try control return and
 alt return. Also, if you have a keypad, please also do try that return.
 
 As some background, the missing piece for me is how your version of the
 operating system is sending the keypresses to DrRacket. I'm sorry I don't
 have a direct way to help you (which I would if I were sitting at your
 machine (probably)).

 Yeah, I guessed that there was a non-US keyboard involved already, but I'm

 *** Description:<br>
 Hi, I&#39;m having a very strange problem with Dr.Racket.<br>
 Everytime I want to run something in the interactions area, and press ENTER=
 ...Nothing happens!<br>
 <br>
 For example, I was writing along with the 4.d) video lecture and when I tri=
 ed to do as Prg. Gregor (13:35) that he runs the program to see if it is wo=
 rking and he types (main 0) in the interactions area and a blank empty scre=
 en appears....well: that&#39;s not happening with my Dr. Racket.<br>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <br>
 I&#39;ve noticed this earlier (that when calling a function it wouln&#39;t =
 produce anything) but I was too busy to pay attention to it but now I now t=
 here is something wrong.<br>
 <br>
 I&#39;m using Dr. Racket on Linux Mint 14 &quot;Nadia&quot; (MATE) edition.=
 <br>
 <br>
 Any idea of what could this be?<br>
 <br>
 *** How to repeat:<br>
 =C2=A0- get a new tab<br>
 =C2=A0- in the definitions area put (define (foo x) (* 2 x))<br>
 =C2=A0- press Run<br>
 =C2=A0- go to the interactions area<br>
 =C2=A0- type (foo 2) and press return/enter<br>
