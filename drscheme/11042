>Description:
non-integers in BSL are printed as snips; copying these 
into the definitions window pastes a snip rather than 
text, so that the resulting number is rendered in black 
and cannot be edited (just deleted).

Discovered by a TSRJ participant
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new window, set language to BSL using language 
menu.

Run this program:

(* 0.4 0.6)

Copy and paste the 0.24 from the interactions window into 
the definitions window.  Note that it's pasted as black 
text, and furthermore that it's impossible to place the 
cursor within the number (say, after the period).

 Matthew: any ideas what the right thing is here? I can convert them
 back to Scheme notation (using fractions in some cases) but would it
 be better to try to make the snip actually be editable somehow?
