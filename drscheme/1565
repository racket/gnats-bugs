>Description:
Since issuing the command line 

   drscheme record.ss

brings up a new DrScheme window containing record.ss, ready to edit,
one expects that

   drscheme database.prj

(where database.prj is a project file created within DrScheme) will
bring up the project window corresponding to that file.  Instead, it
opens a DrScheme window containing database.prj, ready to edit as
a normal text file.

If this is, in fact, the desired behavior (!), I couldn't find it
documented anywhere.

 It is not desired, per se, but it is what you get, since there is no
 way for drscheme to know that that is project file. I should do
 something about that and probably will for the next release. 
 
 Thanks for pointing it out.
