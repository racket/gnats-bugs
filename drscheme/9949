>Description:
S-expression highlighting doesn't work when the Definitions window is split
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a new Definitions and Interactions window.
2. Type '(define x 10)' into Definitions.
3. Place the cursor just past the closing bracket.
4. Verify highlighting works.
5. Hit C:m. The s-expr is highlighted in both windows
6. Move focus to a single window, and then the other. In both cases, highlighting doesn't work.
>Fix:
