>Description:
Start DrScheme 

Add teachpack "arrow.ss" 

Here is the error message you get:
  
  unit: duplicate import name at: make-posn in: (#%unit (import check-arg check-arity...

But arrow doesn't link in posn's ... 

;; --- 

Furthermore, DrScheme says that the teachpack was added after
you click on ok but the REPL doesn't know about the functions 
in the teachpack.

I have fixed this portion of the PR:

> in the teachpack. 

and I believe that this is the only portion of the PR that needs anything
done.
