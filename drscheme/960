>Description:
DrScheme's command-line history processing seems to be broken.
See How-to-Repeat below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Enter expressions 'a, then 'b, then 'c
Exit DrScheme
Start DrScheme
ESC-P and ESC-N seem to do the right thing
Enter 'd
Again, ESC-P seems to do the right thing, but ESC-N
 seems to skip over 'd or replace it with empty
Exit DrScheme
Start DrScheme
ESC-P and ESC-N work again, including the 'd entry
