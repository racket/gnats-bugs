 This bug boils down to setting current-directory to a directory that  
 doesn't exist. I would think that such a runtime check would be in  
 place to enforce the invariant that current-directory is never set to a  
 directory that doesn't exist, but that doesn't seem like an invariant  
 that's possible to provide. For example, if you start up in some  
 directory and then rmdir that directory, you can get this:
 
  > (current-directory)
 "/Users/robby/t2"
  > (current-directory (current-directory))
 current-directory: directory not found or not a directory:  
 "/Users/robby/t2"
 
 Anyways, based on all that, I would say that mzscheme shouldn't be  
 signalling an error in this case (ie, it's a bad contract :).
 
 Can mz be changed?

 Technically, there's a problem with Mac OS Classic. The path given to
 `current-directory' is expanded, and under Mac OS Classic, expansion
 checks for aliases and revolves them like soft links. It's possible,
 then, that the result of `(current-directory)' can produce an error
 during path expansion.
 
 On other platforms, though, expansion and simplification together
 produce a path that is a fix-point for expansion or simplification.
 Given that we don't support Mac OS Classic anymore, it looks like
 skipping the `current-directory' check would make `(current-directory
 (current-directory))' always ok, and I'll try this change.
 
 I think it's best to wait until after v206, though. I worry that I may
 be overlooking something.

 But this seems different that the error being signaled above -- the
 error above is that the argument to current-directory does not exist,
 right?

 I totally agree with this. I already put in a check for
 directory-exists? in drscheme's repl code. It doesn't handle all
 situations (since it's not really "thread safe") but it gets the easy
 ones.

 It's a different error, but the fundamental problem is that
 
    (current-directory (current-directory))
 
 can produce an error, right? Even without the exists check, taht
 expression could produce an error under Mac OS Classic.
