 Do you also have to use the program while it's running? Or does it leak 
 by itself, just sitting there?
 
 I ask because this might be a duplicate of 12228:
 
      http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=12228
 
 In that one, clicking on tabs leaks memory, about 1/2 MB per click.
 
 If you do have to use DrRacket to make it leak memory, could you try 
 some of the latest tests spelled out there? Search for "Action:" 
 (without the quotes).
