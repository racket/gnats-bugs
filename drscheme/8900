>Description:
In DrScheme, if the preferences window is the last visible window to be closed, the DrScheme (mred) process does not terminate.

I observed the problem on a Linux system. I have not tried it on Windows. On Mac OS X it wouldn't be a problem anyway because the application is supposed to survive the closing of all of its windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.
Open the preferences window.
Switch back to the main DrScheme window, and close it.
Now close the preferences window.
The underlying mred process is still alive, but there is no means of interacting with it.
>Fix:
The preferences window was not playing nicely with the various callbacks on frames (and this broke groups, which broke exiting).

The fix is to jsut make sure that on-close and can-close? were being called when the preferences window was closed, ie to use the `close' method instead of directly calling `show'. (This caused a little rejiggering, of course.)

 This seems to work for me under linux.
 
 Do you get the "do you want to quit" dialog box?
 
 Does it work if you move your preferences file out of the way (and
 restart drscheme)?

 No. In my original configuration, "Verify exit" was unchecked.

 I moved my whole .plt-prefs directory out of the way. Same behavior.
 
 While trying it out again, though, I think I discovered why we're
 getting different behavior. If you close the preferences window by
 clicking the X button on the title bar, then it *does* quit DrScheme
 (and I do get the dialog box). But if you close the preferences window
 by clicking either "OK" or "Cancel", then it does not quit. (It doesn't
 seem to matter how you close the first window.) Sorry I didn't make that
 clear the first time.

 AH, I get it now.
 
 So .. (to both you and Matthew): at the moment, opening the
 preferences dialog for the first time is slower than in later times.
 That's because the dialog doesn't really go away when its closed -- it
 is just hidden.
 
 How important is it to preserve that? If I get rid of it, that makes
 it easy to fix this bug, but I suspect preserving that behavior will
 be tricky (but doable, if it is worth it).
 
 Opinions?

 Would that mean that the procedures passed to 'preferences:add-panel' 
 would be called every time the preferences window is shown, rather than 
 just once? That could conceivably break existing code. But it's 
 probably easy to fix that, too.
 
 That's the only issue that comes to mind at the moment.

 Yes.

 The performance one is the one I'm worried about.
