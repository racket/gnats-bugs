>Description:
A blind student tells me that Dr. Racket doesn't work well with Jaws for Windows, which he says is the defacto standard screen reader software for Windows. Racket itself (command line) works fine, but Dr Racket seems to use custom window classes.

Have you encountered this problem? Is there a standard suggestion for the student to follow?
