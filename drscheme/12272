>Description:
When printing the definitions window using the File \ Print Definitions... menu, only the first page prints.

(Tried with several printers, one networked, one local, one fake (PDF converter) and had the same consistent error.)

This is all on Windows 7 w/DrRacket 5.1.3 using plai (though I also repro'd with #lang racket).

(Also tried adjusting margins from all 0 to all 10mm; resulted in a single page that was entirely blank.)
>How-To-Repeat:
a. Create a definitions window with sufficient text to run past a page.  (In repro, I used 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 each on its own line, pasted many times, with a #lang racket line at the top.)  

b. Print the definitions window.  (Hit Ctrl-P or Select Print Definitions from the File menu; both have worked for me.)

c. Print to some printer.

Result is a single page of output.
