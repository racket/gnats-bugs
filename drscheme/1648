>Description:
(Apologies if this is a duplicate report; I had some difficulties
the first time I tried to submit it.)

When I press the "Check Syntax" button in a DrScheme window, it
keeps the input focus, and I have to explicitly click in the
definitions or interaction pane to continue typing.

Not a show-stopper, but still annoying.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load any random Scheme file into a DrScheme window.  Click
"Check Syntax".  Keep typing; watch nothing appear in either pane.

(But you could have figured that out. <grin>)

 That is how all buttons work on that platform.

 Lo, on Friday, 8 September, 2000, Robert Bruce Findler did write:

 Well,
 
 1) If that were true, it'd still be annoying.
 
 2) My experience, however, suggests otherwise:
 
    * Save: after you click it, it goes away, so it can't keep the input
      focus.  Instead, it sends the input focus to the definitions window,
      which is the Right Thing.
 
    * Step: it does keep the input focus, but this is somewhat less
      annoying, since it brings up a separate window.
 
    * Execute: sends the keyboard input focus to the interactions window,
      which is also the Right Thing.
 
    * Break: sends the input focus in the definitions window, which is
      probably also the Right Thing.
 
 I don't have MrSpidey or any of the other add-ons installed, so I can't
 check those.

 Sorry. I should have said "that is the default behavior on that 
 platform". Note that is also the default behavior under Windows.
 
 I just changed it so the focus goes to the definitions. committed and 
 tagged in CVS.
