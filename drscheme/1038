>Description:
When I supply multiple filenames on the command-line, DrScheme seems
to handle them fine if the files exist. When the files do not exist,
I get bizarrely incorrect and inconsistent results.

>How-To-Repeat:
; Assume that one, two, three, four, five, and six do not exist
% drscheme one
; I get 1 window named "Untitled"; should have been 1 window named "one"
% drscheme one two three
; I get 2(!) windows, one named "Untitled" and one named "two"
% drscheme one two three four five six
; Once I got 4 windows all named "Untitled"
; Once I got five windows, 4 "Untitiled"s and 1 "five"

fixed, released. There was a funny interaction between the first-opened
special case in the code and files that didn't exist.
