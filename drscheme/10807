 This is a symptom of a larger bug where the search window gets
 confused about where it is searching, I think.
 
 Until I find time to fix it, I think that you can click in the
 definition/interactions window and then click back into the search
 window to get things back in sync.
 
 Sorry,
 Robby

 I looked into this and couldn't seems to make this happen reliably. I
 fixed one possible problem, changing how the anchor works in this
 situations. Specifically, when you switch tabs, you lose the anchor in
 the old editor and gain an anchor at the insertion point in the new
 one.
 
 Does that seem like a useful thing? (You may have already had that
 semantics, but now you get the anchor actually being drawn.)

Reason>>> seems to work now.
