>Description:
I saw slidey in the make-zo's scrolling by, so
I gave it a whirl.  I haven't been able to play it
so far.  I put my cursor on the square just above the
space in bottom-right, and drag down.  If I just
move it over the white space, nothing happened.
If I move my mouse further, over the window border,
I get

vector-ref: index 6 out of range [0, 5] for vector: #6(#<struct:loc> #<struct:loc> #<struct:loc> #<...
