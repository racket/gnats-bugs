>Description:
I have downloaded DrScheme twice now, once from Tubingen and once from
Rice. In both cases the result is the same. The loading and expansion
process seems to work without problems or any intervention from me. When
I then double-click on the DrScheme icon to start, I get the "Standard 
"Output" window with the message
 require-library: collection not found: "drscheme" in any of: ( )
It is not possible to do anything to make DrScheme run, as far as I can 
see.

MrEd runs OK.

The DrScheme icon shows a green component (small thick arrow?) at its
bottom right. Maybe this indicates that something is incomplete after
downloading and expansion? There is no such mark on the MrEd icon.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have just sent this same report with jac@cs.ucl.ac.uk as my email address.
I could not show 2 email addresses in the email field, hence this second
copy. I'll be grateful if any technical response can go to both my
email addresses (in England and Brazil).

 Oops, I didn't read your bug report carefully.  I assumed 
 you were running under Windows, not the Mac.  So ignore
 what I said about the environment variable PLTHOME.  But uninstalling first,
 wiping out everything, and re-installing is still good advice.
 
 Does that help?
 
 What version of MacOS are you running?
