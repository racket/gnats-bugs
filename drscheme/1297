 Although I found some source code that could trigger that error, I
 could not reproduce it in my installation. So, I just changed the code
 and we will hope for the best. I put a note to that effect in the notes
 for the next release, so perhaps you can try it again at that time?
 
 I will close this pr when I release.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
