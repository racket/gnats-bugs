>Description:
I cannot use the (module ...) language level in DrScheme to test a language with a restricted set of values for #%datum because it adds a (#%datum . #<void>) to my program somewhere.

Take the two modules below for example.  The first defines a very simple language which restricts literals to numbers.  The second defines a module in this language which includes three literal numbers.

Save the two modules as bug-lang.ss and bug-prog.ss.  Now load bug-prog.ss in the "Textual" language level.  Run it, require the module, whatever, it works just fine.  Uncomment the "asdf" line and it correctly raises an error because "asdf" is not a number.

Now load bug-prog.ss in the (module ...) language level (with "asdf" commented out as it was initially).  Now it gives the error:

#%datum: bad syntax in: (#%datum . #<void>)
>How-To-Repeat:
(module bug-lang mzscheme

  (define-syntax (bug-datum stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(dat . thing)
       (number? (syntax-e (syntax thing)))
       (syntax/loc stx (#%datum . thing))]))

  (provide
   #%module-begin
   [rename bug-datum #%datum])
  )

(module bug-prog (file "bug-lang.ss")

  ;"asdf"
  1
  2
  3
  )
>Fix:
There was an extra (#%eval ...) that didn't belong. That is, there was generated code that was generated wrong.
>Release-Note:
This was, in some sense, a contract violation, but not one with precise blame.

Not a type error.
