>Description:
The text mode browser employed by Help Desk auto-wraps text,
sometimes trying to be clever.  This is a bad idea.  Text should be
assumed to be pre-formatted, and thus left unmolested.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Help Desk, search for "url" and choose the net collection doc.txt.
Beneath the URL struct field description is a sample URL.
Make your window narrow enough.
The line containing the URL is split after the "-" in "cgi-bin".
The next line (with anchor numbers) is also split, though of course differently.
The result is a mess.

By the same token, please now try to keep the lines in the doc.txt file
down around 70 characters. In the net doc.txt, the send-mail-message line
is very long...
