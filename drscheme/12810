>Description:
When running a program with ctrl-r in drracket, other modules required by the program are taken from the files on disk, ignoring copies of these modules open and modified in other drracket edit buffers and not saved.

A friendlier approach would be to ask the user if he wants to save the modified buffers containing required modules, before rebuilding.
