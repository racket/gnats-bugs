>Description:
Open a new drracket in a fresh directory (or something like /tmp).

Enter the following program:
#lang racket
(require plot)
line

Hit check syntax.
Right-click on `line' and select jump to defintion.  This will open "collects/plot/deprecated.rkt", and run check syntax on it.

Then right click on "line-renderer" in the definition of `line', and select jump to definition.  You get an error like this ("/home/samth/tmp" is where this drracket instance was started):

normalize-path: #<path:/home/samth/tmp/deprecated> (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist

 FWIW, I've seen this too before this and I couldn't make a small
 example that would work outside of drracket, but it seems like somehow
 the module-path-index that is just a relative path is sometimes
 resolved against some old version of the current-directory (or
 current-load-relative-path or whatever it is resolved against).
