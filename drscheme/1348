>Description:
When a thread printing stuff out is shutdown by a custodian, it
stops printing as it should.  However, the GC blinks on and off
repeatedly while the total memory usage increases wo bound.  CPU
usage is high, too.  This only appeared to be a problem in DrScheme,
but not in mzscheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute this:

;; serve : -> Custodian 
(define (serve)
  (let ([cust (make-custodian)])
    (parameterize ([current-custodian cust])
      (thread old-serve))
    cust))

;; old-serve : -> doesn't
(define (old-serve) (let l () (printf "hi~n") (l)))

Then in the Repl run:
(define x (serve))
(custodian-shutdown-all x)

 When I run this program:
 
 (define (serve)
   (let ([cust (make-custodian)])
     (parameterize ([current-custodian cust])
       (thread old-serve))
     cust))
 (define (old-serve) (let l ([n 0]) (printf "hi ~a~n" n) (l (+ n 1))))
 (define x (serve))
 (begin (sleep 1)
        (custodian-shutdown-all x))
 
 (all in the definitions window), there doesn't seem to be any problem.
 
 When I tried to run things in the interactions window, as you pr originally
 states, I cannot even type anything. So, I am adding a "Kill" menu item,
 like break, except that it kills all of the threads/custodians, doesn't just
 break the main thread.
