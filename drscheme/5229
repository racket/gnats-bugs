>Description:
The "related web sites" menu doesn't work.
I can try any of the entries in the menu and all I get is an empty
netscape window (that's netscape 4.75 under solaris). No error message
is displayed. Just a blank window, as if the URL was not given to netscape.

Also, if I already have netscape open, I get an annoying warning
about the netscape cache being locked. Maybe there's a command line
netscape option that could be added to get rid of that warning ?

>How-To-Repeat:
Try one of the "related web sites" menu entries.

 This is a bug in your window manager -- it should bring the netscape 
 window to the front :)
 
 Perhaps only in the netscape case I should do that? I think that in 
 my setup, I automatically get put over to the opera window. I will 
 double check tho.
 
 It sounds like Philippe is having a bigger problem, tho. Maybe two 
 netscapes on his path or something. I will have to check it out when 
 I'm in Boston.

 Oh, mozilla? Perhaps there are different commandline options to use
 then? I guess that in the mozilla case, it's actually calling netscape
 to send the message? Perhaps if you added this:
 
   -raise
 
 before the -remote commandline option, you might have better luck?
 
 This page has more details, but I didn't see anything interesting.

 Mozzila pretends to be netscape when the launcher program looks for a
 netscape. (It works fine.)
