>Description:
DrScheme fails to load a file I saved earlier today when I was interrupted while working on a snip definition.  (The file defines and installs a snipclass, which would have been present while I was working on it earlier; that's the only way I can think it might have influenced the global DrScheme environment.)  The error message follows:
insert-file in text%: error loading the file

 This is indeed a bug we fixed in svn. The head svn should be able to  
 load.
