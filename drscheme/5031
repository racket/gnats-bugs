 It isn't intended to! Do you mean this as a change-request?

 Sure, this can be a change-request.  I suppose the real difference is 
 whether you regard the contour as a tool that the user controls to 
 jump to specific locations, or a high-level view that shows you where 
 you are in the file.  I think I regard it as the latter, and am thus 
 surprised when the blue box leaves the visible region.

 Well, it has its own scroll bar and clicking on it sends the main 
 window to that portion in the file. So, there is some non-trivial 
 interaction between what you ask for and what it already does.

 I don't think it's a killer, but I may be overlooking something.  For 
 the record, I'll summarize what I believe to be the correct behavior 
 from some kind of horrible UML-type spec, and then I'll just let it 
 drop.  It's not something I really care about a whole bunch.
 
 behavior of the defn's window:
 
 1) when the beginning and ending of the definitions window change (in 
 file position), tell the contour window to highlight that region. 
 (already implemented)
 
 2) when the contour window tells the definitions window to move, 
 move. (already implemented)
 
 behavior of the contour window:
 
 1) when the user clicks in the contour window, tell the def'ns window 
 to move. (already implemented)
 
 2) when the def'ns window tells the contour window to highlight a 
 region, highlight it.  -> If the new region is not visible, scroll it 
 so it is visible. <-  Doesn't the search window already implement 
 this w.r.t. the def'ns & interactions window?
 
 Anyhow, that's it.  You can close this if it doesn't look good to you.
