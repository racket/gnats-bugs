I don't get it. Can you be more clear?

 Change the will-executor in the user's parameterization. Create
 a new one each time.
 
 Matthew

I'm not sure why creating a new will-executor helps the problem -- that
display will still happen, right? I need to somehow change the
parameterization the only will-executor will run in or something?

A will executor's wills are only executed if `will-executor-try' is
applied to the executor or asynchronously when the executor is the
current executor for some [still-running, possibly blocked] thread.
By creating a new will executor with each REP for the user's
parameterization, no wills are installed into the DrScheme
implementation executor and executors from previous REPs will never
have a chance to execute wills (and they'll be GCed along with their
wills). Thus, creating a new executor each time fixes the above bug.
