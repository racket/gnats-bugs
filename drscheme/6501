>Description:
(i.e. -> plt-prefs.ss) as on it appears to accumulate historical garbage
preference entries, from successive versions of DrScheme over time, and
is occasionally nice to be able to purge/clean if of obsolete entries
more easily by not having to open it from the terminal window. (not a
big deal, just a thought)

Responsible-Changed-From-To: eli->nobody
Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 05:08:56 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:20:12 -0500
Reason>>> Robby, I think that either you or Matthew had a discussion 
on this.  So if things changed or if you decided not to 
change, then this should be closed.
Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Sat, 03 Apr 2004 19:16:42 -0500
Reason>>> Matthew has changed the name already, I believe.
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 02 Jun 2004 13:11:47 -0400
Reason>>> Moved for v299.
