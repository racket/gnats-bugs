>Description:
DrScheme prevents the user from editing locked files on the mac,
but it doesn't change the "Unlocked" label to "Locked".
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new file, save it, close it, change to finder, select file,
Get Info (cmd-I), click "Locked" check box, change to DrScheme, 
open file.  Voila! Cannot edit file, but label still says 
"Unlocked".

There was a bug left over from when I changed this from an icon to
text. Apparetnly, this was not well tested at the time.
