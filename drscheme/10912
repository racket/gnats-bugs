>Description:
It appears that the "Scribble HTML" button generates the 
html file in the directory in which the scribble file 
lives, but then tries to open it in the current directory
of the DrRacket process.  
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open new window
2) Paste this program
#lang scribble/doc

@(require scribble/manual)

@title{Wubba Wubba}

3) save in /tmp/foo.scrbl
4) click Scribble HTML button, get this error:

" [Output to /private/tmp/foo.html]
The file /Users/clements/foo.html does not exist.
