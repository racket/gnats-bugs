>Description:
I think the `Search' menu in Help Desk ought to go away
(on the general principle of removing anything that is not
useful).

But if it stays, then the menu items should only be enabled
when then `Search' button is enabled.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start Help Desk
  (don't type a help string)
Select the `Search' menu item - it searches on ""
  In contrast, the "Search" button is not enabled
