You get N copies of the browser

the resources that this program allocates.

(define b (make-object mx-browser% "hello world" 300 300))

 this should be a better way to reproduce the problem. Run the program
 below:
 
 (define cust (make-custodian))
 (define killer (make-object frame% "killer"))
 (make-object button% "kill" killer (lambda x (custodian-shutdown-all cust))
 (send killer show #t)
 
 (define (run)
   (parameterize ([current-custodian cust])
     (thread
       (lambda ()
          ...matthias's program ...))))
 
 ;; call run any number of times:
 (run) (run) (run)
 
 Then, clicking on the kill button should kill all of the windows, no
 matter how many times (run) is invoked.
 
 If you get the above working, then DrScheme should also work.

 My question is, how can DrScheme know about MysterX resources?
 To DrScheme, MysterX is an arbitrary extension that can do
 arbitrary things.  So what is the bug?
 
 Now, MysterX could remove a browser window when the corresponding
 mx-browser% object is garbage-collected.  But I'm not sure 
 that's what users would expect/want, since the occurrence of 
 garbage-collection is unpredictable.
 
 As an experiment, I created a let-bound frame% object inside
 DrScheme (under Solaris, but that shouldn't matter).  When the let had 
 finished, I ran collect-garbage.  The window corresponding to the frame 
 remained.

 No gc-ing shouldn't do it. 
 
 But I thought we could place these windows into the custodian and have
 things shut down that way.

 Technically, this is a bug in MysterX because MysterX allocates OS
 resources (in this case a window) but doesn't register it with the
 current-eventspace (this probably not explained as a requirement in the
 mzscheme manual anywhere, but you can see that it is a problem for
 DrScheme). It is possible to break mzscheme arbitrarily with extensions
 -- this is just one of the many ways :)
