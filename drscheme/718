(This is an old bug, but I couldn't find an existing PR. Apologies
if a PR already exists.)

The "Undo" menu item will attempt to undo past setup steps in the
interactions window. It's usually merely annoying, since 
character insertions and deletions are disallowed. However, it is
possible to introduce weird fonts in uneditable text.

The solution is simply to flush all undo information when Execute
is hit.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Change the program to a single identified: a (DON'T hit execute)
Eval 10 in the REPL; you get a warning and the answer 10
Hit Execute; error message because a is not bound
Go to the interactions window:
 Undo once: > prompt turns red and italic
 Undo again: > prompt turns bold with yellow background
