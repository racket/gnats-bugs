>Description:
I don't know how, but I somehow had this option turned on, and was
surprised at how useless it is...

* Every time I save a file, it will as me about saving it in text format
  even when it's all text.

* One problem with that dialog is that when the question is presented, you
  have no way to cancel the save.  This is very weird for a GUI behavior.

* And I did try answering "no" once -- and when the file is modified and
  re-saved, it asks me the same question *again*.  Answering "no" again
  will mean another question next time.

The least it should do is remember the decision and not ask a second
time.  In short -- do what the description says, and ask only when the
format changes.  I'd also vote for the first save to not be considered a
format change.

But my even stronger vote is to just eliminate this option completely.  I
don't see any use for saving a file in WXME format when it's all text, or
any use for throwing an error when you want to save a non-text file in a
text format.  So having the option off is always the sensible thing to do.
