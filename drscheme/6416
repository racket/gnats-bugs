>Description:
When the main edit field for a document window has the focus, after clicking Check Syntax, it loses its focus. This is a very slight annoyance but it means the scroll-wheel no longer works until you click in the edit field to regain the focus.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Click in the edit field of a document window to gain focus.
2. Click the Check Syntax button.
3. Try to type something or use the scroll-wheel (doesn't work until you click again in the window)

 I don't quite follow this one: what is the "edit field of a document
 window"? Do you mean the definitions window? If so, this doesn't happen
 for me (nor for the interactions window, nor for an io text box).

 Sorry, yes, poorly worded. I did mean the definitions window. Oh, poop. 
 Now I can't reproduce it either. Sorry, I'll have to pay more attention 
 to the context next time it happens.
 
 Apologies...
