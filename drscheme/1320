>Description:
1. Type in xyz in def windows 
2. Click on CheckSyntax 
3. This appears
procedure process-text/zodiac: expects 6 arguments, given 5: #<object> #<procedure> 0 4 #f

(4. The Def windows no longer does cut and paste afterwards. I am not
sure this is related but it's an observation.)

Okay and I discovered this after whittling it down from 150 lines of 
code. What a pain.
