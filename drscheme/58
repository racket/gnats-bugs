Check syntax on the program 

        (a . b)	

in DrScheme produces:
Internal Error: exn-message: expects type <struct:exn> as 1st arg; given #(struct:zodiac-exn "Invalid improper-list syntax" #(struct:location 42 13 1156 #<object:wx:media-edit%>) #(struct:location 42 27 1170 #<object:wx:media-edit%>) static) (type <struct>)

 In the textual version, I get
 
 e> (a . b)
 
 Error at: #(struct:improper-list #(struct:origin source source)
 #(struct:location 1 1 0 nofile) #(struct:location 1 7 6 nofile)
 (#(struct:symbol #(struct:origin source source) #(struct:location 1 2
 1 nofile) #(struct:location 1 2 1 nofile) a a ()) #(struct:symbol
 #(struct:origin source source) #(struct:location 1 6 5 nofile)
 #(struct:location 1 6 5 nofile) b b ())) 2 #(struct:period
 #(struct:location 1 4 3 nofile)) ())
 syntax-error: Invalid improper-list syntax
 
 which means M3 is probably raising the right kind of error.  Also, I
 don't create anything called zodiac-exn.  Maybe you forgot to put a
 `zodiac-exn?' in a with-handlers somewhere?

 I don't know what time I'll be in tomorrow and I won't be home either,
 so I thought I'd give you some information in the hope you could make
 sense out of it.

 Ah. I think I know what's going on. Check Syntax doesn't handle errors
 right, currently. I am cleaning that up tonight, actually.
