>Description:
The documentation for front-end/complete-program and front-end/interaction in drscheme:language:language<%> say that their second argument is "a value representing the source of the program", and their third argument is the current settings for the language. The second argument, however, does not exist, meaning that, as far as I can tell, there is no straightforward way for either function to get access to the editor (for example, to highlight the position of an error).

While this is technically a documentation bug, in this case, I would prefer if the documentation was correct. Would it be possible to allow the front-end methods to access the source editor? Or is there another way to do that which I'm not aware of?

 The editor is the `object-name' of the port. 
 
 (Again, I'll work on the docs. Thanks.)
