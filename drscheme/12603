>Description:
If Check Syntax is used, the "Copy" menu option from the menu bar is grayed out and no longer works.  Right-clicking the selection shows that it's still possible to copy-and-paste.

This is also problematic when online expansion is enabled, and a file is expanding properly (green light), then right clicking no longer displays copy-and-paste options either.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrRacket.

Click the Menu Bar / Edit, and note that Copy is enabled.  Bring focus back to the Definitions window.

Press F6.

Click on the Menu Bar / Edit.  Note that Copy no longer is available.

 I need to specify: this happens when the mouse pointer is hovering
 over an identifier.

 I'm not seeing this behavior (I guess it could be platform-specific and I'm
 trying on a mac, not linux).
 
 Looking at the code, I expect that if nothing is selected, the copy menu
 items are disabled intentionally. Is that perhaps what you're seeing here?
 (There are a few other funny cases where the menus would be disabled -- if
 the editor thinks that you're not supposed to be able to read it, for
 example, but I don't know why it would think that in this case).
 
 Anyways, if that's not it, then it would help to have more step by step
 directions. What do you have in the definitions window? Where exactly do
 you click to select things? Etc.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I'm seeing it in the latest Ubuntu Linux.  Can anyone else verify that
 they see it too?  I'm pretty sure I'm running under a standard setup,
 but just in case...

 No, I don't think so.  The selection is highlighting a region of text,
 so copy should be enabled.

 I started from a clean definitions window with just
 
     #lang racket
 
 in it.
 
 I pressed F6 to do a check syntax, and then dragged a highlight across
 the "#lang racket" portion.  I then moused to the Edit menu, and the
 copy and paste options are still disabled.  Online expansion must be
 on to see the behavior: if it's off, copy and paste works.  So I'm
 pretty sure there's some funny interaction going on between Check
 Syntax and online expansion.

 Thanks. I'm still not seeing it, so I'll give ubuntu a try, but one
 question: is the little circle in the bottom right green when you push
 f6?

 Yes.  This is crucial: the program needs to be well formed for the bug
 to manifest.  If it's not well-formed, then hilariously enough,
 copy-and-paste from the Edit menu is correctly enabled.

 I'm still not seeing this.
 
 I do see something similar, tho: when the mouse is hovering over an
 identifier, and the identifier is selected, then right-click opens a
 menu with only the check syntax menu items; the cut/copy/paste/etc
 menu items are not present at all.
 
 (But going to the edit menu at the top of the window shows an enabled
 Copy menu.)

 FWIW, I've just pushed a fix for the "There is also..." portion of this PR.
