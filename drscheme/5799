>Description:
definitions window with xml box and nested scheme box 
run check syntax 
click Execute 
colors inside of nested Scheme boxes don't go away
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
remember the editors where check syntax changes the
styles and then use that list when undoing the changes.
>Release-Note:
There was no contract violation. There might have been one
(after cleaning, no text has any colors) but it isn't clear that
most people would have written it.
