>Description:
In DrRacket, under certain circumstances the toolbar tool-tips lose their label, usually until DrRacket restart.

Note that the steps below ensure that the toolbar is in the correct location, and that the frame's window is in the correct location, so as to make duplicatiom easier.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket and maximize.
Move toolbar to left side (view->toolbar-move toolbar to left).
Load code as below.
Hover mouse over toolbar item until tool-tip appears.
Launch program.
Move mouse cursor through tool-tip into program's frame.
Observe tool-tip text label disappears although tool-tip itself is still displayed. Now, every time tool-tip is shown, text will not be displayed.

#lang racket/gui

(define f (new frame% [label "Tool-tip problem"]
                      [width 200]
                      [height 200]
                      [x 30]
                      [y 30]))

(send f show #t)

 It seems it is even easier to re-produce as no actual program is necessary;
 just moving the mouse cursor into the tool-tip causes the text label to
 disappear, and that's easier to do when the toolbar is on the left (so that
 the tool-tip appears just to the left of the toolbar item).
 
 Furthermore, when it is created, each DrRacket tab seems to copy the
 toolbar from the current active tab, including the presence or absence of
 the tool-tip labels. The problem as described damages only the tab's own
 toolbar. When the active tab is changed (i.e. switch to another tab, close
 a tab, etc.), the toolbar is changed also.
