>Description:
The read-line function sometimes does not work.  Consider the following source code:

(display "enter a directory name: ")
(define myDirectory (read-line)) ; to ensure it stays a string

The read-line function is supposed to pause for user input until the <enter> key is pressed, but sometimes it seems to 'skip' this and resume the program flow of control.  This binds the variable myDirectory (above- or whatever variable is used) to the empty string.
>How-To-Repeat:
I am not sure if you can replicate it on the first try, but if you repeatedly execute chunks of code containing a read-line call, it will eventually happen.  A fact for my machine is that this bug usually happens on the first read-line call in the program, but works properly thereafter.

STEPS
1) Open the DrScheme editor,
2) type the following code in the bottom window:

   (read-line)

3) press <ENTER>
4) notice- it should pause for user input, but it does not,
5) if this does not happen, then continue to execute chunks of code
   containing a read-line call until it does.

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by dyoo at Wed, 27 Mar 2013 15:55:52 -0400
Reason>>> Cannot reproduce.  Current versions of DrRacket use a dedicated widget to 
handle input, separate from the interaction prompt.
