>Description:
There's a few oddities in the menu state on OS X. Perhaps they exist elsewhere.

When I close all interaction windows, I cannot open the help desk.

When I have the help desk open, and I close all interactions windows, I cannot simply open a new file via "File->Open", as there is no "Open" menu item. However, I can get another help desk from the file menu ("New Help Desk"), and I can "Open Recent" and "Open URL...". Neither of these, however, let me open a file.

If I create a new interactions/editor window, I can then "Open" a file via "File->Open". However, the file that opens does not "take over" the unmodified, "untitled" window that comes up. That is, I have to create a new editor window, open my file, and then close the "untitled" window that is languishing unmolested in the background.

>How-To-Repeat:
I think it's all up above. 

None of this is critical, but I've noticed it for a while, and thought I'd mention it.

Thanks,
Matt
