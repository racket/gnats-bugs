>Description:
See below
>How-To-Repeat:
Make sure that the auto-adjust square brackets preference is on
Start DrScheme
Open preferences dialog
Go to "Editing" -> "Square Bracket", and see that the
 box at the bottom is unchecked
>Fix:
as in pr: initialize the state properly
>Release-Note:
there was no contract violation here. the checkbox's default value was the wrong thing (in some cases).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 01 Nov 2006 23:13:33 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to svn
