>Description:
(as in summary)

and doesn't delete it, so next time drscheme startes up,
it asks if you want to use it.
>How-To-Repeat:
"search in files..." using:
dir: /Applications/plt-cvs/plt/collects
search string: gen-match

match.ss first file found (creates/leaves #match.ss#1#)
close window
close drscheme
re-open drscheme
asks about #match.ss#1#

[also, it still only finds 1/4 gen-match matches? in match.ss?]
>Fix:
I rewrote the threading aspects of the searcher to
use the new cmz libraries in mzscheme.
