Subject: Issues with long file names with Dr. Scheme and Win XP.
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2002 20:48:00 -0500 (EST)


I am not sure if this has come to your attention or not, but...

Today, I allowed someone to use my laptop to write some functions. As a
joke, they saved the file with a very long file name. This file name was
over 200 characters, and therefore was not valid in Dr. Scheme, however,
it was still allowed to save. Because the file was saved with the very
long file name, I was no longer able to open the file menu (I did not
attempt to open other menus), I was unable to use shortcuts such as ctrl+S
and ctrl+O, and I was unable to use close Dr. Scheme normally.

After deleting the file, Dr. Scheme still did not work normally because
although the file was gone, it was still listed as a recent file.

Although there may be another solution, I was forced to uninstall and
reinstall it on my computer.

A friend checked this problem on his computer running UNIX, and he did not
have the same dificulties.



Thank you,

Tim Hawes


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
be sure to trim all filenames to 200 chars
when handing them off to mred's gui primitives.

also, relpace & with && so that menu items show the
ampersands properly.

the first part is a contract violation, but the additional

would have been one.

 The bug is not platform specific. It's due to the 200-char limit on the
 size of a menu label.
 
 Also, I tried naming a file "a&b", and I notice that the "&" gets
 dropped in the menu.

 Yeah, I had assumed so.
