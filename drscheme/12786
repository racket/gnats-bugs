 FWIW, the red highlighting is wrong, but the search actually does find
 something. Hopefully that's useful to you until we get the right
 highlighting fixed.

 Thanks for the quick response :)
 
 I'm not quite sure what "the search actually does find something" means 
 (unless you mean the underlying function doing the searching--whose name I 
 don't know--returns the result), but in the interface the red highlighting 
 is absent and I also get 0 find results (or n if the term appears n times 
 outside comment boxes) listed and cannot step to those results.

 Sorry-- I mean that when you type "control-g" it will go to the next
 occurrence of the search string, even in a comment box. That is, the
 red and then numbers are wrong but otherwise, as far as I can see,
 searching works in comment boxes.

 Got it and confirmed (i.e., both Ctrl-G and next scroll to the phantom 
 location in a large enough file).  That's definitely better than nothing 
 for now!
