>Description:
In Drscheme's "module" language, attempting to provide a
syntax export from the module results in an illegal-use-of-syntax
error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute the following program in the "module" language:

(module demo mzscheme
  (provide lambda))
>Fix:
this is the manifestation of a contract violation. there should have been a test case and there is one now.

 This is only if you re-provide imported syntax, fwiw.
 
 I'm not sure what to do about it, tho.

 I don't think so. I discovered the bug with a simple provide, and the
 following triggers the same error:
 
  (module m mzscheme
    (define-syntax s 5)
    (provide s))

 Hm. This ones didn't!
 
 (module m mzscheme (define-syntax (s x) (syntax 1)) (provide s))
 
 Thanks for the additional test case.

 Is it possible to use `s' below so that it expands into 5?

 No. It's not possible to use `s' in an expression position.

 The bug is fixed now, but I cannot yet close the PR, due to web issues.
