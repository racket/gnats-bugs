>Description:
Currently there is no way to add web links for tools and/or
languages, except adding stuff to the top level of the help
menu.  It would be nice to have the ability to add them --
then a URL associated with a language can be used as a
callback for the displayed language name, a URL associated
with a tool can be added as a link from the about dialog,
and maybe have a way to add entries in the "Related Web
Sites" too.

 things you can do for v202:
 
   - mixin something to Drscheme's frame class and add in items to the
 Help menu (even the related web sites sub menu -- you just have to
 search the menu for it -- beware of foreign language drscheme's if you
 attempt this)
 
   - use the proc version of the tools names to support double clicking
 on the name of the language (that's the way that the "module" language
 comes out in a mono-spaced font, but you can do anything there,
 including setting a callback on the text that visits a url)
 
 that covers everything except the about box. I will add something for
 that one.

 I can add something to add urls there, if you'd like.

 Oh yeah, your're right. Duh. Originally, I was going to add something
 to allow arbitrary messing with the text, but then I thought it would
 be too easy to mess things up (and it woul dbe confusing) so I changed
 it to the current interface.

 So since there is no (simple or even mildly complex) way to get it,
 and since there is no way to add stuff to the text in the about box
 until you add it, and since adding URL's now is also not too great
 when you have to seach menu texts -- and especially since adding a URL
 link is probably something that is useful enough that people will want
 so it is much easier to add this if you don't want them to be able to
 (easily) do whatever they want with the text, due to all this, I think
 that it sounds like my original thing sounds like a good idea?

 I hope you don't mind too much -- I didn't add anything for adding to
 the related web sites menu item (I put it on my list, but it may not
 get to the top for a while). If you feel like doing that, I welcome
 patches (I'll do the docs)
 
 I did add something for tools. If you put:
 
   (define tools-urls (list "url.html"))
 
 in your info.ss file, the about box will link the name of your tool to
 that url.

 Well, of course I don't mind -- I don't think I can mind since I don't
 pay for anything and since I can do it myself...  Anyway, I'll try to
 get to it, but only after a new version that includes this patch is
 out -- I don't want to risk the mess of keeping up two versions
 around...

 So I take it that there is nothing for languages also?  (I don't even
 think it should take me too long to get it done now so I can
 definitely do this also...)

 Do you mean that you are adding a language without a tool? If so, you
 can just make an nop tool to get its name in the about box.

 Well, actually I do that already -- which is something that bothers me
 (the fact that you need a nop tool), but given that every tool has an
 icon in the dialog box makes it logical to make that a link by
 attaching a url to the tool, and the fact that every language has its
 name shown in the interaction makes it logical to make that name be a
 link to a url which is attached to the language.  Obviously, languages
 that have tools will probably have the same url...

 I've downloaded the CVS version (couldn't resist playing with the
 stuff Matthew was talking about today).  Anyway, I've finished the
 part of attaching a URL to a language -- you specify a
 `drscheme-language-urls' in info.ss, and the corresponding urls will
 be used as a call back when you click on the language name.
 Do you want these changes?.

 Sorry for the delay.
 
 I'm thinking that the language web sites sub-menu isn't so good -- for
 example, the EoPL web site is repeated from the tools menu and each of
 the other langauge web sites (for the teaching languages) all go to the
 same place, which is also repeated from the tools menu. 
 
 So, I think it would be better to make the tools menu parallel to the
 general releated websites menu and to get rid of the language menu.
 
 Sound okay?

 Yeah, I thought that it looks a bit too much (both the almost
 identical submenu pair and the inconvenient double submenu nesting).
 So I guess that this is just fine, considering that languages that are
 serious enough to have web pages will probably be serious enough to
 install a tool (at least for the icon -- then come the links...).
