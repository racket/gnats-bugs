 If you do manage figure out how to make it happen, that would be a big help.

 I still don't know what provoked it.
 But now that the error is present, I can make
 it reappear. If  close the error window and moves
 the moves, the error pops up again at the momemt
 it touches the line separating the definition
 window from the interaction window.

 Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. I can't seem to get drs into the state
 where things go wrong, tho. I did change that code recently, so I'm
 pretty sure I know roughly where the bug is ... if only I could see
 how to make it happen ...

 Olin forwarded me a report from one of his students who found the same 
 bug. The student said it happened when he adjusted the size of the 
 interactions window. Here's the email:

 I don't see how this can happen from the code, unless the mouse events
 come in out of order somehow. I've made the code a little safer (in
 the v4 branch) and maybe this goes away, I'm not sure.
