>Description:
it is very annoying to me how when you have a program with an error scheme will highlight the error red, but then will not perform any other highlighting when i click in the window (for example highlighting where my parens align)... until i press the spacebar or type something.

basically, i am trying to debug my error... or i am trying to check how my parens line up without typing anything but i CANT because drscheme thinks i want to see the red error more than that.... why can't i have both?
>How-To-Repeat:
1) write some bad code
2) press run
3) watch it turn red
4) try to see how your parens line up
5) you cant
6) press space
7) now you can... but it's too late

 The way it works at the moment there is an either-or choice (paren
 highlighting or error highlighting), for any given region of text.
 Perhaps at some point in the future I can make it do some alpha
 blending or something.
