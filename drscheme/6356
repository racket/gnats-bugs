>Description:
If you have more than one comment box, like say

.......................
.this is a box comment.
.......................
.................................
.this is a different box comment.
.................................

If you highlight both boxes at once and select "uncomment" 
what's in those boxes disappears.  FORTUNATELY, the undo 
function returns everything.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation, since the meaning of the "get-character" method is overloaded. Right now, if there isn't a 
character of text to be gotten, it just turns the snip at the corresponding
point into text and gets that character. I'm not sure that's the right
method to have.
