>Description:
When you click on the dog-eared page icon that you get as part of an error message, you lose keyboard focus when the error location is in a separate file and when you've got DrScheme configured for tabbed editing.

When you click on the icon, it brings up the file which contains the error location in a new tab, highlights the error location, and puts point right before the highlighting.  Typing a letter does insert a character at this point, which is what I'd expect.

When I switch back to the original tab that generated the error message (either by Ctrl-Tab or by clicking on the tab), keyboard focus is gone -- typing a letter does nothing; I have to click on either the interactions or the definitions window in order to get the keyboard to work.  I usually expect that keyboard focus will be in the interactions window at this point, and it'd be nice if DrScheme did this.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
added a call to set the focus
>Release-Note:
this was not a contract violation. things ended up in a reasonable state,
but not the preferred one
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 21 Jun 2006 22:59:38 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

thanks for the report!
