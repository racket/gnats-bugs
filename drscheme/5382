>Description:
I don't get any mismatched paren hiliting on Solaris. For example
when I add a bunch of extra parens at the end of an expression none
of them show up in red. Also, after this, expression hiliting 
does not work between correctly balanced parens.

>How-To-Repeat:
Type this in the definitions window:
(define (x 3)))))))

 Are you sure that's all that is needed to reproduce this problem from a
 fresh DrScheme? (ie, can you double check?)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I just wanted to be sure that you had started from a bad drscheme. It
 is possible to get drscheme in a bad state where that would happen (or
 something like that could happen), but it would be the actions that got
 drscheme into the bad state that would be interesting.
 
 I run drscheme over ssh from denali and it works fine for me. I'll have
 to take a look at it when I'm in town next week.
