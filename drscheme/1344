>Description:
In DrScheme, if the "Ask before changing save format"
option is checked, it will query each time
a file is saved---including autosaves.

Warning

Save this file as plain text?

             [No]  [Yes]             
             
>How-To-Repeat:
Make sure the "Ask before changing save format"
option is checked.  Start editing a file.
Either wait until it tries to autosave,
or save the file using the button on the
toolbar.  Try both options multiple times.

 Yes, that's true. Perhaps you can just let drscheme decide what format?
 :) In all seriousness, why isn't drscheme's behavior acceptable?

 I finally got around to doing something about this; now drscheme asks you
 only once, provided you say "yes, change the format". If you tell drscheme
 not to change the format, _and_ you are using the "wrong" format, drscheme
 will ask you each time you save. Note that "wrong" means you have non-text
 objects in the window and you are saving as text, or you have only text
 objects in the window and are saving in mred's fancy format.
 
 Is that what you were expecting?

 I think so, yeah.  This does leave me a little uneasy, because I can see it
 getting to the point where DrScheme starts doing so much for the user
 behind the scenes that the user loses control, but don't worry about that
 just yet.  Let me collect my thoughts and verbalize that in a coherent
 fashion.
 
 Thanks for taking a look at this, though -- removing those interruptions
 will be a major improvement, as far as I'm concerned.

It should now ask at most once. Soon to be released (if you haven't heard,
the CVS archive is now publicly accessible. Look for a mailing on
plt-scheme announcing the release)
