>Description:
Feature request: would it be possible to allow user configuration of the fonts used by the help desk?  I'd even be happy with help-desk assuming the same fonts as used by the rest of DrScheme, since I'm primarily interested in changing the monospaced font: I find that, with my display settings, Courier renders better than Courier New.

If you're curious, see http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/misc/help-desk.png and http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/definitions-window.png for the same text rendered in the two locations (and thus, on my system, in two different fonts).  The former is with (I believe) Courier New; the latter is with
Courier; I find the latter significantly easier to read.

(Low priority on this, obviously.)

 Oops -- that second URL should be

 Sorry 'bout that.
