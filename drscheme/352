>Description:
	(read-eval-print-loop) still doesn't work in DrScheme, but for
a new erason. In general, it appears that evaluating (read), getting
an exception but blocking the escape, and then evaluting (read) again
doesn't work.

>How-To-Repeat:
(let ([c (error-escape-handler)])
    (let/ec k
      (error-escape-handler k)
      (read)
      (error 'bad))
    (error-escape-handler c)
    (read))

I cannot reproduce this one anymore. What went wrong before?

Here's what I see: (boxes added manually)

 Try the expression in the interaction window instead of as a program.
 Then the bug will show up.
