>Description:
Consider the following program:

(define (foo n)
  (unless (zero? n) (foo (sub1 n))))

(define (foo2 n)
  (foo n)
  (unless (zero? n) (foo2 (sub1 n))))

(foo2 1000)


The profiler reports that foo2 takes 752 cumulative msecs, and foo takes 424.  The program actually spends all of its time in cumulative calls to foo2.  However, the % time reported is 63.9% for foo2.  This number is just (/ 752 (+ 752 424)).  However, since the program actually only took 752 msecs, the percentage is meaningless.

Probably, the percentages should be removed, unless there's some way to calculate the total time taken, in which case that should be used as the denominator.

This wasn't a contract violation (or a type error).

Reason>>> I've removed the percentages from the profiler.
