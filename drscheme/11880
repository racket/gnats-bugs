>Description:
Selecting text by dragging the mouse in DrRacket does not work (the text is not selected).  Selecting using Shift+keyboard commands and shift+click does work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new buffer and type text into it.  Try to drag from one part of the text to another; the text moved over will not be highlighted.  The text cursor will move to the start of the dragged path, however.

 It appears that this is no longer an issue in newer versions of DrRacket. 
 However, double-clicking then dragging still does not work (only the 
 double-clicked word is selected, not anything that is dragged to from 
 there).
