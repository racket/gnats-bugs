>Description:
It'd be really nice for exploratory programming, testing,
and debugging if it were possible to have print-struct
default to #t.  Ideally, this would be controlled by a 
config option in DrScheme and/or MzScheme (tho I'm more
concerned with DrScheme right now).

 Is it worth considering making print-struct default to #t?
 
 I've rarely wished for it to be #f, but often wished for it to #t. (Of
 course, I just might not have noticed, given the current default).

 I've always wished it defaulted to #t.
 I just assumed nobody else minded.
 
 But it may be difficult to make this
 change at this point, since it really
 affects information hiding at some
 very fundamental (ie, literal) level.

 How badly, though? You can always hide accessibility to a struct type 
 with inspectors, and print-struct can't violate that. And since any user 
 can always turn on print-struct anyway, anything that didn't already use 
 inspectors to hide information wasn't hiding it very well.
