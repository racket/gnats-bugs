>Description:
When doing a inner define in the macro match, the syntax
checker reports a misplaced define. But it is actual legal
when executed. I guess this is difficult to syntax check
this as macro expansion has to be done to see that the syntax
is legal.

>How-To-Repeat:
Do something like

(require-library "match.ss")

(define (f x)
  (match p (($ s a b))
     (define (g x) x)
  ))

The define g is reported as a misplaced define, but it really should not.

This is a problem with the way macros work in the current version of
drscheme. We should be able to fix this wwhen we have our new module form
in the next release.

Sorry...
