Thanks for the bug report. I have fixed it for the next release. In the
meanwhile, if you want to fix your local copy, go to the file
PLTHOME/collects/framework/text.ss In that file, around line 448, you will
find this line:

   (or (not (preferences:get 'framework:verify-change-format))
       (gui-utils:get-choice "Save this file as plain text?" "No" "Yes")))

Change it to this (just insert "not" and a pair of parens):

   (or (not (preferences:get 'framework:verify-change-format))
       (not (gui-utils:get-choice "Save this file as plain text?" "No" "Yes"))))

That should fix the problem.

 Dunno. But grepping in plt/collects, I find only one instance of "Save
 this file as":
 
  text.ss: (gui-utils:get-choice "Save this file as plain text?" "No" "Yes")
