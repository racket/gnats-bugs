I've previously requested that image-snips be allowed to have width and/or height zero, so that the operations of horizontal and vertical image concatenation have identity elements.  If and when that change ever happens, also change the "text" function so that it accepts an empty string.

 I want to second this.  This may have come up the last time we had  
 this ar^H^Hdiscussion, but in the world.ss style, drawing something  
 like a nested set of circles (exercise ??? in HtDP) is much easier  
 when there's an identity for overlay.

 I had put in 0-sized text when we realized that test suite was  
 insufficient and there was a bad interaction with other operations.  
 It'll arrive at a PLT Scheme near you real soon now.

 Zero sized images are now checked in to SVN (ellipses, circles,
 rectangles and strings).

 PS: I didn't update the docs for ellipses, circles, or rectangles,
 since they said 'number?' and I wasn't sure if that was an intentional
 simplification or not.

 No, I simply forgot to change those. I did change the text function's  
 contract because that's the only one I was working on. Sorry ...  
 shared responsibilities lead to shared omissions :-)

 Well, I'm not sure what to put. Here's the actual predicate, I believe:
 
   (lambda (x) (and (real? x) (not (negative? x))))
 
 or
 
   (and/c real? (not/c negative?))
 
 but that seems overly complex for student documentation.

 For text I put this:
 
    f : (and/c number? positive?)
 
 which is a cheat as far as complex numbers are concerned but clear  
 enough for students.

 Right. How about (and/c number? (or/c zero? positive?))

 Done.
 
 BTW, I now see why you use @deftech{} the way you do. It works well
 when one starts out on a function like rectangle. It is only strange
 when you start out at the define-struct for `color'.
