1. Open DrScheme (Module, #lang scheme for default tab)
2. File -> New tab
3. Switch to first tab
4. Select the definitions window
5. View -> Split
6. Control-D three times
7. Switch to second tab
8. DrScheme has an internal error, dies.
>Fix:
The code that switches tabs adjusts the contents of the main resizable panel (the one that holds the definitions and interactions canvases) and in this situation, there were two bits of state (the children that you get via the panel's get-children and the percentages that you get via a resizable panel's get-percentages) that were out of sync. So I added a call to reflow-container that brought them back into sync.
>Release-Note:
This was an assertion violation (and reasonably fits the "contract that blames myself" model of assertions, ie contracts with only a single party), but not a type error.

 Can you please include the contents of the internal error dialog?
 (click on the dialog and you should get a popup menu that lets you
 copy it).
 
 Thanks,
