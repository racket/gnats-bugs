 The interface doesn't work that way (but perhaps it should ..) --
 drscheme creates a new place itself to open each new file.
 
 To get what you want, look for the preference that opens files in new
 tabs instead of new windows.

 That's not quite right.  DrScheme doesn't create a new window for a
 file opened in the most-recently-created window or tab, if that window
 or tab is otherwise unused.  So you can open one new window or tab
 yourself and use it to open a new file.  But you can't do it yourself
 for two or more.  The bug here is the apparent inconsitency.  I'm not
 sure what to fix, if anything, but our response should acknowledge
 this interpretation.
 
 I removed the bug reporter from the email list because I don't think
 someone who reports a bug needs to see PLT discuss the bug internally
 before a final decision.

 I've said it before, but I'll just repeat it because I'm stubborn like
 that: I believe DrScheme should work just the way Firefox (for
 example) does.  There should be one "open tab", one "close tab", one
 "open window", and one "close window", and then all open-like menus
 and so on should always open whatever it is they are opening in the
 current tab in the current window.  It's simple and very consistent.
 It's also close to the way emacs works (substitute "open tab" with
 "split window").
 
 The disadvantage is that opening a new file in a new tab would require
 two actions ("open tab" followed by "open file") instead of the
 current single one.  But from using Firefox I don't find that to be a
 problem, and a keyboard shortcut to combine the two actions could always
 be created (I hope? :-) - something similar to the way emacs's ^x4b
 works when there is only one window).
 
 DrScheme does the right thing in all the basic cases, but it's
 difficult to understand what it does in the more complex cases.  I
 think DrScheme is trying to be too smart.

 DrScheme tries to follow standard platform conventions for editors
 (which is different than emacs and different than non editors like web
 browsers).
 
 In other words, "open" means open a new file in a new place, "new"
 means make a new window for editing.
 
 This PR makes me consider whether or not "new" followed by "open"
 should always open the file in the recently opened thing (file / tab),
 rather than just treating the first window specially, tho. (That's the
 only source of smartness, tho)

 IIUC, DrScheme has these two bits of information for each open
 "buffer":
 
 * Whether it is dirty (unsaved changes)
 * Whether it has an associated filename
 
 So how about making it reuse the current "buffer" (the current frame
 or tab) if both are false (no changes, no filename associated)?

 DrScheme currently does that for the first frame/tab (it has a few more
 tests than that, but that's about right) and I've proposed doing that
 for all of them, earlier in the thread (at least, that's what I mean to
 say -- apparently not clearly ...!)
 
 After the release, I'll try to remember to do it.

 On a related but different topic:
 
 feature request: when you start drscheme on a non-existent file, then  
 it should use this file name as the "associated file" and if the  
 programmer saves, it should create the file and write it.
 
 Thanks -- Matthias
