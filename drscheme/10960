>Description:
Hi,

This is really a small bug, but just in case it has stronger implications... (I recently heard problems with .scm files, maybe that is related)

Under Vista at least, hitting Ctrl-S for a new unsaved file opens a dialog that is different from File/Save or File/Save as.

The little bug is that the save dialog box displays, in the association list:
Racket Source (.rkt)
Racket Source (.ss)
Racket Source (.scm

There is a missing closing ")" on the last line. May be this has sides effects?

Best regards,
Laurent
