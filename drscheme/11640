>Description:
Once a bug was sent, and the confirmation is showed, the focus should move to the
"close" button.  (I think that I did that a while ago.)  But now the focus looks
like it's in some unknown element -- after I hit tab it gets to the response
part (visible with shifted movements, since the cursor is hidden there), and
another tab gets to the button.
