>Description:
copy-viewport (rather: one of its slaves) cries loudly that it needs
an object, not a struct (the vp descriptor).

I extracted then the objects (following the names in vport structs), and
then another module complained that it needs structs and not objects.

This behaviour is reproducible under Windows NT and Solaris.
(I have the impression that two years ago it worked...)

Bugs or not bugs, I still think that you are great.

>How-To-Repeat:
(open-graphics)
(define v1 (open-viewport "one" 300 400))
(define v2 (open-viewport "two" 300 400))
(define fun (copy-viewport v1 v2))

 Thank you for your bug report! Sorry for the delay in responding; we are in
 the middle of a major re-write to drscheme (the underlying implementation
 change substantially). The bug has been found and fixed and shall remain so
 until the next release.
