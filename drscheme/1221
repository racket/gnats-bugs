 It looks like no one has responded to you yet, for which 
 I apologize.
 
 After installing the patch, you need to run setup-plt with the
 --clean option.  This is explained on the Web page you mention.

 I see!  I didn't realize the setup-plt --clean was required when you
 were using Help Desk to install the patch.
 
 Thanks for clearing that up.
