>Description:
Searching for text in the definitions window doesn't highlight
the found text while the embedded search window is open.
Closing the search window shows the highlighted text.
>How-To-Repeat:
It may be an X thing with too few colors, but then I would
expect it to not work when the search box closes either.

 I just noticed the same thing, and I know what happened: I recently
 turned off the outline for inactive text selections by default (in
 response to a recent plt-scheme discussion).
 
 For now, you can add
 
    mred.outlineInactiveSelection: 1
 
 to your .mred.resources.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    I need to change the searching mechanism to search 
    for the non-flattened text. additionally, at that time, 
    I could probably use the `highlight-range' to show 
    the search results, in addition to setting the 
    insertion point. 
     
    the algorithms I was looking at all return all of the 
    search results, so that is another argument for using 
    the `highlight-range' to show all search results.
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 04 Jan 2011 21:15:13 -0500
Reason>>> the new (well, it is old now) search thing counts as closing
this one, I'd say.
