>Description:
When the definition window is devided in two, and I use either the
"(define ...)" roll-down menu in DrScheme's upper left corner or the
"jump to definition of" menu entry from the right-mouse-click menu,
the jump always occurs in the bottom window, regardless of where the
cursor currently is. I would somehow expect the jump to occur in the
window where the cursor currently is. Actually, thinking about it, one
nice feature would be to have the jump occur in the window where the
cursor is not: you could then see both the definition and the use.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    I'm sorry to say that I think that I will have to make the
    jump occur in the window with the focus (I know --
    I'm so conservative :)
