>Description:
If read-square-bracket-as-paren is set to false, then
read shoul read '] as '|]|.

It is however not possible to enter '] in the repl,
since pressing enter just inserts newlines in the input box.

 Sadly, the repl is not that sophisticated yet, but until I find the time
 to fix the problem, you should consider using alt-return rather
 than return. That doesn't try to any paren matching on the input.
