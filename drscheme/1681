>Unformatted:
>Suppose you generate an error with a non-empty backtrace.  This brings 
>up the bug icon, with which you can view a backtrace.  When you click 
>on the icon, DrScheme queries the editor source.  In the meanwhile, 
>however, the programmer may have edited the source text, so the 
>highlighted portion would be incorrect.  Usually this results in 
>highlighting that doesn't correspond to actual s-exprs.  In an extreme 
>circumstance, the edits may just cause the highlights to correspond to 
>actual s-exprs, which would be especially insidious. 
> 
>Just as the REPL does, the backtrace window should also warn the user 
>when the current source differs from that corresponding to the 
>artifact that the user is seeing.
