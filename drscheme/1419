>Description:
Since project files use "load" to load code, there may 
be order-dependencies among files.  Currently, you can 
add files, but as far as I can tell, there's no way 
to adjust the load order, short of editing the project
file.  If you forget to add a file in the correct order,
you're in trouble.

 Push the "up" and "down" buttons on the side of the list of files.

 OK, I didn't see those.  But don't you think those buttons 
 should be grouped together, rather than separated by the
 other two buttons?
