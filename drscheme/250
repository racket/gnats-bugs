>Description:
If you hit break enough times to get
the "break or exit?" dialog, and then 
your program breaks when the dialog
is up, selecting "just break" causes
the next expression entered into
the REP to be broken.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (let loop () (loop))
; click break twice fast.
;  If the dialog doesn't appear,
;  start over.
;  Wait for a break to happen in
;  the background. Hit "just break".

> (let loop () (loop))
;  => user break
; (don't click the "break" button)

Reason>>> seems to have been fixed, somewhere along the way.

 The only way to flush breaks is to enable breaks and catch the
 exception. Break requests don't stack up; a thread has either a single
 pending break or none.
 
 As for PR 250, perhaps part of the problem is that the "Just Break"
 button doesn't check the `in-evaluation?' flag before breaking?
 
 Flushing breaks makes me nervous. It might interfere with the program
 being executed (and the program might otherwise work in DrScheme if the
 user avoids the Break button). Perhaps the right solution is to check
 for breaks (and handle them in the usual way) immediately after setting
 the `in-evaluation?' flag to #f. To make this work, you might need a
 new flag instead of changing `in-evaluation?'; I don't know.
