>Description:
The countour's gray region for paren matching can get
out of sync with the defns window when using tabs.

There are other PRs (e.g., 7843, 8175) about
tab+contour problems, and it's probably all the
same bug. But don't see this particular symptom
mentioned, so, for the record...
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Show teh countour
Open a large `module' file, and put the caret before
 the first open paren. The file should be large
 so that you can see the gray in the countour window,
 and not just the blue to show the current scroll
 region.
Open another large `module' file, so that it opens in a
 new tab. The countour should be still all gray.
Move the caret to somewhere not next to a paren. The
 defns window will have no gray, but the countour
 is still all gray (assuming that the second module
 isn't longer than the first)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 06 Feb 2007 13:18:59 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN. 

The other two PRs are a bit less precise than this one, but
I think that they are different problems.  At least, judging
from the fix I did they are.
