>Description:
I'd like to request that DrScheme have some means other 
than using a scrollbar to select the font size. It can be
really really hard to select my font size, and I almost 
never succeed in having the scrollbar stop on the fontsize
I want to select. It would be a lot nicer if there were 
a way to type in the size, possibly in addition to the 
scroll bar

State-Changed-Why:
    I added two buttons: +1 and -1. Hopefully you can use the slider to get
    close and then do fine adjustments with those buttons.
    
    A text box is a pain, since it is difficult to tell when you are in an 
    intermediate state (ie typing "5" or your way to "52" or if that's the size
    you want) and guess wrong is annoying.
    
    Hope that's okay.
