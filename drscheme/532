>Description:
I "load"ed another file.
When an error ocurred based on that other file,
the reported position was off-by-one from
the actual error line, due to the fact that in
my display i had the default preference of counting lines from one.
>How-To-Repeat:
(load "file-w-error.ss")

Fixed (not released). 

DrScheme now pays attention to the preferences settings for the editor's
line/position display when it formats the error messages.
