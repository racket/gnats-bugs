>Description:
In the DrScheme documentation, the Save as Text items
in the file menu are not mentioned.  The Close item
is missing. Also, the order of the items in the documentation is 
different than it appears in the actual menu.  

There's an item mentioned as "Quit/Exit", when the
actual item is Exit.  Maybe on the Mac it's called Quit.
If so, that needs better description.


The docs mention "New Program".  The actual entry is
plain "New".
