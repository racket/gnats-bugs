>Description:
The module browser doesn't work through either
the "View" or "Scheme" menus.

Three scenarios reported below. The second error
mode below is probably because `compile-module-imports'
changed in v3.99.0.13.
>How-To-Repeat:
"View" menu with "Module":

 * Set langauge to "Module"

 * Choose "View" | "Show Module Browser"

   => error: "The module browser is only available for
              programs in the PLT languages and in the
              module language (and only for programs that
              have modules in them)."

"View" menu with "PLT MzScheme":

 * Set langauge to "Module"

 * Choose "View" | "Show Module Browser"

   => error "context (lexical binding) expected 4 values, 
             received 1 value: ((0 #<module-path-index>))

             === context ===
             drscheme/private/module-overview.ss:939:2: 
             add-module-code-connections
             ..."


"Module Browser" via the "Scheme" menu:

 * Select "Scheme" | "Module Browser" 

 * Pick a module file

   => error: "send: no such method: get-port-name for class: text%

              === context ===
              scheme/private/class-internal.ss:3495:2: obj-error
              drscheme/private/eval.ss:41:10
              drscheme/private/module-overview.ss:733:2: fill-pasteboard
              ..."
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
The first bug was not a contract violation (nor type error).

The second was a contract violation and could have been a type error.

Ditto for the third (probably).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 25 Feb 2008 13:19:13 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed and released to SVN. (The first one I had actually
fixed last week, but had forgotten to check in ... duh.)
