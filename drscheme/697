>Description:
 (read) sometimes won't Break in DrScheme. It's intermittent, but
 it never seems to break when I try (read) as the first expression
 (see below).
>How-To-Repeat:
 Log into africa.cs.rice.edu as scheme
 run:
   Executables/drscheme -x -display <your display>
 Evaluate
  (read)
 immediately. Try to Break. It won't. So give it something to read.
 Then try
  (read)
 again. This time Break works.

 I've tried several timeson the laptops and can't reproduce it. Maybe it's a 
 problem only when X latency is high or something. Sigh.
