>Description:
Speaking about dialog boxes & linux, this is a problem that can be very
annoying when I close a DrScheme window with many modified tabs (which
happens a lot at the end of class): the message-box dialog is always
centered around the mouse -- so you have to move the mouse down+left to
click the "don't save" button.  If there's a sequence of these questions,
the result is the dialog drifting in a bottom-left direction.

While a mred-level solution would be enough (something like a style that
makes it centered on the screen), a *much* better solution is to not ask
all of these questions.  What the Gimp is doing is very convenient: it
pops up a dialog saying "there are N images with unsaved changes:" and
lists them -- and at this point you can either discard all changes, or
cancel and save what you need to save.

 why not file this as a separate feature request?

 Which part?  In general, I find the current behavior annoying that I
 wouldn't mind any solution...
 
 In any case, I thought that it would be easy to change that I'll be
 able to do myself -- but I don't see a good eay to do it, yet.  The
 problem is that the frame gets a `can-exit?' message, which leads to
 calling `can-close?' on the editors -- but the editors never get a
 `can-exit?', so they cannot distinguish the two questions.  I think
 that I can get around that with a parameter though.

 That doesn't sound right. There is some place where the frame forwards
 all of these questions on to the tab and it needs to instead collect
 the information together into a single question.
 
 In other words, I'd prefer a change to the api over a parameter here,
 since the current control flow is already annoyingly complex and
 distributed and we don't need more of that.
