>Description:
see below
>How-To-Repeat:
In a DrScheme instance that you're ready to kill -9:

 1. Put
      (make-bytes 1000000 0)
    in the defn window.

 2. Click "Run"

 3. Click "Break" right away

DrScheme is not frozen at this point, I think, but it
is still dealing with the long output. Clear the definitions
window and click "Run" again, or maybe even just try to 
quit, and then DrScheme will be stuck.
