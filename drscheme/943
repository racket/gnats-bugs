>Description:
DrScheme's File|New menu item seems to work only if the language is not
changed before selecting File|New.

The error is:

 ivar/proc: expects type <object> as 1st argument, given: #<undefined>; other arguments were: language-changed
   (apply super-init args) in /home/scheme/plt/collects/drscheme/tools/debug/unit.ss

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Select File|New - ok
Close new window
Change language level
Select File|New - get error
