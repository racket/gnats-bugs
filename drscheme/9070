>Description:
The code below correctly reports
  "procedure identity expects 1 argument, given 2"
but it garbles the 2nd argument:
  "0 #<output-port:string>"


This goes away if I do any of the following:
 - pass in 'sqrt' instead of 'identity'
 - delete the 'local'
 - require the module from mzscheme instead of drscheme


It's not essential to call f from within the module; it can be called from the interaction pane or another different drscheme window.

version 371.3-svn26oct2007 [3m].
>How-To-Repeat:
(module foo (lib "plt-pretty-big-text.ss" "lang") 
  (provide f)

  (define (f someFunction)
    (someFunction 0 1)
    (local { }
      'dummy) )

    (f identity)
  )

Reason>>> looks like it's working fine now.
