>Description:
Cancelling the preferences dialog after clicking
the "White on Black" button doesn't seem to revert the
"Other" Scheme color.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start a DrScheme using the usual color settings

2. Click the "White on Black" button in the preferences
   window.

3. Click "Cancel" to close the window.

4. Re-open the preferences window and go to the
   "Colors" -> "Scheme" panel; the "Other" color is
   still white.
>Fix:
None of the colors were being reverted. So, I chnaged the way the 'framework:white-on-black?  works. Now, when you set the preference a callback is triggered that sets all of the colors (and thus forgets what they were set to before).
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation or a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 14 May 2008 19:26:22 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

(As it turns out, none of the colors were being reverted.)
