>Description:
over the last few days, i have developed a small system of modules
when i use check syntax on one or two of the modules, check 
syntax hangs. worse this particular window of drscheme hangs and 
doesn't seem to accept events anymore. Not even the red bullet. 

today i discovered that it actually accepts things like cmd-e,
beause it splits the screen and does a repaint showing the edits. 
so i'd edit the file with edit seq, cmd e, edit seq, cmd e, and then
even run the program with cmd t. 

after some edits, i was able to shut down the window and reopen
the file. 

>How-To-Repeat:
i have not been able to reduce the problem to a small system 
of modules and i don't have the time to do so now. 

if you want i can try to tar up the bundle and send you that. 
but i am not sure it makes sense. (It does repeat on a reliable
basis though.)

 Do you get an error message (perhaps in the stdout/terminal window)? 
 
 The editor is in an unclosed edit sequence. You've seen this before
 many times (and described it in different ways each time, I think :).
 The simplest thing: close the drscheme window and re-open the file.

 No. If I did, I'd report it. This has happened several times in Germany
 and I never got an error message.

 I don't recall that at all.

 I tried. The window at first didn't react to **any** events. You need a 
 cmd
 e to get it unstuck. The red button and cmd-w don't work at first.

 Is this bug still open?
 (If so, who should it move to?)

 It can be open, but without being able to reproduce it, I don't know if
 I'll be able to make progress.
