>Description:
When I try to use string->url, I get "compile: bad syntax; reference to top-level identifier is not allowed, because no #%top syntax transformer is bound in: lifted"

As you can see, I'm using the latest nightly build on Windows XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute this:
(require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
(string->url "http://www.google.com")
>Fix:
The order of the provide and the definition seemed to matter in the expansion of the provide/contract that defines string->url. Matthew and I conjecture this is a bug in mzscheme, but given that this code has already been rewritten for v4.0 in a way that this doesn't happen anymore, it seems pointless to really do much more than switch the order in the expansion for the 37x branch.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violatoin. Probalby not a type error.

 This seems to happen only at the top-level and only in drscheme (ie,
 not in mzscheme's repl):
 
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 371.3-svn20oct2007 [3m].

 compile: bad syntax; reference to top-level identifier is not allowed,
 because no #%top syntax transformer is bound in: lifted
 
 I don't suppose that the error suggests anything to you Matthew?

 I wonder whether a reference to a macro-introduced identifier appears
 in an expansion before the definition of the identifier.

 I don't see that directly, but I do see that the provide appeared
 after references to other variables and switching that order seems to
 have fixed things. Line 667 in contract.ss
 
 Any hints on how I can make a small example of this for the test
 suites?  It doesn't seem to depend on errortrace ...

 Or maybe I should try to figure out an example for you, if that looks
 like a mzscheme bug?

 I'm confused; I thought you said it had to do with the top level ---
 not in `module' --- where `provide' isn't relevant.

Reason>>> Thanks for the report. This has been fixed in SVN.
