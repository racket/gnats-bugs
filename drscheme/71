Let's put this into the database as a reminder.

After resizing drscheme, the grey-out execution history (when kept)
appears with ugly diagonal lines instead of just greyed-out.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start drscheme.
Set preferences to "Keep execution history."
Enter (+ 1 2) in definitions window.
Execute, and execute again.
Resize drscheme larger.
The old "3" has covered with hashed lines.
