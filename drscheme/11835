 #lang racket

 (define (g x)
   (cond
     [(eq? x 'x) (g x)]))

 (define (f x)
   (match 'x
     ['x (f x)]))

then purple tail-call arrows always seemed to be shown for the
call to `g', but tail-call arrows are usually missing for the
call to `f'. Commenting out `g' seems to make tail-call arrows
for `f' less likely to show up.
