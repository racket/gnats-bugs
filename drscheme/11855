 A week or so ago, I improved the time it takes to redraw the module
 browser as the mouse moves around. This will probably help with this
 some, but I'm not sure how much. If you do have a chance to try out
 the nightly build and let me know your opinion, that'd be useful.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 That is a world of improvement. It is now definitely usable, where
 before it wasn't.
 
 Thanks,
