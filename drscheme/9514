>Description:
DrScheme crashes with the following error:

build-path: expects type <path, string, 'up, 'same> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: #<path:misc.scm>


>How-To-Repeat:
Using the 'module' language, create one file; "test-a.scm":

  (module test-a scheme (provide x) (define x 0))

And another; "test-b.scm":

  (module test-b scheme (require "test-a.scm") x)

Now, click 'check syntax' in test-b. You should crash with the aforementioned error. Running the program seems to cause no issues.

Reason>>> This got fixed at some point in the past.

Sorry for the (presumably long) delay in responding.
