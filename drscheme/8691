The fix (to the followup bug (see email transcript)) was to insert another check.

this was a contract violation. It may have been a type error, or it may have been an uncaught exception (probably the latter) depending on how the iteration was written. It was an ormap that returned #f unexpectedly.

 Indeed. That was even in the release announcement. :)

 Hi Alan, we have decided to move to a world where students see text  
 inside the definitions window that reflects which libraries they are  
 using.
 
 At the same time, we will take away the teachpack menu for everyone  
 except HtDP programmers. Eventually the teachpack menu will do  
 nothing but simplify the typing effort for students (via insertions  
 into the Definitions window).
 
 v370 is the first step in this direction.

 A related issue that came up while he was trying to add his own language.
