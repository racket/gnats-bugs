unix (i386-linux) (get-display-depth) = 16
Tools: ("project-manager" "syncheck" "analysis")
Docs Installed:
("advanced" "beginning" "drscheme" "help" "icons" "intermediate" "misclib" "mred" "mzscheme" "r5rs" "teachpack" "mrspidey")

>Description:
1) comments should be also syntax highlighted in drscheme, as in 
most editors, to differentiate comments from scheme code

2) the syncheck behaviour concerning "define" is too 
restrictive in "Full Scheme".

In my case, I implement some macros which expect standard scheme
code as argument. For example, a "method" macro which generates
a method for an object system. I would write something like that :

(method (my-method a b)
  (define (inner-def c)
     (something c))
  (inner-def (something-else a b)))

The syntax checking mechanism then answers : 
"definition: invalid position for internal definition"

(what about an option in the "preferences" dialog ?)

Thanks for this wonderful environment.
Fred.

State-Changed-When: Wed Nov 28 20:20:42 2001
State-Changed-Why:
    point 1) has been fixed 
    point 2) it is hard for me
    to tell if this has been handled,
    since I don't have the entire program,
    but in v200 the syntax system has been
    overhauled, so I suspect that things
    will work reasonably well for you know.
    
    Please let me know if you have further problems.
