>Description:
Opening a new DrScheme frame while an existing definitions buffer is being expanded causes an error.

I've only observed this error in the (module ...) language level, but I can't tell whether the bug itself is in the language level or in another part of DrScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Change language to (module ...).
Enter following code into definitions window.

  (module m mzscheme
    (provide x)
    (define-syntax takes-a-long-time
      (lambda (stx)
        (sleep 4)
        #''done))
    (define x takes-a-long-time))

Click Run (or Check Syntax) and immediately open a new window before the execution or syntax checking finishes.

The following error appears in the (original) interactions window:

  module-language: the definitions window must contain a module in:

Disabling debugging and profiling in the language options produces the following error messages:

  ACK! didn't find drscheme's stackframe when filtering
  [bug icon] module-language: the definitions window must contain a module in:

 Thanks, Ryan. I've long known that there is some kind of a race
 condition in execute, but not been able to reproduce it! Lets hope this
 leads somewhere good :)
