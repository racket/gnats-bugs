>Description:
In mzlib/trace.ss, should
  (require "pretty.ss")
be
  (require (lib "pretty.ss"))

This change lets it be loaded as
a teachpack from beginner-level.

(Hmm, looks like many in mzlib just
use require with raw pathname like that.)
>How-To-Repeat:
attempt to load mzlib/trace.ss as a teachpack.
>Fix:
the fix was to set the current-load-relative-directory (and the
current-directory) to the directory containing the file when
loading the teachpack.
>Release-Note:
the violated contract is that the current-directory is the
directory containing the file being read (via read-syntax).

I'm not sure how to implement the check, however.

 This appears to be a bug with the teachpack mechanism, actually.
