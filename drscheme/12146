>Description:
This has probably been reported already, but just in case:
In GTK, the parenthesis highlighting does not work in DrRacket, even when changing the Edition settings, and this is so since the GUI change.

I'd be very happy to have that feature back, as it is quite convenient.

Best regards,
Laurent

 This happens to me of different versions of Ubuntu (Natty, Maverick, Lucid),
 though I hear that some people using Ubuntu don't have this problem.
