>Description:
Start DrScheme.
Click on the close box for the Window.
Click "cancel" - you don't really want to exit.
DrScheme doesn't exit. But it closes the window anyway.
  Use ctl-c (or whatever) to kill DrScheme.

Note that the "Quit" menu works fine.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
It was agreed that I'd look at this problem, which arose
during TeachScheme.  In his catalog of TeachScheme
problems, Matthew had said:
> Start DrScheme. Choose exit. Cancel the exit; it exits anyway.
> I'll submit a PR because I don't think this has one.
But there was a PR, and this was it.

State-Changed-Why:
File|Close doesn't make a lot of sense for the "root" DrScheme frame.
Accordingly, that menu item is disabled for the root frame only.  This
is exactly what Netscape does -- sounds like a standard to me.  The
change is to drscheme/main.ss, where the root frame is created.
