>Description:
For some characters, double-clicking an identifier selects from the current position
(mid-identifier), the right hand whitespace, and the next identifier to the right-- 
rather than doing the usual selection of the clicked identifier.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme.  In the definition window type:

x

f

(The identifier x, one or more blank lines, the identifier f).

Double click the x.  This selects the identifier x.

Now replace x with *.  Double click the *.  This selects from * to f inclusive.

This later behavior can be seen with *, +, &, @, whereas the former can be 
seen with x, -, !.

(If it helps to illustrate, you see this occur with identifiers like *******, too.)
