>Description:
Since saved reports are made without knowing which process started them, I can have
the following bad behavior:
* Start a drr process A, open a bug report window
* Start a second drr process B, open a bug report, and on seeing that I already have
  an empty one in progress, choose it
* Fill in the information in A
* Fill in the information in B
* Close both => only the B information is kept, and A's info is gone

I'd send this as a followup comment for PR 11638 -- since solving it one will make
this one much more minor.  But I'm submitting it as a separate PR in case you'd think
that it needs to be fixed regardless.

Reason>>> I don't have a lot of interest in fixing this one, unless
you see some simple thing I can do. (Of course I'll fix 11638)
