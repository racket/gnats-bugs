>Description:
Just a wish list item.  Instead of having to go to View / Split, I wish I could type C-x 2, as in Emacs.

Also, having split a window, C-x o seems to go from the middle window to the Interactions pane, and back, skipping the top window.  (When I say "window", think "buffer" in Emacs.)  I wish C-x o cycled through all three.

I guess while I'm at it, C-x 0 would get rid of the current window, and C-x 1 would make the current window the only one (besides the Interactions pane, which I suppose should remain in any case).

 Do consider implementing your own keybindings. Search for keybindings
 in the drscheme manual.
 
 You can even contribute them to planet for everyone to use!

 I wish implementing keybindings were as easy as in Emacs. An  
 undergraduate?

 IMO: it is.
 
 My model: someone makes a good set of keybindings that get some
 exposure and use, and I put them into the distribution for everyone.
 
 No one has yet, tho.
