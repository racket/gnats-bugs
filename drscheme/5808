>Description:
Drscheme pops up dialogues at arbitrary times when
unsaved files are open.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start drscheme.
Type some text in the definitions window.
Wait.  Wait some more.
See the dialogue "Save as Text?" Yes or No.
Wonder why it's saving something when you did not ask it to.
Realize autosave is on.

 This happens for you from a fresh drscheme?

 PS: if you change the autosave-timeout (or something like that) pref
 you don't have to wait so long. It is in seconds.

 Ah. That's probably the reason I couldn't reproduce the bug. Thanks.

 Nope, it doesn't. I'm not sure what to do about that. This problem
 shows up in other ways, too. Basically, the framework doesn't play well
 with mulltiple simultaneous apps open.

 The window is a bit confusing, I agree.
 
 In general, I try to avoid the paragraph of explanatory text, but I
 think that in this case it might be warranted. Something like this:
 
   "DrScheme has detected leftover autosave files. This may indicate
    that DrScheme crashed. Consider restoring the autosave files to
    recover lost work."

 This does not seem possible with the current editor primitives. I 
 need some kind of 'copy-standard format specifier that I can use 
 with save-file.
 
 Matthew, is this something that could be added, or am I missing 
 something?

 I've added a done button to the frame and a delete button for each 
 autosave file. The delete button just deletes the autosave file and 
 counts as resolving that line.
 
 As far as opening the file goes, I didn't want to deal with the 
 complexities of having the autosave window open and simultaneously 
 having the file open for editing in DrScheme, which is why it makes 
 you choose a place to save it. I've added in a prompt on the dialog 
 and maybe I'll revisit this and think harder about just opening it 
 in DrScheme.

 I'm not sure that I follow. It seems like you could get the format with
 `get-file-format', set the format with `set-file-format', save, then
 restore the old format.

 I missed that because set-file-format and get-file-format are text%
 only methods and autosaving is an editor<%> feature. So the code looks
 like this now:
 
    (when (is-a? this text%)
      (send this set-file-format ...))
 
 Sigh.
