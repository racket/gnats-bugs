>Description:
#%let gives a strange error in Beginner mode.
The error reporting seems to pick arbitray pieces of text to hilight.
It seems to prefer
 - the first line
 - the last error hilighted
 - the previous expression
but sometimes it picks other text, too.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Beginner mode type the following:
(procedure? 5)
#%let

Try evaluating other things before #%let

 This generates a "syntaxx" error (which will be renamed to
 "internal-syntax-error" in my next release). That error means that the
 output of aries is signalling a syntax error when it is fed to the mzscheme 
 evaluator.

State-Changed-Why:

fixed.

The test suite should test all of these expressions:

     > #%let
     Invalid use of keyword #%let
     > (set! #%let 1)
     Invalid use of keyword #%let
     > (define #%let 1)
     Invalid use of keyword #%let
     > (let ([#%let 1]) 1)
     Invalid use of keyword #%let
     > (define (f #%let) 1)
     Invalid use of keyword #%let

for several different keywords, not just #%let. It should at least do
#%let-expansion-time, and #%let. It should do others too, tho.

It should also test other places identifiers can occur, like classes and
units, raw lambda's etc.
