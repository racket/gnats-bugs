>Description:
Online book: "How to design programs" at:

http://www.htdp.org/2001-01-18/Book/

Error/mismatch between documentation and DrScheme teachpack "draw.ss".

Relevant book page "Figure: Drawing a traffic light":

http://www.htdp.org/2001-01-18/Book/node28.htm

Execution of following causes error:

> (draw-circle (make-posn 100 100) 40 'red)
draw-circle: expected <color> as third argument,
given: 'red

While execution of following causes NO error:

> (draw-circle (make-posn 100 100) 40 RED)
true

Thank you for your time.

-Asif Haswarey
>How-To-Repeat:
1) After starting up DrScheme, load the "draw.ss" teachpack.

2) Execute the following:

(draw-circle (make-posn 100 100) 40 'red)

3) The documentation on page (Figure: Drawing a traffic light":

http://www.htdp.org/2001-01-18/Book/node28.htm

says to use the symbol "'red", while the DrScheme helpdesk says to you
the color symbol "RED". It is either not possible or very difficult to
perform the exercises in the book (Exercise 6.22) using the color symbol
"RED".

That's correct. The book is written to the specs of the teachpacks that
will come out with 200. 

In the meantime, you can download the new versions via anonymous cvs. 
See our web page for details.
