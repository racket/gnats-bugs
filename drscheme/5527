>Description:
I have found that I can undo the syntax highlighting step by step.
After entering in this definition into my file and checking
syntax. Undo turns my class-fields black. More undoing turns my
class name and method names brown and so forth until everthing is
black.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define class%
  (class object%
    (field
     (foo 0)
     (bar 0))
    
    (define/public (method)
      (+ foo bar))
    
    (super-instantiate ())))
