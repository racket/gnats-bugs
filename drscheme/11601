>Description:
I get blank internal error message windows sometimes.

Here is a screenshot:

http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dvanhorn/tmp/racket-bug-screen.png
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is an intentionally buggy scribble program (the 
require order is wrong).

Hit Scribble HTML.

*Sometimes* the internal error message is blank until you scroll.

#lang scribble/manual
@(require scribble/eval)

@(define the-eval
   (let ([the-eval (make-base-eval)])
     (the-eval '(require lang/htdp-intermediate-lambda))
     (the-eval '(require (prefix-in r: racket)))
     
     the-eval))

@interaction[#:eval the-eval  
                    (define-struct world (height velocity))
                    (make-world 0 1)
                    
                    (r:define-struct w (h v) #:transparent)
                    (make-w 1 2)
                    ]

Reason>>> I'll move this to you for the blank screen part, unless this is an eventspace 
handler thread issue?
