>Description:
Window locations do not properly respect the number of connected displays. If DrScheme is open and I put a window on my second display, then disconnect the second display, the window correctly moves to the primary display. However, if I save a document while it's on the secondary display, close it, disconnect the display, and reopen it, it opens on the second display (which is to say, off screen so I can't access it) and there's no way to get it back. If I invoke Exposé, I can see it, but I can't actually move it onto the primary screen.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configuration: MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz. Built-in display on the right, Dell 2007FPW connected via DVI on the left.

1. Create new document.
2. move document to external display.
3. save document.
4. quit DrScheme.
5. unplug external monitor (as if you were taking your laptop somewhere, for example).
6. Open the saved document. It can't be seen because it's fully off the screen. It should get a new location if the original second monitor is no longer there.

 It looks like I need a function that actually tells me the size of the
 display if there are multiple monitors -- or perhaps easier for me, a
 function that takes a window and tells me if it is visible on the
 screen (it should probably work on unshown windows, but I'm happy to
 reflow before calling that function or for the function to do a
 reflow).
 
 I found (get-display-size), but that seems to only return the size of
 the main screen under mac os x.

 PS: it's line 3728 that needs to change once the new functionality
 appears, if you're so inclined.

 I should mention that if I leave DrScheme open and remove the second  
 display, all windows that were on it are automatically regrouped onto  
 the primary display.

 PS I'm not so inclined. I'm using DrScheme for an intro to programming  
 class at the University of Maine. I doubt I'll ever use scheme again,  
 so I don't want to put in a lot of time playing with the code.
