>Description:
I get the following cryptic error when trying to bind a setter in my structure pattern. It works fine for lists, though; I tried the example given in help-desk.

string-append: expects type <string> as 2nd argument, given: #<syntax:2:16>;
 other arguments were: "set-" "!"
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "match.ss"))
(define-struct x (n))
(match-lambda
  [($ x (set! n))
   (n 1)])
