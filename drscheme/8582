>Description:
see below
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Use the MzScheme language
Put 
 (begin
   (lambda 9 10)
   (lambda 8 7))
 in the defns window
Click Run
Two errors appear:
 lambda: not an identifier in: 9
 lambda: not an identifier in: 8

If you remove the `begin', only the first
error appears.
>Fix:
the prompts weren't set up quite right.

not a contract violation.

 I don't suppose that's a bug you just found in mzscheme, by chance?

 No, it seems to be DrScheme-specific (which is not to say that the bug
 is necessarily in DrScheme proper, of course).

 DrScheme's debugging-mode eval-handler has a special case to handle
 `begin's at the top-level. That had a prompt around the evaluation of
 a begin's subexpressions. That seems to still be necessary, but I made
 the prompt's default handler abort, like this:
 
  (call-with-continuation-prompt
   (位 () (loop (car exprs)))
   (default-continuation-prompt-tag)
   (位 args
     (abort-current-continuation
      (default-continuation-prompt-tag))))
 
 Does that look right to you? (look is the function that either
 annotates/evals or recurs thru top-level begins).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
