MS Windows 98
>Description:
Check Syntax sends syntax error messages to the Interactions window.
It does not, however, update these messages as they become irrelevant.
This is apparently confusing to users, as reported by Stephen Bloch.
Perhaps the Interactions window is the wrong place to send these
messages in the first place ...
>How-To-Repeat:
Type (define (f 3) x) in the Definitions window.
Click on Check Syntax.
An error message appears in the Interactions window.
Fix the error.
Click on Check Syntax.
The error message is still there.

 I do not see an easy fix to this problem. It will have to wait for
 102, unless we figure out something in the release meeting today.
