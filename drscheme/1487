>Description:
I tried adding a file to a project, and got:

explode-path: input was not in normal form: "~mflatt/proj/plt/collects"
  (map file:explode-path (current-library-collection-paths)) in /home/mflatt/proj/plt/collects/drscheme/tools/project-manager/main.ss
  (#%let-values (((collections) (#%let-values (((drs-collections) (all-collections)) ((proj-collections) (get-collection-paths))) (#%if proj-collections (append proj-collections drs-collections) drs-... in /home/mflatt/proj/plt/collects/drscheme/tools/project-manager/main.ss
  (#%begin (#%let-values (((collections) (#%let-values (((drs-collections) (all-collections)) ((proj-collections) (get-collection-paths))) (#%if proj-collections (append proj-collections drs-collecti... in /home/mflatt/proj/plt/collects/drscheme/tools/project-manager/main.ss

My PLTCOLLECTS setting is
  /home/mflatt/lib/mzscheme::~mflatt/proj/plt/collects:~mflatt/proj/collects

[BTW, don't forget to turn off errortrace in DrScheme before distributing. (Maybe
it should only load errortrace when a specific environment variable is set.)]

>How-To-Repeat:
Setenv PLTCOLLECTS to contain a non-normalized path
Start DrScheme
New Project
Add a File to the Project

 It seems like mzscheme also has a problem with this kind of thing (see attachment).
 
 I cannot reproduce this problem, since the only non-normalized paths I can think of don't work for mzscheme either (the example you sent with a ~ doesn't work for me, since the shell expands ~ when the environment variable is set:
 
   % setenv PLTCOLLECTS ~/plt/collects
   % echo $PLTCOLLECTS
   /home/robby/plt/collects
 
 I did find some problems when there are multiple paths in the filesystem to the collections directorys (eg, when there is a symbolic link to "plt" in the same directory as "plt") and fixed and tagged those. Perhaps that will be enough to fix the problem  for you?
 
 Also, I stuck the debugging behind a guard expression. Sorry about that.
 
 Robby

 Please remember that your shell has a quote character!
 
   % setenv PLTCOLLECTS '~/plt/collects'

 Thanks: The guard is supposed to disallow relative paths, but it seems
 to be broken. I'll fix it.
