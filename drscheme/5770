>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
DrScheme locks up, requires force quit (Opt-Cmd-Esc, corresponds to Unix kill command), when File->Install .plt does not have permissions to write in the collects directory.

Related: I could not find simple instructions to unpack a .plt file through Help Desk. File->Install... did not ask where I want to unpack it (not in /Applications/... until I know what the file contains, and should it not be possible to put it elsewhere anyhow?)

(Help Desk's Submit bug report failed. When I finally had the form filled and pressed Send, Opera tried to contact the "remote host" 127.0.0.1; this happened a couple of times today, possibly somehow connected with the lockups. Mind you, Help Desk wants me to describe problems in six rows of text. That's rather few.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Install DrScheme as administrator, try File->Install .plt as a mere user.

>Fix:
This problem: the .plt installer was waiting on a stuck thread. 
It had created a separate thread for the install, but wasn't using it
properly to ensure that DrScheme could recover.

Now, DrScheme doesn't even wait on the thread.
>Release-Note:
This is a new behavior -- there's not really a contract that would have failed, I don't think.

    This problem has been fixed in the upcoming release. DrScheme
    still doesn't let you install a .plt file, but it doesn't freeze DrScheme
    anymore.
