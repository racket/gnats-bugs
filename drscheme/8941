>Description:
Note: Check syntax is great!  [you knew that]
check syntax doesn't put arrows between 'init-field' fields and their instantiation in an object. 

It would be nice if they did a back reference to the defining instance in the class (though forward may be less desirable if the class is used to create a lot of objects).


Cheers,  
>How-To-Repeat:
enter:
(define person%
        (class object%
          (init-field name)
          (super-new)
          (define/public (say-hello)
            (printf "hello, my name is ~a~%" name))))

(define p (new person% [name "mccarthy"]))

hit 'check syntax'
mouseover 'name' field in either the class definition or object creation.
