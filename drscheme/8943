 If you first click in the window, does it start scrolling after that?

 Matthew: currently, the tour button has the focus in that window. It
 seems like the best thing is to just to focus on the editor-canvas
 when the platform is macosx. Does that sound right to you?

 This scroll wheel behavior in the about box could be considered a  
 duplicate of a bug I entered previously:

 (although, I suppose one could fix this one before fixing that one)
 
 
 I see that the "Take a Tour!" button is outlined in blue when the  
 window comes up, but it doesn't seem that any keyboard commands  
 except "tab" operate on it (return and enter don't invoke it as one  
 might expect).  Tab moves focus to the next control ("Release Notes")  
 and tab from there moves focus to the editor-canvas.  The editor- 
 canvas seems to eat tabs, so one can't move focus back to "Take A  
 Tour" from there using only the keyboard.
 
 Should a read-only editor-canvas ignore tabs in such a way that the  
 enclosing view can move focus to the next control within it?  I would  
 generally expect to be able to tab through all the controls (in a  
 circuit) if an interface supports tabbing through some of them.

 ... that's what I was going to say. The real fix is to eventually fix
 the mouse-wheel behavior for Mac OS.

 Only when you have "Full keyboard access" enable in the OS X control
 panel, right?

 A blue outline means that space bar clicks the button --- right? (I
 double-checked this under another Mac OS applications, just to make
 sure that's how it's supposed to work.)

 Yes, tab traversal should probably be turned on for that canvas.

 I've checked in the change that makes the focus set by default, for now.
