>Description:
If you try to access documentation that doesn't exist on your machine,
Help Desk prompts you to download and install it.  It also provides a
"continuation" link.  It appears that this link doesn't include the
#... at the end of the original link that the user tried to access,
because following the link takes you to the top of the documentation,
whereas going back and clicking the link again takes you into its midst.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove the MrEd documentation.
Search for "postscript".
Click on the second link ("PostScript DC").
If you have the docs installed, it takes you to point that is NOT
the top of "Drawing Toolbox Overview".  If you don't have the docs
installed, install the docs, and use the continuation link, you go
to the top of the document.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

The basic problem with this is that the url library's file: parsing is not
up to snuff. Consider this example:

  (require-library "url.ss" "net")
  (print-struct #t)
  (string->url "file:Cupertino:Robby:file.htm#a")

produces:

  #(struct:url "file" #f #f "Cupertino:Robby:file.htm#a" #f #f #f)

but the "#a" part didn't get moved into the correct field, instead it is
treated as part of the filename.

I'm not sure how to fix this, but I guess that the right way must be to
require those funny % escape sequences in the pathname if the path contains
a # character in it. That way, you can treat un-escaped # characters as
anchors separators. That is, I would expect this

  (string->url "file:Cupertino:Robby:file%xy.html")

to produce:

  #(struct:url "file" #f #f "Cupertino:Robby:file#.htm" #f #f #f)

(for the correct `xy' that corresponds to the hash character).

    Shriram says the URL problem is fixed (although the new Help Desk doesn't continue either, because it faithfully replicates the behavior of the old Help Desk :-) ).
