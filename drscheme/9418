 Oh. I'm in the middle of working on this and this PR doesn't seem very
 informative, so I'm just going to close it.
 
 In the meantime, here's an example where you will see the single one
 (after I checkin):

 The same thing will happen in the module language with this program:
 
   #lang scheme
   (lambda)

 I tried only simple run-time errors, both in the repl and in the
 definitions.

Reason>>> I just checked it now, and it's worse now at least with what
I'm trying: I use `#lang scheme', with some random error
like `(9)' in either the interactions or the definitions.
The result is the multiple-Xs icon which brings up a
backtrace window where the error appears twice, and next
to this there's the single X icon that does nothing when
clicked.

 The X icon does do something when clicked -- it highlights the source
 location of the error.
 
 I do know about the duplication of the top frame in the stack trace,
 but I haven't been able to find time to fix the bug.

 This looks like a useful feature -- but very confusing:
 
 * It's natural to click an icon for a just-raised error, but since the
   source is already highlighted, it appears to be doing nothing.
 
 * The icon itelf is confusing.
 
 Maybe it makes more sense to have the highlight feature available on a
 right-click menu on the bug icon?
