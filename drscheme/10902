>Description:
Running DrScheme with a non-admin account on Windows XP, you can close the window but not terminate the DrScheme process with file-->exit or a window close. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. open DrScheme with admin account, close, then check list of running processes and confirm there's no DrScheme process.

2. open DrScheme with non-admin account, close, then check list of running processes and confirm the DrScheme process is still running.
