>Description:
see steps
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrScheme
2. Use the Module lanuage, so that the debugger buttons
   show up
3. Change the toolbar mode to top or left/right
   (the opposite of whatever you had)
  -> the debugger buttons still have labels or don't have
     labels, depending on your initial toolbar mode
>Fix:
Update the state of the buttons after new children are added to a panel.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation. It would not have been a type error either. 

Wrong initialization of state.

 At this point, create a new tab and switch to a teaching language, so
 that those buttons go away. Stay in the teaching-language tab while you
 do the next step:
 
 > 3. Change the toolbar mode to top or left/right

 Now change back to the Module-language tab...

 Ah, thanks.
 
 I think the best fix here is to override some callback on a panel% to
 detect when new children are added and then set their state properly.
 (I noticed that just changing the language can also introduce this
 problem.)
 
 Is it safe to use change-children for that? (Is it called when new
 children are created?) If not, is there another callback I can use?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 I think you want `after-new-child'.
