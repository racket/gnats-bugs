 Perhaps the units.ss library is broken. Have you tried turning off the
 library? (If you cannot turn off the library becuase drscheme will not
 start, just remove your preferences file and restart drscheme)
 
 If the library is in fact what's wrong you need to contact the author of
 the library. If not, we need a little more description of what is
 going wrong. See if you can determine what changed (presumably you were
 able to start drscheme at one time -- what's different now?)
