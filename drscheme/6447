>Description:
The key bindings in DrScheme 205 do not match the documentation in the
keybindings popup window.

In the interaction window, M-p is supposed to mean (put-previous-sexp).
See m:p in the Keybindings popup window.

behavior of keys:
                         Alt-p                       Esc-p
Windows definitions      drop down "Special" menu    goto position

Windows interaction      drop down "Special" menu    put-previous-sexp

Linux definitions        printer dialog              goto position

Linux interaction        printer dialog              put-previous-sexp

Keybindings popup on Linux 
                         m:p                 a:p             Esc-p
definitions              goto-position       not described   goto-position

interaction              put-previous-sexp   not described   put-previous-sexp

Keybindings popup on Windows (2000 professional)

interaction              goto-position                       goto-position

I installed 205 over 203 on Linux, so there is the slight possibility
that the Keybindings popups are old, but they shouldn't be.  I am
actually not sure whether the installation on Windows is 204 or
205 (or even if it is the same version on different machines).

3.3  Keyboard Shortcuts
...

M-key = Same as C-key, except with the Meta key. Depending on your
keyboard, Meta may be called ``Left'', ``Right'' or have a diamond
symbol, but it's usually on the bottom row next to the space
bar. M-key can also be performed as a two-character sequence: first,
strike and release the Escape key, then strike key. Under Windows and
Mac OS, Meta is only available through the Escape key. 


So I know that Alt- combinations are not supposed to work on Windows
but there are a:... keybindings in the keybindings popup window, so I
tried the Alt-p, as in the table above, to see if it worked.

Requests:
(1) Please make sure that key bindings agree with the documentation in
    the keybindings popup.

(1a) Is the problem on Windows just that the interactions keyindings
    popup is the same as the definitions keybindings popup?

(2) Since Alt matches the description of the Meta key on all the Dell
    keyboards that I have seen, and since Dell keyboards are common,
    please either fix your definition of Meta, or (preferably) make
    sure that the Alt bindings (which I assume are the a:... in the
    keybindings popup) match the Meta bindings (which I assume are the
    m: bindings in the keybindings popup) unless the operating system
    preempts the key combination.

(3) I am not real happy that Esc-p has different bindings in the
    definitions buffer and in the interactions buffer: if you have
    commands that only make sense in one buffer it would be nice to
    assign them to key combinations that have no meaning in the buffer
    in which thay don't make sense.

I understand that these are look-and-feel issues rather than major
functionality, but being able to unable to trust the documentation
(such as the keybindings popup) can cause user dissatisfaction.  I am
having a few people with previous Scheme development experience say
"Edwin never misled me"  I assume that they were not using Edwin when
it is as young as DrScheme, but that gets me no leverage, I just get
back "You see, we should use a mature product".

 Hi Allyn,
 
   The keybindings popup is context sensitive (well, it is supposed to 
 be) so that accounts for some of the reasons you see what you see.
 
 I'll look into this more carefully for the next release, tho.
 
 Thanks for the report.
