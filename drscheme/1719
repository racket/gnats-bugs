 Is this a bug in mred? Heres the insertion code:
 
 	    (make-object c% "Insert Fraction..." edit-menu
 			 (lambda (menu evt)
 			   (let ([edit (get-edit-target-object)])
 			     (when (and edit
 					(is-a? edit mred:editor<%>))
 			       (let ([number (get-fraction-from-user)])
 				 (when number
 				   (send edit insert
 					 (make-object drscheme:snip:whole/part-number-snip%
 					   number)))))
 			     #t)))))])
 
 There is only a single operation from the Scheme code's point of view.

 Well, a single operation from DrScheme's code's point of view...
 
 Looks to me like the second (resizing) action is comning from
 tex:basic-mixin's after-insert in the framework.
