>Description:
When the program is running, the definitions window is locked
(which makes sense) but there is no visible indication for
that (the focus moves to it fine, the cursor is blinking as
usual), so it just looks like something's broken.  The only
thing that I see changing is the toolbar buttons graying out.

(This is specifically a problem when there's an issue with the
debugger (see next PR), since I have to explicitly break to do
something.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Module language,

  #lang scheme
  (sleep 2)

run, try to edit, keypresses lost until it finishes.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 15 Oct 2011 16:53:10 -0400
Reason>>> the definitions window is no longer locked while running
