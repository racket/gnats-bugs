 Is it reasonable to filter file-exists? when someone clicks on the
 menu before showing the menu? Or would that be a performance no no?

 The problem with that would be when a directory is mounted remotely,
 which means that each check can take a while.  So I think that a nice
 solution would be:
 
 * Read in the preference value as usual -- and never filter that.  (So
   the value is just as it is now.)  Copy the value to some `foo' box.
 
 * Periodically, run a thread that filters the preference value and
   stores the result in `foo'.  Maybe even do this once -- but still in
   a thread.
 
 * Make the menu generated from `foo', so you usually get the filtered
   values.
 
 Perhaps it's better to have a preference that determines if invalid
 entries are thrown out, so it doesn't need to repoll the files at all?
 
 Alternatively, it might not be too important.  I ran into this when I
 tried to find a file that exhibited the other problem I reported, and
 in my very long list of recent files, almost all entries were invalid.
 Maybe I'm using temporary files much more than most people?

 Would it suffice to simply filter the list on startup of DrScheme (so
 you can avoid seeing all that clutter) and have it be permanently
 filtered? (That's easy to do.)

 The reason that I suggested doing this in a thread is in case of some
 slow network mount -- it means that the startup can take a long while
 it tests several files on a mount that doesn't exist and takes a while
 to try to connect to for each such attempt.
