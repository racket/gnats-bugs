>Description:
When I execute a module in the (module ...) language,
the REPL can no longer see un-provided identifiers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following in the definitions window:

(module foo mzscheme
  
  (define f (lambda () (printf "in f~n")))
  (define g (lambda () (printf "in g~n")))
  (provide f))

Save as foo.ss; hit `execute'.  Eval (f) at the 
REPL prompt and get the expected results; eval (g) 
and get an undefined identifier error.
>Fix:
The bug was that I had stopped making my changes half way thru.
I didn't run the test suite to discover this problem :(
>Release-Note:
These was no contractual violation. From what I can tell, this is
(up to contracts) actually legal behavior. Sigh.
