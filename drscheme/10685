>Description:
Running the program below, in DrScheme, with "populate compiled/ directories" enabled, with the planet package loaded as a development link, fails with this error:

link: module mismatch, probably from old bytecode whose dependencies have changed: variable not provided (directly or indirectly and at the expected position) from module: "/Users/cce/Desktop/bug/package/internal.ss" accessed from module: "/Users/cce/Desktop/bug/package/external.ss" at source phase level: 0 in: provide/contract-contract-id-thing.2

If I run it from MzScheme, or disable "populate compiled/ directories", or install the planet package from file instead of by development link, it works fine.  It also seems to require that 'thing' (the identifier provided and required for-syntax in the planet package) must be exported via provide/contract to trigger this bug; a normal provide of either a value or macro does not trigger the bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a directory for a planet package (we will call it $PACKAGE).  Run:

planet link cce package.plt 1 0 $PACKAGE

Create the following three files:

$PACKAGE/internal.ss
--------------------
#lang scheme/base
(require scheme/contract)
(define thing void)
(provide/contract [thing any/c])
--------------------

$PACKAGE/external.ss
--------------------
#lang scheme/base
(require (for-syntax scheme/base "internal.ss"))
(define-for-syntax (stuff) thing)
--------------------

entry.ss [anywhere, not in $PACKAGE]
--------------------
#lang scheme/base
(require (planet cce/package:1/external))
--------------------

Run:

setup-plt -D -P cce package.plt 1 0

Open entry.ss in DrScheme, in the Module language, with default settings (make sure "populate compiled/ directories" is enabled).  Run the program.

 Thanks for the excellent test case!
 
 I've looked into it a little bit and found how to make it happen
 outside of DrScheme. Start with the planet setup, as below. Then,
 instead of the entry.ss file that Carl suggests, use this file:
 
 ------
 #lang scheme/load
 (require compiler/cm planet/config)
 (use-compiled-file-paths
  (cons (build-path "compiled" "drscheme" "errortrace")
        (use-compiled-file-paths)))

 ler))
 (manager-skip-file-handler
  (=CE=BB (p)
    (file-date-in-paths
     p
     (cons (CACHE-DIR) (current-library-collection-paths)))))
 (module m scheme/base
   (require (planet cce/package:1/external)))
 (require 'm)

 Robby,
 
 What's the status of this bug?  Are you still working on it, has it
 fallen by the wayside, or should it be handed off to someone else now
 that it's not DrScheme specific?  I'm still unable to use "populate
 compiled/ directories"; it would be nice to get that feature back.
 Thanks.

 I think it needs someone to investigate further. If you had time for
 that, that would be fantastic.

 It doesn't look fixed on my end, using recent git sources (updated
 last night).  What behavior are you seeing, Robby?

 Yes, you're right. I'm able to make it happen after all. I'll keep
 poking around. (It seems like my code to make it happen outside of
 DrRacket doesn't trigger the bug anymore, tho.)

 Huh.  I tried that, too, and it triggered the bug for me.  I had to
 change file-date-in-collections to file-stamp-in-collections, but
 otherwise, it was exactly the same.

 Did you delete the .zo files before trying it?
 
 I think that was the mistake I made originally -- when the .zo files
 aren't there, it creates them, but when they are there, it just uses
 them and something about the context in drracket is causing them to be
 created wrongly.
 
 ... maybe. I still haven't had time to really look carefully.

 Oops, I made two mistakes.  I didn't delete the .zo files, and I'm
 pretty sure I ran it from inside DrRacket, which somewhat defeats the
 purpose of the second test.  Anyway, it runs without error on my
 system as well when I set it up properly.

Reason>>> This is something that's not really in DrRacket's control.
I've been able to reproduce it outside of DrRacket now
properly, with a little bit more care. Here's how.

Create the files mentioned in the PR except external.rkt and
do the planet link and raco setup commands.

At this point, you should have these .zo files in the place
where you set up the planet package:

$ find . -name \*.zo -print
./compiled/external_rkt.zo
./compiled/internal_rkt.zo

Now, run this file from Racket:

#lang scheme/load
(require compiler/cm planet/config)
(require errortrace)
(use-compiled-file-paths
 (cons (build-path "compiled" "drracket" "errortrace")
       (use-compiled-file-paths)))
(current-load/use-compiled 
 (make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler))
(manager-skip-file-handler
 (&#955; (p)
   (file-stamp-in-paths
    p
    (cons (CACHE-DIR) (current-library-collection-paths)))))
(module m scheme/base
  (require (planet cce/package:1/external)))
(require 'm)

At this point, you should get this error:

link: module mismatch, probably from old bytecode whose
dependencies have changed: variable not provided (directly or in
directly and at the expected position) from module:
"C:\Users\robby\x\internal.rkt" accessed from module:
"C:\Users\robb
y\x\external.rkt" at source phase level: 0 in:
provide/contract-contract-id-thing.2


 === context ===
C:\Users\robby\x\external.rkt: [running expand-time body]
C:\Users\robby\git\plt\collects\errortrace\errortrace-lib.rkt:399:2:
errortrace-annotate
C:\Users\robby\git\plt\collects\errortrace\errortrace-lib.rkt:438:4
C:\Users\robby\entry2.rkt: [running body]

And there should also be one more .zo file:

$ find . -name \*.zo -print
./compiled/drracket/errortrace/internal_rkt.zo
./compiled/external_rkt.zo
./compiled/internal_rkt.zo
