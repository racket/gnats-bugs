>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
Joe Student writes a buggy Scheme program, "Run"s it, and gets an
error message in the interactions window.  He fixes what he thinks
is the problem, then dutifully hits "Check Syntax" before trying
"Run" again.  The exact same error message is still there!  Not
because the error is still there, but because "Check Syntax" on a
changed definitions window doesn't clear the interactions window.

I've been complaining about this for several versions now....

I'm not sure when this happened, but apparently at some
point after this PR was filed, Check Syntax hides the
interactions window (when you click on the button).

Hopefully this is an adequate solution, but if not, I will
re-open the PR.

 That helps, but doesn't completely solve the problem.
 
 Imagine this scenario:
 I type
 	(define y 0)
 	(/ 3 y)
 in Definitions, then hit "Run".  Obviously, it gives a division-by-zero error.
 I then edit Definitions to say
 	(define y 1)
 	(/ 3 y)
 and hit "Check Syntax".  The Interactions pane disappears, as Robby says, but if I "Show Interactions" from the View menu, the old division by zero error message is still there, and could confuse a student who sees that the only division in sight is by 1.
 
 Now, I had to go to some lengths to get that result, so this isn't a top-priority problem, but it's still potentially confusing.
 
 It seems to me that the only time anybody [rational] does a Check Syntax is just after changing something in the Definitions pane, so anything that was in the Interactions pane is now invalid, just as though they had clicked "Run".  What if Check Syntax were to CLEAR the interactions pane rather than just hiding it?  Does anybody see a good reason NOT to do this?

 Well, usually when the REPL is reset, there is a program that's been
 run to make a new REPL with.
 
 To address this kind of issue there is that big yellow warning across
 the bottom of the screen which seems more like what we want here,
 since this kind of interaction can happen just fine without the
 student clicking check syntax. (Ie they can edit something, forget to
 hit Run and then go to the REPL).
