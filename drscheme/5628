>Description:
When there is a paren-balancing error, drscheme highlights the problem area in pink.  Unfortunately, this prevents the grey paren-balancing highlighting from working, so it makes it difficult to find the bug in question.  Hitting return in the upper window causes the pink to go away and the grey paren highlighting to work again, but this is a workaround at best.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type the following into the upper window: "(+ 1 (* 2 3)"
2. Click "Execute"
3. Click on parens in the upper window

 Well, the problem is that one of the two must take precedence (I think
 that some kind of combined pink/grey color would be bad news). At first
 I had the paren matching take precedence, but that was very confusing
 -- people couldn't find errors at all. The cursor is always moved to
 the first position of the error, and in many cases that is an open
 paren -- you'd rather see the pink in that case, not the grey.
 
 So, do you have any other suggestions on what to do?

 It depends on what you mean by "combined pink/grey color".  If you mean
 that the colour of some text should be grey and pink at the same time
 (i.e. somewhere in between those two colours), I agree.  But I don't
 think it would be a problem to change the matched parens to grey; the
 pink region will still surround the grey, so the context should be
 clear.
 
 This bug report came about when one of the TeachScheme participants got
 really confused when she couldn't get the paren highlighting to work.
 That the fix was "click here and hit return" was unsatisfying at best.
 Other options include: when you click the pink goes away (probably not a
 good idea); display a message saying the pink will go away if you type
 in the window (definitely not a good idea).

 Well, you would see the pink, at first, until you clicked on the
 relevant parenthesis.  And since the first pink parenthesis would be the
 unbalanced one, that one wouldn't ever be grey *anyway*.  Right?

 The pink region and the grey region change with respect to each other
 quite a bit and often they are the exact same region (for most
 non-syntax errors and for a large class of syntax errors, in fact).
 
 The best I can see is to add an option to the Scheme menu, something
 like "Remove error highlighting". You could point the teacher to that
 menu. Would that work?

 I added a menu item to remove the highglighting. If you use the CVS
 version of DrScheme, let me know what you think.
