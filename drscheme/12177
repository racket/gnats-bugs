See steps to reproduce.

I don't imagine this is the intended behavior, since after I've saved
the files, they are indistinguishable and the only difference is the
history of keystrokes.
>How-To-Repeat:
Suppose I have "cs019.rkt" sitting in directory D.  I create a new
buffer (in language-from-source mode), save the file (in D/tests/),
then change the #lang line to

  #lang s-exp "../cs019.rkt"

The line is black.  Suppose instead (in a new buffer) I first edit the
#lang line to read as above; #lang and s-exp are red while the path is
green.  Then I save, again to D/tests/.  However, even after saving,
the colors don't change.  Even after executing they don't.  You have
to open the file afresh to see that line in black.

 How should DrRacket decide what color to give the line? Currently, as
 you can see, it does this by looking at edits to the buffer. DrRacket
 needs some kind of cue to tell it to try again to read the filesystem
 and see if the language line is now valid. (Also perhaps worth noting,
 it isn't just turning the line black; it is configuring it self
 (potentially) in lots of ways.)

 I expected the point of saving the file to be the point of determination.
 
 Until then it indeed has no idea where the file lives, and thus
 whether the path is valid or not -- and the red says (to me) it's
 erring on the side of caution.  Once I've saved the file I've told it
 how to resolve the path, and now it should either stay red (bad path)
 or become black (found the language, configuration loaded).
 
 Maybe I'm looking at a special case, but given how dynamic that line
 sometimes is -- red during
 
 #lang r
 #lang rac
 #lang racke
 
 -- but black at
 
 #lang racket
 
 -- it seems overly unaggressive about resolving the reference...

 I have changed drracket so that when the filename changes, it
 re-computes what the language of the editor is. (I didn't push it yet
 because I don't think that you use the git repo)

 I don't see how this part of your message is relevant here.

 I think Shriram proposed a different change. 
 
 I think he meant that when you save one of DrRacket's tabs, check
 whether this may affect the #lang line of any other tab.

 At the drracket level, all I can do is reparse the lang-line.
 
 Dropping down a level, the s-exp language (and all languages?) could
 record all of the files that affected it and then tell that to
 DrRacket, which could trigger a more informed re-parsing of the buffer
 at the drracket level.
 
 Does this seem worth the effort?

 Robby's interpretation is what I meant.  I was only asking for the
 current buffer to change, not for non-local effects.
 
 (Of course, your suggestion may also be useful; I just haven't run
 into that situation, whereas I've run into this all the time.)

 It is guaranteed to avoid the problem that SK encountered.

 I agree it'd avoid the problem but it seems like a lot of work for
 relatively little value (the user in this situation will likely know
 what they're doing), and might just introduce slowdowns and bugs.  So
 I'd vote against it.  Robby's recent push has the nice property that
 saving the file updates the language state.
