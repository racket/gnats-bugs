>Description:
when i run check syntax on the following program, i get the error "vector-ref: expects type <vector> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: 10" in both message box and command line. then i loose control of my definitions window and am forced to close drscheme.

it should just tell me (by red highlighing) that the servlet^ is not defined.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require
 (lib "unitsig.ss")
 (lib "servlet-helpers.ss" "web-server"))

(unit/sig ()
  (import servlet^)
  
  `(html
    (head
     (title "bug report"))
    (body
     (p "bug-be-gone")))

>Fix:

>Release-Note:
when I changed the custodian structure of
drscheme:eval:expand-program, check syntax's
error display code broke. It was (implicitly)
relying on the fact that shutting down the user's
custodian didn't actually kill the thread! 

The fix: move certain parts of the code back to
DrScheme's thread (this should have been done
anyway). 

One possible contract that would have been broken:
manipulting the GUI controls for a frame should only
occur on the frame's eventspace's main thread.
Probably this shouldn't be enforced by mred, since
you occasionally want to break it, but often you'd
like to impose that contract.
