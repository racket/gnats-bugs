>Description:
See below
>How-To-Repeat:
1. In the DrScheme REPL, create an XML box
2. Put a Scheme box inside
3. Evaluate the expression
4. Hit ESC-P to get a copy of the previous expression
5. Go into the Scheme box
6. Try to type a string quote => error:
     send: no such method: balance-quotes for class: text%
>Fix:
the bug: didn't override the copy-self-to method to create
an instance of a derived editor<%> class.
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation. it could have been earlier, with a better check:
the editor-snip could have had a contract ensuring that it's editor
was the right class.
