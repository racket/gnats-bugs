 I'm not remembering what primitive I want to call there to send me
 into the right place in the docs. Can you point me in the right
 direction?

 It looks like there will be no tour for the v4.0 release.
 
 Is there any reason to have a button for the release notes
 specifically? Maybe there should just be one button that opens the main
 documentation page, like `plt-help' with no arguments.

 Why do you say that?

 That sounds like the right thing for this dialog, either way. The tour
 should be linked into that page (if it does end up existing).

 How about the license information? I see that's there. How should I get to it?

 Also: is it possible to get a list of manuals these days? This is for
 sorting the order in which manuals are searched, in order to do
 language-specific searches.

  (send-url 
   (url->string 
    (path->url (build-path (find-doc-dir) "license" "index.html"))))

 A list could be generated from `scribblings' entries from "info.ss"
 files. There's not an existing library that reads them and gives you
 just a list of manuals.

 "The Documentation" seems strange as a button label. How about "Help
 Desk" or "View Documentation in Browser"?

 Help Desk it is.
