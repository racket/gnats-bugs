>Description:
I have a question about the DrScheme bug icon.  When there's a bug in the program, a red beetle pops up.  However, when I used it yesterday, the beetle icon changed to an icon of a face of a man with brown hair.  It returned to normal today.  What happened?

    On Matthias Felleisen's birthday, the bug icon becomes
    a picture of his head. It is a tribute to him, as the
    inspriation and motivating force behind the DrScheme
    programming environment.
    
    Thanks for asking!
