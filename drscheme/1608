>Description:
Giving a project a new filename via the File|Save As... menu option
does not update the filename in the titlebar.  This includes
the name given to the project when it is first saved.

Subsequent saves, however, do save the updated project under the
new name, so the system is aware of the name change on some level.

Opening the project file after it has been saved *does* display the
correct name.

Renaming files in the normal DrScheme editor window works as
expected: the titlebar is updated as necessary on a Save As...
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme; File|New Project.
Add a few files.
File|Save As....  test-project.prj
Note the unchanged titlebar.
File|Save; you should not be prompted for a filename.
File|Open Project test-project.prj
note the correct string in the titlebar.
File|Save As...  test-project-2.prj
Again, no change in title bar.
Delete one of the files from the project.
File|Save; no prompt again.
From the prompt, examine the two project files; the deleted
  file will be present in test-project and not in test-project-2.

 Thanks for the bug report. This bug has already been fixed for the 
 upcoming 103 release. You can get the latest version from the CVS 
 archive, if you are so inclined.
