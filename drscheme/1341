I am filing this because I don't think that this will be fixed in the very
near future, so head's up. 

(thank you test suite...)
>How-To-Repeat:
;; put this in the definitions window:

(let/ec k
  (error-escape-handler (lambda () (k #f))
  (car))

;; click execute
;; type the same expression into the repl.
;; now all kinds of strange junk happens.

;; note that putting the expression into the defs window twice is not enough
;; neither is just evaluating the expression twice in the interactions window.

 Warning: As I told Robby, the problem is bad. It caused two mreds to run
 quietly in the background and to dra my machine to a grinding halt.

 After several hours staring at the repl code and wondering how such a
 strange thing can happen, I realized the problem: the buffer is changing is
 the code is being evaluated and the snips are lining up just right so that
 the reader reads too much of the buffer! (In this case, part of the error).
 Then all kinds of bad things can happen. So, now I just get all of the
 snips from the buffer before starting to evaluate. I will release the fix
 tommorrow, after patching the test suites.
