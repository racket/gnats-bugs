>Description:
OK, so I want to look at a bunch of source files in separate tabs of the same DrScheme window.  I double-click one of them, then pretzel-= to get a new tab, pretzel-O to open the file... and sometimes it opens in that tab, sometimes in a separate window instead, leaving the new tab empty.

Ideally, there ought to be an "Open in New Tab", either on the File menu or as an option in the "Open File" dialog.
>How-To-Repeat:
After some experimentation, I've concluded it's a timing thing: if I wait a second or two between the pretzel-= and the pretzel-O, it opens in the new tab, but if I hit pretzel-O too soon after the pretzel-=, DrScheme starts handling the pretzel-O before realizing that there's a new empty tab to open into.

So there's an easy workaround, but it would be nice to fix it.

 Try setting the "open new files in tabs" preference.
