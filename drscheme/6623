>Description:
Save doesn't seem to work for this files containing modules with
names.

I observed this on my mac, and duplicated (and submitted it) from
the X version running on denali.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) start new DrS
2) set language to Module (important?)
3) type "(module foo)"
4) click Save

Get error: 
procedure loop: expects 2 arguments, given 1: 8

Helpful hint: a shorter program does not give this error.
>Fix:
remove cruft
>Release-Note:
this was a contract violation! :)
