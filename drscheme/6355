>Description:
I really like the test coverage language, and I'd like to instruct my
students to use it.  However, I use a teachpack with the EoPL language, and
this seems to break both check syntax and the test suite tool.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the language level to EoPL, and turn on test suite coverage.  Enable a 
teachpack.  Click Check Syntax.  Get the following error message:

The teachpack file /Users/clements/clements/teaching/com1358-su03/web/eopl-helpers.scm did not load properly.
send: target is not an object: #f for method: set-test-coverage-info

I have the same problem with Test Suites (that is, Mike MacHenry's tool).
