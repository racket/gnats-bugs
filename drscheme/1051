So far as I can tell, there is no documentation of how the MzScheme Debug
and MrEd Debug languages differ from the MzScheme and MrEd languages,
respetively.  One difference I notice is that the Check Syntax button
is eliminated in the non-debug language settings.  Any other differences?

 I'll work on the documentation.
 
 The essential difference is that the Debug languages provide source
 location information for exceptions, whereas the non-Debug languages do
 not. In the future (hopefully soon), the Debug languages will also
 provide an interactive debugger.
 
 The Debug languages also differ subtly from the non-Debug languages in
 the way that macros are elaborated. For example, certain obscure
 MzScheme primitives, such as `local-elaboration-time-value', do not
 work in the Debug languages. This difference is really a bug, but we
 can't fix it anytime soon.

 Sorry it took so long to reply!
 
 Right now, the MrEd Debug and MzScheme Debug language levels are still coming
 together. We are working on a full-featured debugger. For now, for any
 particular program, the debug and non-debug versions of each language will
 either both produce the same result, or both give an error. The trade-off is
 that the debug languages are slower and report source locations for errors
 (both syntax errors and run-time errors). The non-debug languages just give
 an error message, without a source location.
 
 More documentation will appear as the debugger develops.
 
 Hope that helps!
