>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
If you put #!mumble at the start of a DrScheme buffer, the source locations used by error reporting are consistently off (presumably by the length of the she-bang string, though I haven't verified this).
>How-To-Repeat:
Module language.  Enter the following into the definitions window and hit execute:

=========== CUT HERE ============
#!/bin/sh
(module foo mzscheme

  (car null))
=========== AND HERE ============

The highlighting is completely off, as demonstrated by <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/misc/broken-highlighting.png>.

Deleting the #! line or commenting it out produces correct highlighting.  The #| exec ... |# bit in the screenshot at the URL above is irrelevant, as the test above demonstrates.
>Fix:
The #! line was being skipped before the port
was created, but the port wasn't being set up properly,
so the source locations were off by the length of the line
beginning with #!. 
>Release-Note:
there was no contract violation here, just bad output.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 07 Oct 2005 14:01:04 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN
