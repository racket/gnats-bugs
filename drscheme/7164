Below is Matthias's original message, but the problem wasn't actually #cs
but the fact that he had an XML box in there.

;; --

I tried to use the module browser with a system of modules 
that are written in case-sensitive style (yes that's me) and 
with purpose statements as the first line of each file. 

When I try to view the module graph, I get error messages that say 
"looking for a module found something else" 

When I remove the #CS and ; parts, I get other errors concerning 
variables not found (not surprisingly). 
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation, but not directly. The program signalled an
error that the file wasn't a module when it fact it was, but the bits in the
file weren't being interpreted properly.

The contract violation that showed up made it look like a bug in the user's
program, when it was really a bug in drscheme's implementation.

 Oh, I just noticed that this is a v209 bug report. Without code that
 shows the problem, and since my own attempts to reproduce get me no
 where, I'm just going to close this PR. 
 
 Using View|Show Module Browser on tmp1.ss below seems to work just fine.
 
 Please re-open if you have a test case or something more concrete.

 What do you mean? I don't see anything in the PR. Did you submit a new
 bug report?

 I'm trying this in v299, since the bug may be fixed already, but I
 can't seem to demonstrate that problem, either.
 
 I'm using #ci, since 299 is case-sensitive by default. 
 
 Anyways, these two files (with #ci on and off both) work exactly as
 expected, giving the right errors with run.
 
 (module tmp2 mzscheme
   (provide x)
   (define X 2))
 
 (module tmp1 mzscheme
   (require "tmp2.ss")
   (printf "~s\n" (list x X)))
