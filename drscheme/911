This was discovered by a error one of our students made:

  (car (if #f #f))

makes this error msg appear:

  "car: expects argument of type <pair>; given "

This happens only in DrScheme.

I suppose that since is semi-serious given the purpose of DrScheme...

Responsible-Changed-Why:

This appears to be a problem with the value printer. (void) should come out 
as the empty string only in the repl, and everywhere else, it should be
(void) or #<void>.

 Thanks for the bug report. It appears that the error-message value
 printer has gotten confused. (void) should print as the empty string
 only in the repl (and only sometimes there), and never in error
 messages. Can you tell me which language settings you had? Was it just
 R4RS+?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
