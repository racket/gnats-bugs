 I've just tried this out (on windows 7 and under mac os x 10.7.4) and
 I'm not seeing this behavior, I'm sorry to say.
 
 You should be able to either edit your preferences file (or just
 delete it) to get DrRacket working again, tho.
 
 On Windows, the preferences file is called racket-prefs.rktd and is in
 the "Racket" directory in the user’s application-data folder as
 specified by the Windows registry; the application-data folder is
 usually "Application Data" in the user’s profile directory.
