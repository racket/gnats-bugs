>Description:
Every time you run Dr. Scheme it defaults back to the directory where Windows is installed. I wish it would remember where the last file was read in from so I did not have to navigate back there every time I restart the Dr. Scheme software.  Furthermore the (load "") statement should default to the same directory where the last file was loaded from.  I overcome this problem in my Visual Basic programs by saving this info in a registry entry and having the program read this registry entry every time it restarts.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up a Windows version of Dr. Scheme.  Select "Open" or "Save".  It also occurs when using the (load) command.

 Are the get and put dialog problems something that I (in drs or the 
 framework) should be fixing or the underlying dialog should be doing?

 It's not something that the platform-level dialog does. I doubt that
 MrEd should try to handle it, since the starting point should be
 program-specific. Probably the framework is a good place for it.

 AFAICT from the PR, this person is complaining about the way windows
 works and I was hoping that you (Paul) could test out some standard
 Windows apps and let me know how they behave. 
 
 Here's what he does:
 
   1) start up a new drscheme
   2) choose file|open
   3) navigate to some random place in the file system
   4) choose a file
   5) exit drscheme
   6) start up a new drscheme
   7) choose file|open
   ... be unhappy he has to renavigate back to that place
 
 Under MacOS X (and others) the OS remembers the directory where you
 last opened a file, so I'm hesitant to put something into the
 framework, unless it is in an architecture-dependent manner, and I'm
 not happy with that, since it makes my testing burden much worse.
 
 Paul, can you check and see if Word and/or some other standard windows
 apps behave that way? Do you know what to do about that?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

Reason>>> not entirely certain whose problem this is; it's not mine, tho :)

Reason>>> This seems to be the behavior of windows. hopefully newer versions work 
better.

 Okay, good. That was my suspicion and I was hoping you could confirm it.
 
 I've closed the PR.
