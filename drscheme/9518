 It's not visible on the left or on the right.
 
 This one has to count as a feature request, I think. I took it out
 intentionally because I didn't figure out how to draw it well.

 Two comments:
 
 1. I think adding an icon for "define" might do.
 
 2. Other IDEs have a hierarchy on the left that shows classes and  
 methods and whatnot. Kids seem to think that this kind of complexity  
 is required. Perhaps your change here suggests that we consider  
 introducing this seeming complexity.

 An unrelated comment:
 
 Every time I see the icons, I am thinking of Helga who -- as an  
 artist -- has tremendous difficulties with icons. Whenever she's  
 confronted with some app that predominantly uses icons, she sits in  
 front of her monitor and moans "give me text. I don't understand icons."
 
 I think "run" and "stop" are obvious in their functionality. I am  
 having serious doubts that the others have an obvious meaning to  
 students. Then again, see comment 2 above.

 Definitely. Icons only work if you've learned them, generally speaking.
 
 (that's why you have to explicitly disable the text in drscheme.)
 
 The big example of that I see is the save file icon -- nearly every
 app uses a floppy disk for that! since when do we use floppy disks?!
