>Description:
Check syntax doesn't correctly process modules required by the current file, if the required module is saved in DrScheme's non-text format.  Instead, it issues the following error message:

default-load-handler: expected a `module' declaration for `bar', found: something else in: /home/cobbe/tmp/modules/bar.ss

As far as I can tell (although I have not performed extensive testing) everything works fine if the required module is saved in a plain ASCII file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create files foo.ss and bar.ss with the following contents; do not save them as text.

(module foo mzscheme
  (require "bar.ss")
  
  (printf "~a~%" (+ (bar 3) 2)))

======================================

(module bar mzscheme
  (provide bar)
  
  (define (bar x)
    (if (zero? x)
        1
        (* x (bar (sub1 x))))))

With the language level set to module, check syntax in bar.ss; this should work fine.  Now check syntax in foo.ss (same language); you should receive something similar to the error above.

(I had these files saved to a directory within $PLTCOLLECTS; this may or may not be necessary.)

 For what it's worth, this problem does *not* appear in the official
 release of DrScheme 203.
