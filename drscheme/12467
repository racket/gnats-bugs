>Description:
I just downloaded and installed 5.2.0.7, started the app, and went to "File->Open Recent" to open some Racket source files.  But "File->Open Recent" didn't show me any filenames.

I quit DrRacket and re-started it; same result.

I opened several files through "File->Open", then closed their windows and tried "File->Open Recent"; same result.

I believe the same thing happened in 5.2.

 I'm not seeing this behavior.
 
 It would be helpful if you could give some more context. If you have
 the energy, this function:
 
 (define (add-to-recent filename)
 
   (define old-list (preferences:get 'framework:recently-opened-files/pos))
   (define old-ents (filter (λ (x)
 (recently-opened-files-same-enough-path? (car x) filename))
                            old-list))
   (define new-ent (if (null? old-ents)
                       (list filename 0 0)
                       (cons filename (cdr (car old-ents)))))
   (define added-in (cons new-ent
                          (remove* (list new-ent)
                                   old-list
                                   (λ (l1 l2)
 
 (recently-opened-files-same-enough-path? (car l1) (car l2))))))
   (define new-recent (size-down added-in
                                 (preferences:get 'framework:recent-max-count)))
   (preferences:set 'framework:recently-opened-files/pos new-recent))
 
 from plt/collects/framework/private/handler.rkt is the one that's
 called to add a filename to the list of preferences. Maybe sticking
 some debugging prints into it would help us understand what is going
 wrong?
 
 (Sorry to ask this of you, but code inspection is not helping me with this one.)

 I should point out that the behavior was observed on my ancient PPC  
 Mac, running OS 10.4; it is NOT observed on my Intel laptop running  
 10.6.  I rebooted the aforementioned PPC Mac, ran 5.2.0.7 again, and  
 am still seeing no "Open Recent" submenu.
 
 The bad behavior is also found in 5.2 on the aforementioned PPC Mac.   
 I'll try some older versions of DrRacket to see when it appears.

 I'll try that too.

 In that case, it's probably a duplicate of PR 12198.

 I found the same thing on 5.1.3.11, 5.1.3, 5.1.2, and 5.1.1.
 
 Interestingly, the "File->Save Other" sub-menu works fine; it's just  
 the "File->Open Recent" sub-menu that doesn't open.

 The bug that I referred to happens on menu entries that are populated
 dynamically via a callback -- and IIRC, the recent directory is doing
 just that.
