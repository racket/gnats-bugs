>Description:
The Indentation prefs don't know about SYNTAX-RULES.
Since this construct is in RnRS, and is supported by
PLT Scheme, it should be given good indentation defaults.
>How-To-Repeat:

The cursor isn't tabbed over under the word "syntax".
(Replace "rules" with "case" and the indentation 
comes out nicely.)
