    This was a bug in the contracts -- the contract was too
    strict. I actually didn't realize that the handlers were being
    used in this manner -- I thought that they always made
    a new window and returned it, but the .plt handler opens
    a dialog to show the installation process but doesn't
    return until after the dialog closes, so the handler
    just returns #f.
