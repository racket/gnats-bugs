>Description:
When you enter the program below, drracket correctly signals a syntax error concerning a module path (submod 'anoynoymous-module client server): 

#lang racket

(module server racket
  (provide x)
  (define (x) 10))

(module client racket 
  (require (submod "." server))
  (displayln x))


But it doesn't mark the margin where the error is, and it doesn't provide the
button to jump to the syntax error. 

(I discovered this problem as I opened an old racket/load file with many modules and decided to convert it to plain racket with submodules to get the benefits of check syntax.) 

This bug report could just be a feature request.

 P.S. I also don't like that the module path in the error message looks so different from the module path in the program. Can we change that?

 IIUC, this is not a check syntax issue, but an issue with how require
 reports errors.

 Sorry for pointing to CS, it's just that CS is the tool that brought this to my attention. 
 
 Do you want to reformulate it for Matthew?

 I think this is a well-understood issue, actually, so probably no need
 to reformat anything.

 functionality show/goto syntax error
Date: Thu, 7 Jun 2012 10:27:00 -0500

 I don't know. It has been around for a loooong time. But now that we
 have online check syntax it is definitely exacerbated. I can't recall
 anymore the exact issue, but it has to do with the timing of when
 errors are discovered and when source location information is
 available.
