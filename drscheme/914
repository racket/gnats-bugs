>Description:
The order of entries, and their presentation, changes in the Help menu.
This can be confusing to users.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrScheme.
Click on Help.
The entries are
  About
  ----
  DrScheme Manual
  ----
  ...
Click on File | New.
Click on Help.
The order is the same.
Click on Help | DrScheme Manual.
Click on Help.
The order is now
  About
  ----
  DrScheme*Jr* Manual
  DrScheme Manual
  ...
Now any new windows opened from the original window have the
  original order, while any windows opened from the Help menu
  have the new order.
