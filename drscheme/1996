in macos x, when running mzscheme in the repl, the left arrow key (and
presumably none of the others) work properly. This makes it difficult to
edit expressions submitted to the repl.

 >in macos x, when running mzscheme in the repl...
 
 When you write "in the repl", I assume you mean "in the shell." That 
 is, you start up mzscheme on the command line.  While I do observe 
 that the left arrow does not do what you'd like, I also see that the 
 same thing happens, for instance, when I telnet to sun.cs.rice.edu. 
 As far as I can tell, this is the penalty for adopting the unix 
 version.
