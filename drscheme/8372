>Description:
When I select a language from the language menu and click OK, 
I get the error "Please select a language".

True for both 3m & boehm, I tried mving prefs file. set 
PLTCOLLECTS to "", rebuilt from source.  Only thing I haven't
done is rm -rf the build directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrS.  Choose "Language > Choose Language ...". Click on
"Standard (R5RS)" (though any choice seems to show same behavior).
Click Okay.  Get error message box.
