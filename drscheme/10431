>Description:
I made a file and never saved it.

In the body was:

#lang scheme
(require web-server/servlet
         web-server/lang/lang-api)

and the REPL contained "#"

I get this error when I check syntax:

exception raised by error display handler: send: target is not an object: #f for method: port-name-matches?; original exception raised: module: identifier already imported from a different source
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The syntax error printing mechanism relied on the parameter drscheme:rep:current-rep, but that isn't around when check syntax is functioning. So, refactored the code, so that check syntax can get the right information to the right places.
>Release-Note:
Not sure if this would have been a type error. There was one function that returned an object or #f and the result was not checked, but passed directly to 'send'. If this had been an option type, it would have been a type error. If it had been an exception, it wouldn't have been. 

This would have been a typed scheme error, however. It was also a contract violation.
