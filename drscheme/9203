>Description:
Switching from other applications to DrScheme doesn't move the focus as expected most of the time:

1. When focus is moved to DrScheme editor window by clicking somewhere in the window, the cursor is moved to the clicked location, but most of the time user cannot commence typing (and the DrScheme title bar remains in the unfocused style. Focus needs to be properly set by clicking on the window again. (Effectively requiring the use to double click.)

2. If the user alt-tabs from another application to DrScheme, most of the time the focus is not set, and the user needs to click anywhere on the window, or use alt-tab again to focus on DrScheme window.

3. Interactions window behaviour is similar (but further constrained by the need to click on the active prompt line to be able to type). 
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme, open a file, work in another windows application, switch to DrScheme by clicking once on the DrScheme window. The caret will move to the clicked position. However, if you try to type now, most of the time this will not result in characters to be inserted at the caret. Click on the DrScheme window title bar, now you can insert characters at caret position as expected.
