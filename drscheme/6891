>Description:
Certain kinds of contract errors don't highlight the
corresponding source location in the def'ns window.
I refer specifically to errors that happen upon
executing the provide/contract form, not actual
contract violations.  (See below for details.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following into the def'ns window:

(module foo mzscheme
  
  (require (lib "contract.ss")
           (lib "list.ss" "srfi" "1"))
  
  (define f
    (lambda (x) x))
  
  (provide/contract [f (-> any? any)]))

Hit Execute.  You'll get the error message

  ->: expected contract or procedure of arity 1, got #<procedure:any>

which makes sense, given that srfi-1 defines a procedure
named any.  Fixing this collision is trivial; I'm
more concerned with DrScheme's error behavor.  The
error message is not, in itself, particularly
helpful, and DrScheme does not highlight the
corresponding location in the source.
