>Description:
If the value of pretty-print-print-line raises an exception, pretty-print diverges.  Propagating the exception to pretty-print's caller would be preferable.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter following into definitions window, module language, and hit Run.

(module foo mzscheme
  (require (lib "pretty.ss"))
  
  (pretty-print-print-line
   (lambda (line-no out-port len num-cols)
     (cond
       [(zero? line-no)       ;; for first line
        (fprintf out-port "- ")
        2]
       [(not line-no)         ;; for last line
        (fprintf out-port "~n")
        0]
       [else                  ;; all other lines
        (fprintf out-port "~n- ")
        2])))

  
  (printf "testing~n")
  (pretty-print-columns 10)
  (pretty-print '(a b c d))
  (printf "done~n"))

On the last line, pretty-print invokes the print-line value with #f for the first argument, causing zero? to raise an exception.  As a result, pretty-print diverges.  Switching the first two cond clauses makes the problem go away.
>Fix:
There were two places where drscheme uses pretty-print without making sure that the HO parmaeters were set to safe functions. interactive-value-port and in drscheme proper (language.ss). Those are fixed now.
>Release-Note:
This wasn't a contract violation, per se, but if memory limits were turned on, then the program would run out of memory, which is something close to a contract violation.

Not a type error, in any case.
