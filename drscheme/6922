If the above function is called from the interactions window, e.g.
(ask "How old are you?")
it works fine.  But if the same function call is at the top level
of the definitions window, it loses the first character of input:
41 becomes 1, ancient becomes 'ncient, etc.  If the input is only
one character long, e.g. 7, it is ignored entirely and the text
box waits for another line of input, which is then returned as the
entire answer.

This happens on both Mac OS X and Windows 2000, DrScheme version 207.

Note that (read) by itself in the definitions window seems to work
as expected; this happens only when it follows a display.

 This doesn't seem to be a problem in the latest exp-tagged code, but I 
 might not be seeing what you are. can you double check there? There are 
 nightly builds that should make it easy to install that version:

 It happens on the second read. For this program:
 
 (display "x") (read)
 (display "x") (read)
 (display "x") (read)
 
 the second & third lose the first character.

 Note: drscheme must also be in internmediate.

Reason>>> This seems to have been fixed during the rewrite of IO in the drscheme repl.

I find the function works better if you define it like this, tho:

(define (ask question)
  (begin
    (display question)
    (newline)
    (read)))

In any case, please let me know if you're still seeing problems and I can
re-open this PR.

Thanks,
Robby
