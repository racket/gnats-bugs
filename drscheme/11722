I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a change request; 
switching from "Debugging" to "Syntactic Test Suite 
Coverage" disables the uber-wonderful pink error 
highlighting in the definitions window. Are these totally
separate annotations at this point?
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this program:

#lang racket


(define (uh-oh) (error "error message"))

(uh-oh)

... with Debugging enabled, see nice arrows and 
highlighting.

... with Syntactic Test Suite Coverage enabled, see no 
arrows or highlighting.

 I believe they are separate, yes. This seems like something that is
 right up your alley to fix. :)

 (That is: if a new annotation appears that does both syntactic
 coverage and errortrace, then I'll switch drracket over to use it
 instead.)

 Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that :).  Okay, I'll take the bug, and make =
 it a change-request.
