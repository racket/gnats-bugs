 Thanks for the report.
 
 Do you have the error message handy?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 25 Jul 2009 11:27:34 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

The fix was just to not have "jump to definition" for
identifiers that come from modules that don't have
corresponding files.

 Matthew: it appears that resolved-module-path-name can return a
 symbol, in addition to returning a path, but the docs say it always
 returns a path.
 
 Is it clear to you if the docs are wrong or if the impl. is wrong?

 Sorry that I missed this before.
 
 The docs are wrong. The result can be a symbol or a path.
