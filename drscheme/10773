>Description:
I am in Windows 7 Home Professional, in case that's not clear from the
synthesized data.

I have key bindings in menus turned off.  So far, so good.  I can, for
instance, type Alt-b to go back.  But when I type Alt-c (capitalize),
I instead get the Scheme menu.  Yet Esc-c works.

Now here's the strange thing.  The _c_ of the Scheme menu is almost
always underlined (why? I turned off key bindings in menus!), but not
always.  Here's a sequence: enter the word "number" in the buffer (I'm
in #lang typed-scheme, in case that matters).  The c is underlined.
Type Alt-c anyway.  The menu descends.  Hit Esc once.  Now the menu
disappears, the c is still underlined, and the word "Scheme" is in a
selection bubble.  Now hit Esc again.  Now the underlining is gone.
But ANY subsequent Alt-keystoke (Alt-l, for instance) brings the
underlining back on.

In short:

- S_c_heme shouldn't be underlined in the first place
- there is some strange state associated with when it's underlined
- it's impossible to use Alt-c

 Do you know, by chance, if this is windows 7-specific? That is, it
 worked in XP, right?

 I have for long darkly muttered that something wasn't quite right with
 disable-menu-keys.  I think this is it.  I just fired up my XP machine
 w/ 4.2.3, and the problem is there also.

 Oh, good! I'll try looking into it on my XP virtual machine, then.
 
 Thanks,

Reason>>> I believe I have fixed this in SVN.

(we need to reopen if SK doesn't agree after trying it out
tomorrow)

 I think I've fixed the bug. You only saw the Scheme menu's underscore
 reappearing, right? The bug I fixed only affected menus whose label
 was changed after it was created and I think the Scheme menu is the
 only one like that in DrScheme.
 
 Anyways, a new build should be available tomorrow. Please let me know
 if you find more problems.

 Yep, it was only the Scheme menu -- so your fix probably solved the
 problem!  Will check.
