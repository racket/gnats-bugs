>Description:
I realized that the DrRacket contour view was what was making editing a file so sluggish for me.

I could type several characters in rapid succession, and DrRacket would lag for 3-5 seconds in the middle.

Setup is a file of about 2000 lines, in DrRacket filling a tall 1080x1920-pixel display, running under GNU/Linux with hardware-accelerated X, 2GHz dual-core, lots of main RAM, not a lot of video RAM.

Watching "htop" while this happened, DrRacket had pegged one core at 100%, which is understandable if online check syntax is running, but X could go to 70%-100% as well, even though there were no visible changes happening for a few seconds.

A wild guess is that the contour view is doing something that happens to be intensive with my X server, such as large pixmap caching or some expensive rendering.

Unless the problem is specific to me, and the problem is indeed the contour view, perhaps the contour view updating could be made more efficient, and/or be put on more of an inactivity lag?

 It already has a bit of a lag and it would be great to make it more
 efficient, but I'm not sure how.
 
 Sorry,
 Robby

 I have reported extreme sluggishness of contour in the past, including embarrassing episodes in front of class.

 I think it needs to be re-implemented using a different strategy. I
 hope to get to it sometime but at the moment I don't know for sure
 what the best "different strategy" is, which slows me down.

 (Is it simply using the same text only very small?  If so, then it
 won't be surprising for X to get extremely slow with it.  Smoothing
 would make it extremely slow, but it looks like there's no smoothing
 there.)

 No, it isn't. It does use text% objects, tho.
