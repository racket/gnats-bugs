>Description:
When I'm using with a DrScheme editing window and the "save as..." "sheet" is open, the DrScheme window cannot be dragged.  This is non-standard behavior and can make it hard to interact with the sheet if part of it ends up offscreen (if it's wide).
>How-To-Repeat:
open a new DrScheme editing window
make a small edit (press the space bar)
press the 'save' button
   the "save as..." sheet appears
try to drage the editing window by dragging its title bar
   the drag gesture is ignored.

Compare with Apple's TextEdit to see the correct behavior.
