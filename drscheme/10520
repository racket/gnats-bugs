>Description:
When I have multiple documents open in tabs, and then I hit open and choose a file, I usually want it to open in the tab I currently have open, replacing whatever I have there already. This could be seen as undesirable behavior, though I think it would be the most useful thing. A more obviously fine thing to do would be open it in a new tab. The current functionality of opening it in a new window is extremely annoying when you're already working with tabs.

 There's a preference for that. Open in tabs or similar in the general
 pane I believe.
