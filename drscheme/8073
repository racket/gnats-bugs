I wasn't using the edit-sequence interface properly. Scott's messages sorted me out, tho.
>Release-Note:
There was no contract violation here. I'm not sure if there could have been, since the interface is still kind of confusing to me.

From Matthew:
Right - I don't think it could be a contract error at the MrEd level.
To make it a contract error, I think you'd need some very high-level
specification that says certain
operations are meant to be atomically undone. In the absence of that
specification, it's possible that you intended for the undo to produce a
square bracket.

 Reading the docs for begin-edit-sequence, I'm not sure how to fix this.
 Am I looking in the right place? Any hints?
 
 Thanks,

 I use (begin-edit-sequence #f #f) for the close-paren matching to  
 determine which paren to put in, and then I insert the chosen one not  
 in a sequence.
