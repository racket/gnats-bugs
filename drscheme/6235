 This is a strange error -- that means that either a hdindex or keywords
 file somewhere in plt/collects/doc is an empty file. Can you find out
 which one? Also, do you know how that might have happened?
 
 Thanks,

 From updated docs this evening:
 
 Within doc/drscheme/
 - keywords.scm is totally empty (i.e. 0K),
 - & keywords only contains an empty list ()
 
 Hope that helps? -paul-

 No, that's not it, then. The only way I can see that you'd get that
 error is if a hdindex or keywords file were actually totally empty (ie,
 not containing an empty list).
 
 If you were to add some debugging to help/private/search.ss to print
 out the values of doc, doc-name, and doc-kind, that would be helpful.
 
 Some how your installation is corrupt in a way that mine isn't. The
 interesting fact is *how* it happened, of course...
 
 I'll look into more myself, too.

 "Teach-Yourself-Scheme-..." has a 0K hdindex
 
 (which is also the last doc printed in my debug printf prior to
 the error message, which was also recently updated, so it may
 not have had the hdindex properly generated for it somehow?)

 Is the keywords file okay too? One of them should be empty.

 Paul S. is looking into this now. Somethign has broken down in the docs
 building process somewhere. For the short term, you should be okay to
 delete the hdindex file.
