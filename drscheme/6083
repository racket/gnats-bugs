 I was about to report a similar bug (confirmed OS X only):
 
 1) start up DrScheme.
 2) type a few chars
 3) hit CMD-Q.
 4) Click "Quit Anyway" (or whatever the dialog says)
 
 The dialog goes away, but DrS doesn't quit.  Similarly, if you choose 
 "Save", DrS doesn't prompt you for a name.

 Probably should have more specifically stated that the menu item
 "AppName"/"Quit AppName" is the one which no longer works after
 the display of the Standard Output window.
 
 (it appears that the Standard Output window is using the older MAC
 menu scheme, placing Quit item in the File menu, for some reason?)

 Strangely, I don't see this. You're talking about DrScheme itself, not
 a created executable and no stdout window, right?

 Confirmed, exhibited on latest binaries.

 Well, strangely enough, this time it did happen for me. Good news!

 Workaround (for the latest exp-tagged CVS at least):  CMD-click or 
 right click on the DrScheme icon in the dock, and choose Quit there.  
 DrScheme will now exhibit the appropriate behaviors.

 That should read "Ctrl-click or right click" below.  My bad.

 right-click on a Mac ? :)
 
 [or is this problem present on other platforms as well?]

 Probably control-click. My multi-button mouse automatically does this
 translation for me.

 Some of us advanced Mac users prefer to invest in a real mouse :)

 (just to get related correspondence attached to bug discussion thread)
 
 [and correspondingly tweak File/Quit<cmd>Q -> File/Close<cmd>W menu item?]

 (and another one...)
 
 - standard-output window uses menu: File/Break<cmd>. vs. Scheme/Break<cmd>B
 
   (personally I prefer the "." short-cut vs "B" used in DrScheme, but
    in either case should likely be made consistent with each other.)
 
 - earlier standard-output window outstanding menu item tweak requests:
   - <AppName>/Quit  -> <AppName>/Quit<cmd>Q
   - File/Quit<cmd>Q -> File/Close<cmd>W
 
 Thanks again, -paul-
