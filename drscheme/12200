This may not be related to the non roman root drive name, but we had problems like this last year w/ similar machines.

 I've made some improvements to DrRacket's startup so that it can cope
 with hostile filesystems that might also let it startup in this case.
 If you have the time/energy, can you try to see if a recent nightly
 build starts up on that machine? (Even if it does, I expect that there
 are some other issues to fix that were the root cause of the actual
 error here.)

 Thanks for following up. (I've cc'd the bug reporting system for the record.)
