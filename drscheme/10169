>Description:
DrScheme should work like Safari and other OS X apps wrt new windows and spaces.

I've just spent some time with the Apple docs trying to figure out where in the API this is specified, but I can't find it anywhere, so I'm sending in this report, rather than fixing it myself.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme in Space 1.
Go to Space 2.
Command-Tab to DrScheme.
Press Command-N.
[No window appears]
Go to space 1.
[The window appears now, note, it wasn't already there]
