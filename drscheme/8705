 I don't know how it should work. I'm open to suggestions if you think
 MrEd should provide something. Should there be a way to tell MrEd to
 internally map Option to Command (in addition to disabling Option key
 combinations)?

 Is the way you'd imagined this working is for me to make two keymaps,
 one with option bound to every meta keybinding and one without, and
 then switching the keymaps out? Or is there some simpler thing I'm
 missing?
 
 Thanks,

low=level to help w/ this one.

 I just thought I'd mention that I was trying to use this feature  
 because I wanted to use the apple/command key as meta.  I planned to  
 turn this preference on, and then switch the option and command keys  
 using OS X preferences.  If I had to pick between an "option as meta"  
 feature or a "command as meta", I'd vote for the latter, since the  
 key is a bigger target and easier to reach with the thumb, and it's  
 the way Carbon Emacs and X11 work.
