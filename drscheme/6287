>Description:
The help desk default fonts for V204are so
small as to be nearly unreadable for
me.  How can I increase the font size, 
as I have done using via 'Preferences' 
elsewhere in DrScheme.  The help desk stuff was
nicely readable in V203 because I
could increase the font size in
my Mozilla browser.  Is there any
way in V204 to force help desk to
display internal information, for 
example 'Manuals' or the 'Tour'
in an external browser like
Opera or Mozilla?  If not, is there
some other way to increase the help
desk font size?  
>How-To-Repeat:
I use SuSE 8.2, and the help desk 
in DrScheme V204, on a Dell Latitude
notebook.

 Does the backdoor .mred.ini (etc) still work for setting font sizes?

 That's the windows version of the file; I'm not even sure it exists
 anymore, sadly.
 
 It is only list of things to do, to configure the help desk font size,
 but I didn't get to it before v204 went out.
 
 More later...

 Help Desk does need it's own font preference in the Preferences dialog.
 
 Meanwhile, you can set the default size for all editors in MrEd-based
 programs. To do this, edit "~/.plt-prefs.ss". After the first open
 parenthesis in the file, insert
 
  (|MrEd:defaultFontSize| 16)
 
 replacing "16" with whatever size you like. Then restart Help Desk or
 DrScheme.
 
 For more details, see chapters 12 and 13 of the MrEd manual, but
 probably this is all you need.
