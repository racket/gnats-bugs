>Description:
1. Set teachpack to draw.ss 

2. Evaluate

(define x (make-posn 10 10))

(set-posn-x! x 22)

x
>How-To-Repeat:
There is no definition of posn in draw.ss or big-draw.ss
It comes in from graphics.ss 

Is it possible that they are also added thru the language
levels directly? One of the defs has to go.

 The problem is that the posn struct in the beginner's toplevel is not 
 the same as the posn struct in the graphics library. The graphics 
 library needs to have another "entry point", say, graphicpr.ss that 
 imports a posn struct. Then, the draw libraries need to link to 
 graphicpr.ss instead of graphicr.ss
 
 Does that make sense?

 I understand the problem. I don't understand the solution
 because graphics.ss isn't my library. Does it need posn's
 at all?

 fixed, tagged.
 
 The docs are not yet updated, but if you just look at graphicspr.ss 
 in the graphics collection, it should be obvious how to use it.

 I don't understand your fix now. 
 
 Why does graphicr.ss import a new set of posn's? 
 Shouldn't it use the posn's that DrScheme provides? 
 
 And how do I link the graphicspr.ss unit to the 
 DrScheme posn's? Are they in plt:userspace^ and can 
 I just thin the PLT unit to get posn's resolved?

 So, when the new drscheme is released, your teachpacks will have to
 change. Now, the posn struct is a part of the plt:userspace^ signature,
 so you cannot import it from somewhere else. Instead, link in the
 graphics that imports the posn struct and provide the one from the
 plt:userpsace import. That same posn struct will be the one that ends up
 in the user's namespace.
 
 I cannot yet release, tho....

 We had agreed on that before. I have actually written the code that way
 ...  but it didn't work (yet).
