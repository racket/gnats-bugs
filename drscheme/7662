 I agree the split screens have some problem that causes focus to mess
 up, this doesn't always happen.
 
 It would be helpful to know what edit operation is the culprit.

 Split screen, start typing in lower screen, see upper screen move.
 
 Happened twice in a row to me, so I thought it was just an oversight on 
 your part.

 That doesn't happen for me, even when I scroll the lower screen first
 (so they don't show the same thing -- I guess you must have done that
 too?).

 No, I scroll the upper screen upwards until have the datatype def that 
 I need.

 I created a new window that had "def" on a line, followed by lines with
 just numbers on them. I scrolled to the bottom, split the screen,
 scrolled the top one to the top and started typing in the bottom one.
 Nothing scrolled in the top one.
 
 I see you're not using the latest version, but I didn't fix anything
 like that recently. Matthew?

 I know I don't. I guess I will upgrade one of my machines. I hate 
 managing more than one installation.

 Tell me about it :)
 
 I'm down to only four active PLT trees these days, which is nice. :)

 There's PR 206, but things should generally work when you edit in the
 part that's scrolled further down.
 
 (I rarely use split, but I used it over the weekend, and it worked for
 me.)
