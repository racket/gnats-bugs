>Description:
I've seen this bug intermitently for a long time, but now it seems especially
reproducible.

After updating the DrScheme code, I didn't get the expected tour dialog
when starting up. (That's not the bug, though.) So I opened it manually.
(It looks weird, but that's not the point, either.)

The problem is that after I close the tour dialog (by clicking the
"Close" button) DrScheme doesn't exit properly. When I subsequently close
the main window, I don't get a "really exit?" dialog, and the Unix process
doesn't terminate.

This was happening to me with earlier versions, where the tour dialog popped
up at startup, but it wasn't reliable.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Select "Welcome to DrScheme" from the Help menu
Click "Close" in the window that appears
Close the original DrScheme window by clicking the close box

 I forgot to update the version number in the new release. I was under some time pressure this time... Sorry about that. I will do it tommorrow, I expect.
 
 
 (This does not address the main problem of this pr, of course)

 Does this still happen with the currently checked in version of 
 drscheme? I cannot repdroduce the problem (although I have seen it 
 intermittently myself).

 Yes, on my RH 5.2 setup.
 
 It seems to only happen when I click the close box on DrScheme's main
 window, not when I select the "Quit" menu.

 Seems unlikely that this is an aritecture specific problem. Can you 
 move your preferences out of the way and see if it still happens with 
 the default preferences? If so, send me your preferences.

 Yeah, I tried that.
 
 Thanks,

 It could be some sort of race condition, though, Unix vs Mac/Windows,
 etc.

 Yes, it happens with the default preferences.

 It's extremely reliable for me, including from /home/scheme on
 sun.cs.rice.edu.
 
 Just to be clear: I click "Close" on the welcome window (it goes away),
 then I click the WM-based close box on the main DrScheme window (it
 goes away, too, with no "really exit?" dialog).

 Aha! I didn't realize that you meant the close button! I was clicking 
 the close box. That was the problem. It is fixed (not released) now.
 
 Thanks,
