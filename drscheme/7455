>Description:
Adding a non-teachpack file as a teachpack has two problems.

1) The error given is that there is no module definition in the file. Students are scared by this.

2) The error is not given until the code is "Run...", rather than when the add is attempted. So, if they add the teachpack at the beginning of the lecture, then they are doubly scared by this strange error.
