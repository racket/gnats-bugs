>Description:
Clicking the "Cancel" button in DrScheme's
Preferences seems to reset all the custom colors
as if "Revert to Default" had been clicked.
>How-To-Repeat:
- type a symbol like 'abc in the definitions window
- open the Edit / Preferences / Colors / Scheme tab
- change the color for symbols
The color of 'abc in the definitions window is
then changed.
- open Edit / Preferences again (any tab will do)
- click "Cancel"
The custom color you just created disappears,
both in the definitions window and in the
Color / Scheme tab
>Fix:
The bug was in the way that the color prefs dealt were using the preferences library. Specifically, it was (accidentally) exploiting sharing to save old values of the preferences when computing new ones. It no longer has any sharing.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor was it a type error.

 Did you click "ok" in between or just hide the window?

 Yes.  I can even quit drscheme in between and the result is the same.
 On the other hand it looks like my mzscheme program has some serious
 problems (see my email to plt-internal) so this color bug might just
 be a weird drscheme-specific consequence of my other problem.  Stay
 tuned...
