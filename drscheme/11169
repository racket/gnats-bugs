>Description:
Hi,

When there are too many tabs in DrRacket (Ubuntu),
the rightmost ones are not visible.
They can be reached with Ctrl-Tab, but this is a blind search.
Having left-right buttons to push tab labels on either side would be nice.

Tell me if you need a screenshot if you don't see what I mean.

Thanks,
Laurent
