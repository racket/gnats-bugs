 Let me be more explicit: I just junked "plt:collects:doc:framework", 
 and re-downloaded it.  I then restarted DrScheme, searched for 
 "preferences", and chose the link (in the Framework section) labelled:
 
 preferences in "Preferences"
 
 Here's (most of) the text from that page:
 
 Preferences
 
 The framework provides a user preferences manager. It provides 
 facilities for getting, setting, marshalling and unmarshalling the 
 user's preferences as well as utilities to manage a preferences 
 dialog box.
 
 In addition to the functions @flink preferences:add-general-panel , 
 and @flink preferences:add-font-panel listed here, @flink 
 scheme:add-preferences-panel also adds panels to the preferences 
 dialog.
 
 ...
 
 Notice that @flink appears several times.
