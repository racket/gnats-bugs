>Description:
Instead of positioning a red mark at the point of the 
error, could you please first force any highlighted text
to be unhighlighted and then actually position the cursor
at the point of the error?  Possibly because of my use of
several IDE/editors over the years, I have several times 
lost some lines of text because I had them highlighted,
executed the code, the Scheme IDE put a red mark (but not
the cursor) at the point of the error and when I started
typing I would lose what I had - I know I can use the undo
capability, but I think the way you have it programmed will
cause no end of frustration to kids and also not be in
concert with our experience of other IDEs  Thanks for
your consideration on this.

Joe
