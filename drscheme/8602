The fix was to change a void return into a #f return in
a helper function. (This was a missed change from an earlier
fix.)

Reason>>> Fixed and released to SVN, I believe.

When I opened that file, I got a runtime error in 
drscheme, not cycle consumption. Still, it was likely
the same error.

 Yes, if you open drscheme on this file, you get a runtime error only.  
 If you open drscheme on a *different* file and then open this one, it  
 goes to the top of the CPU consumption list and stays there.

 Oh! Thanks for clarifying. I see that happening now (when I
 reintroduce the bug).
 
 I'll investigate a little bit (enough to break drscheme during the
 loop with errortrace .zos on).

 Hm. Well, that didn't help. I got an empty stacktrace. Breaking does
 cause the infinite loop to terminate, tho. Something fishy is going
 on, but I'm not sure what.
 
 I also tried putting an error into the after-load-file of just a
 regular text% object and that didn't go into an infinite loop.
 
 So, I'm stymied. Since the looping problem is gone with the original
 bugfix, I think I'll just hold off on looking more, unless one of you
 has an idea?
 
 Robby
