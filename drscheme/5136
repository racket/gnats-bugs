>Description:
the gray highlighting of parens has a funny delayed behavior in
DrScheme.  See steps to reproduce. I have verified that this bug
occurs under UNIX, as well as on my mac.
>How-To-Repeat:
evaluate (printf "()      ()~n")

Now, click to put the insert caret somewhere between the two
parens.  Now hit the right arrow until the caret is just before
the rightmost left paren. No highlighting.  Now hit the left arrow.
Aha!  There's the highlighting.  In general, the highlight 
seems to appear one keystroke after it's supposed to.
