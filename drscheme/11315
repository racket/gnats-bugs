>Description:
DrRacket should offer a menu item from the Racket submenu that allows you to break a long line (e.g., greater than 80 chars, though this could/should be configurable) by inserting a carriage return in a place that makes sense. I would argue for putting it as close to the left after a block of text as possible. Inserting it before the first open-parenthesis would also make sense.

This is badly needed for all students who are spending sizable amounts of time (amounting literally to hours) to break long lines to meet format requirements for assignments.

This could apply to the line at the cursor or to all lines at once (along the lines of the reindent function). Both would be useful, but either one would be far better than none at all.

Reason>>> 

While I agree that this would be a great feature to have, I
don't think that I will be attempting it any time soon so I
am going to close this PR.

You may consider raising the issue on the mailing lists and
see if you get a taker or get some help on making the
attempt yourself.

Best,
Robby
