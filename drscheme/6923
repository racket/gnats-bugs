>Description:
Please count one vote for changing the default DrScheme comment
color back to cyan/turquoise/light-blue.

The default font with this shade of yellow is difficult to read,
and (subjectively) not very pleasant-looking.

Also, the light-blue color used for variables now in Check Syntax
is hard to read for code, but a color that light would be more OK
for comment text, IMHO.
