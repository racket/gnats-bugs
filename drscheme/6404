 Oh, "the editor" means DrScheme's REPL? That's not currently supported
 and, in fact, is a big "security hole" in DrScheme; that should not be
 allowed.
 
 If you mean some other editor that is created as part of the user's
 program then you've probably just got a bug in your program. If you
 send a small example that appears to be doing the wrong thing, I can
 probably point out the problem.

 I don't know what other editors Greg has in mind, but we definitely
 want this in the REPL.  Why is this a "big *security hole*" that
 should be prevented at all costs?  I don't see it ...

 User-land code is running on the drscheme thread and therefore has
 access to DrScheme's custodian.
 
 Here's a simple test: in the draw callback of your snip (say, the 100th
 time it is called), put this:
 
   (custodian-shutdown-all (current-custodian))
 
 and see if DrScheme exits. I'd assume you consider this problem (if it
 actually does exit).

 Somehow the cc to bugs@plt-scheme.org got dropped; I've added it back.
 
 (below is from an earlier message that wasn't cc'd to bugs).
 
 You mean you're using a bitmap-snip% instance? You realize, of course, 
 that drscheme (at the moment) allows any snip to appear, including one 
 from a class that you wrote. Bitmaps only makes the problem simpler, 
 but not entirely obvious, due to multi-threading issues.

 [Aside to Robby: I'm not sure what your follow-up about "any snip to
 appear" really means.  But maybe we should approach this from a higher
 level rather than pursuing our bottom-up thread to date.]
 
 Our question is really a DrX issue, so I'll try to explain it in those
 terms below.
 
 We're trying to instantiate DrX | X = FrTime (aka FRP in DrScheme).
 Eg: one of the signals in FrTime is NOW, which has a value at every
 point in time, and indeed always gives you the current time.
 Currently, you get the following interaction:
 
   > now
   #<struct ...>
 
 Of course we could print-convert this to look better, but the point is
 that by the time I even look at the value printed, the value has
 already changed.  This is not a very good way of understanding the
 behavior of a program.
 
 As a way around this, we thought we could evaluate to snips:
 
   > now
   [an image]
 
 sort of like draw2.ss, except that the value displayed in the snip
 would get updated continuously.
 
 Continuous update is the correct notion of "transparency" for FrTime.
 Values go stale not only because the program source changes, but also
 because of events that occur and signals that update.  Now this is
 also true in Scheme:
 
   > (read-line (open-input-file "speech"))
   "To bait fish withal"
 
 might, later, evaluate to
 
   "The quality of mercy is not strained"
 
 but that happens less often and in well-defined places.  In contrast,
 *all* values in FrTime have this continuously-varying property.
 
 Currently, when you perform some actions that perturb DrScheme, such
 as scrolling, etc, the snip gets redrawn, resulting in a fresh value
 printed within it.  But we would like this to happen on a frequency
 determined by the signal, not by the act of viewing.  (Think of this
 as draw2.ss, except with the snips containing animations, not static
 pictures.  This is just what it means to be a *value* in FrTime.)
 
 But, our question is not really about snips and redraw behavior; it's
 how to accomplish this in DrScheme so that it meets the DrX criterion
 of being turned into a programming environment for FrTime.
 
 Not that you've proposed this, but I might as well head this off at
 the pass: Telling us to provide an external graphing interface to
 "see" the changing value of a signal isn't any more meaningful than
 saying the REPL doesn't print any values -- if you actually want to
 see the output you have to write a print statement.  It also doesn't
 make much sense for non-numeric values, structs, etc.
 
 Thanks,
 Shriram

 It means that the user can create a subclass of the class snip% (and
 override its methods, including the draw method, etc). The user can the
 cause such a snip to be the result of an interaction in the REPL. When
 that happens, drscheme (foolishly) trusts this snip and, in order to
 display it, invokes it's methods under the auspicies of the drscheme
 custodian (in the drscheme thread, with the drscheme namespace, etc
 etc). Is that clear?
 
 Here's an example piece of code that kills drscheme (something that
 should not be possible) when submitted to the REPL in the mred
 language:
 
 (letrec ([s% (class snip%
 	       (define/override (copy) (new s%))
                (define/override (draw . x)
                  (custodian-shutdown-all (current-custodian)))
                (super-new))])
   (new s%))
 
 Accordingly, DrScheme would have to support some way for the user's
 program to trigger redraws of already existing portions of its buffer,
 but without allowing it to kill things.
 
 This means that some syncronization is required. Where this gets really
 tricky is somehow ensuring that DrScheme cannot deadlock, even if the
 other party (the user's program that sends these ticks) suddenly
 disappears, even possibly during a critical region (say if the program
 commits suicide, or if somone chooses "kill" from the scheme menu).
 
 The IO portion of DrScheme's REPL is the most subtle portion of
 DrScheme's entire code base (at least the parts I maintain). This would
 be a generalization of it.
 
 Matthew and I have worked out a way to do this (our kill safety paper)
 and plan to submit something to an upcoming conference, but the REPL
 hasn't be rewritten with the new primitives yet.

 Perhaps. But you need to understand this point if you want to continue
 with this idea. Otherwise just put your snips in a separate window.

 Thanks for your very clear explanation.
 
 I don't know about your new "kill safety" primitives.  The high-order
 question is, when the new REPL is in place, will we be able to
 implement what we want (or something very close to it)?  What
 restrictions might we face?

 It's the CML stuff that Matthew sent messages out about before. There's
 more than just in CML, but it's all in the mzscheme manual. There
 should be a paper someday.

 Well, if I just answer that question, I would just say something like
 "yes, because you mentioned this before I started", but the interesting
 question is when the new REPL comes into place... 
 
 I guess 300 is a good point to try out a new repl implementation.
 Perhaps we'll even get some speed out of it. Lets see.
 
 FWIW, since I'm starting over it would be easy for me to provide a
 specialized interface where I get a stream of bitmaps from you, similar
 to the way the IO ports are streams of characters. 
 
 To help me start thinking about this: do you do imperative updates of
 your bitmaps, or is constructing a new one every time efficient enough?
 Not having started, I think that new bitmaps each time would be easier
 for me.

 This is good to know -- it may take a while but it'll come out right.
 
 At this point Greg and I have only thought in terms of updating snips
 because that seemed like the simplest starting point (and we thought
 it'd just work off the bat).  Since you're in the design phase, we
 should work out in more detail what would work best for us.
 
 The bitmaps, whether updated or generated afresh, are only appropriate
 for one kind of value, namely the reactive version of draw2 (imagine
 that you had rotating faces, bouncing balls, whatever -- these are
 already very easy to do in a draw.ss kind of window, and we were
 looking to extend it for other applications we have in mind).  It's
 not clear what makes most sense for numbers, structures, ... all the
 other boring types.
 
 We'll kibitz and get back to you.
 
 Greg, let's talk about this tomorrow.

 If it helps, I doubt I'll be able to support any kind of interface
 where the value itself has code attached to specify how to draw itself.
 A stream of (immutable, once passed on) bitmaps seems doable, and
 mutable bitmaps might be possible, but I'm not sure exactly how it
 would work.

 I think image-snip% disallows updating in place, but it doesn't make much
 difference.  I can maintain two bitmaps and keep swapping them.
 
 Actually, it would be more helpful to have a mutable version of
 string-snip% (or whatever the REPL uses when displaying values), since
 we'll want to display most types of values as strings.

 Fair enough.  It would not be reasonable to expect you to support that
 -- it seems like a very language-sensitive thing to determine how that
 attached code is supposed to run (ie, Scheme code might have to run in
 a totally different way than FrTime code).  A stream seems like a much
 better interface.

 I've read the follow-up discussion, but I didn't see one thing that I
 expected:
 
 Does your snip call the `needs-update' method of its administrator when
 the content changes? If not, that may be all you need to continue with
 your prototype.
 
 If you're already calling `needs-update', then it sounds like there's a
 real bug.

 It's possible he's using an image-snip% (I think I asked about this,
 but there wasn't a response yet?) and just setting the bitmap in it.
 Probably the image-snip should be calling that.

 Yes, I'm using an image-snip% and just setting the bitmap in it.  I did
 think of calling needs-update on the administrator, but get-admin always
 returned #f.

 You need a subclass to do it right; the snip is `copy'd before inserted
 into the buffer; you'll need to override the copy method and call
 needs-update on the copy (probably by overriding set-bitmap or
 whatever). Actually, now that I think about it, you've still not given
 me enough information to understand what is going on -- perhaps you can
 make a small example that fits in the definitions window and then I'll
 be able to help.
