 #lang scheme

The variable edition-pair could have been #f, but this wasn't checked for.
>Release-Note:

This definitely could have been a typed scheme type error. It was a contract error.

 Only in when debugging is disabled, though.

 Bugs like these make me want to just port entire files to typed scheme....

 What exactly triggered this comment? (It is a great testimonial to  
 Sam's dissertation.)

 The bug in the PR.  It was a completly stupid mistake that a type
 system could easily have caught, but would have been hard to catch
 with a unit test because the code is all tied up inside drscheme (you
 essentially have to have an entire drscheme running to test that
 function so, as you might guess, it wasn't tested...).
