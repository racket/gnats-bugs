>Description:
The font colors in DrRacket's definitions window change so that they're barely readable after clicking "Run" in DrRacket 5.0.99.

Before clicking "Run":
http://98.129.169.48/tmp/110203111338.png

After clicking "Run":
http://98.129.169.48/tmp/110203110541.png

Clicking "Clear Error Highlight" in the Racket menu or typing in the definitions window resets the colors.  It looks like this is some kind of special error highlighting, but I was unable to find an option to turn this off or a way to change the background coloring.

I've reproduced this with DrRacket 5.0.1, 5.0.2, and 5.0.99.  It happens with the default color scheme as well.

 It is the black part that you're talking about, not the orange part, right?

 I was referring to the font colors in general after clicking "Run".  Are
 they supposed to change?  If so, there should be an option to either
 turn it off or customize how they change.  With my color scheme, it
 makes the text unreadable.  With the default color scheme, it makes the
 text difficult to read.
 
 Thanks,
 Jason

 Yes, they are supposed to change. The teaching languages report when
 the tests do not cover all of the code by changing the colors of the
 text.
 
 Meanwhile, do you see this only after you've just changed the colors,
 or is it permanently like that? That is, if you run the program again
 after changing the colors, do you see something more reasonable? If
 not, how about after you restart DrRacket?
 
 Also, did you try clicking the 'white-on-black' button in the
 preferences dialog, or were you adjusting the colors one by one?

 Well, I didn't hear back from you about this, but I think I know the
 answers, so I fixed what I could and I've closed the PR. If you try
 out the nightly build from some day in the future, you can see, if you
 wish.
 
 Thanks for the report.
