>Description:
The contract for drscheme:debug:open-and-highlight-in-file is given (in drscheme/private/tool-contracts.ss) as (cons/c ... (cons/c number? number?)), but the implementation (in drscheme/private/debug.ss) is using srcloc structures.
>How-To-Repeat:
(This prevents the SchemeUnit GUI from highlighting assertion locations.)
>Fix:
fixed the contract
>Release-Note:
This was, I presume, a contract violation, but a case where the spec was wrong.
