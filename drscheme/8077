>Description:
The built-in functions triangle, circle, rectangle, ellipse, etc.
all recognize a certain collection of strings (and symbols) as
color names.  But if you type a color name that they don't recognize,
like "mauve", you get a type error, even though (from the student's
perspective) the type of the argument was string, just as it's
supposed to be.

Could this error message be modified to something like
"I don't recognize the string "mauve" as a color"
instead of
"expected <image-color> as third argument, given: "mauve""?

 This is slightly interesting from a contract perspective. If you
 
   (provide/contract
     [show-color ( (and/c string? color-string?) . -> . any)])
 
 the error message from a Scheme perspective is that "mauve" just 
 doesn't satisfy the contract. If you reformulate this in ML as
 
   sig
    val isColorString : String -> boolean
    val showColor : String [isColorString] -> Unit
    ...
 
 you'd probably say "it's type correct but not a color string".

 This gets away from our "expected X, given Y" format for all the other
 error messages, but I don't see a good way to stay in the format.
 
 Any suggestions?

 Sure, but we've known that for a long time. You can also encode this
 all into a tst datatype in the ml world and get the scheme-like
 contract too.

 Okay. I'll step out of the mold for strings/symbols that aren't colors.

 I think we should produce
 
   expected <color-string> as third argument, given "mauve"
 
 for now. I.e., make the contract word a "subword" of the "type like" 
 concept. -- Matthias

 That doesn't seem like it would satisfy. 
 
 Plus, they don't have to be strings. They can be symbols or color
 objects. That's why I picked the term image-color.

 Ah, yes, I hacked draw.ss in the same way. Let me look there ...
 
 I first check for symbol-ness (and I thought I had done strings, too, 
 but for some reason that code isn't there) and if it isn't one of those 
 I say
 
   "expected <symbol> as third argument, given 5"
 
 Otherwise I say
 
   "mauve is not a legal color in draw.ss"

 Yeah, that's what he wants, but we lose the consistent error message
 format.
 
 Oh well.
