>Description:
I have a tiny and reproducible bug!  You want to fix it!
Even though it only occurs with c-x;c-o, which only a few
of us use...

The problem is that using c-x;c-o, the "move this sexp
outward" binding, can confuse the paren-matcher. Closing
and re-opening the buffer fixes the problem. Somehow, the 
sequence of operations used by c-x;c-o (deleting a 
chunk, inserting a chunk) breaks some invariant of the
paren-matcher. 

FWIW, I was unable to make this happen without using 
c-x;c-o; this suggests to me that the problem is related
either to the fact that both the cut & paste happen inside
a single edit-sequence, or (more likely) the location
of the selection while the operation is going on. I
guess both of these would be relatively easy to test...
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open new racket buffer, hit a few returns
2) Enter ((a b))
3) put the cursor just before the 'a'
4) hit c-x;c-o
5) move the cursor to the end of the line. observe that
    the close-paren is now highlighted in red, as
    though it's unmatched.

 c-x followed by c-o moves me from one pane to the other, and that's all. =

 D'OH!  I meant control-*C*-control-"o".
 
 It's so deep in my fingers I don't even know what I'm typing.
