Most students are "bad" at formatting their code.

An option to send their code through the pretty-printer would be nice, probably requiring a syntax check and operation on a whole s-exp.

 It would also decide where to put in newlines.
 
 FWIW, the tools interface is designed exactly for things like this.
 
 Also, the port interface is sophisticated to handle this nowadays, even
 dealing with graphical syntax and preserving comments. The way to start
 would be to use open-input-text-editor and work on the port.
 
 Good luck -- let me know if you get stuck :)
