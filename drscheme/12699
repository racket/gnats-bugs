>Description:
I couldn't paste in a pathname using Cmd-V in the open file dialog on a Mac running OS X 10.7.
>How-To-Repeat:
I had a longish path to a file which I'd gotten while browsing sources in Emacs, namely:

/Users/gknauth/test/plt/git/plt/collects/slideshow/tutorial-show.rkt

I didn't want to do lots of point-and-clicking to get to the file in DrRacket, which was already open, so, in Emacs I copied the path to my paste buffer, went into DrRacket, typed Cmd-O to open a file, then Shift-Cmd-G to allow me to paste in the pathname with Cmd-V, but Cmd-V didn't do anything.

I went into TextEdit to make sure the pathname really was properly in the Mac's paste buffer, and the same Cmd-O Shift-Cmd-G trick worked fine in TextEdit.  So I think something in DrRacket on the Mac is blocking access to or nullifying the value of the paste buffer in that particular dialog.

 As a work around, you can open a terminal window and do
 
 open '<cmd-v>'<return>

 That did work, thanks.  That is, it properly opened the file in another tab in the already running DrRacket.
 
 Previously when I'd tried that, it had spawned another DrRacket, but that was my fault, I guess, because I'd been running (without realizing it) the "official" DrRacket via some path, whereas `open;\' actually opens the one I want [and had open this time], namely, the one I build after a git pull and build-from-source.
 
 Thanks for the help.

 FWIW, I've had trouble predicting which DrRacket gets opened the first
 time, but once one is open, 'open' seems to find it reliably.
