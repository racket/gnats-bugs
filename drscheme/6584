>Description:
If the toolbar is hidden through the "view" menu --- which
actually hides both the toolbar and status bar --- then
opening the prefs window unhides the status bar (though not
the toolbar).
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
View -> Hide Toolbar
Edit -> Preferences
 [see that status line re-appeared]
>Fix:
The bug: the state wasn't being checked properly. The centralized
single point of control was missing (organized poorly, anyways).
>Release-Note:
there was no contract violation
