Subject: Bad snip definition can freeze up the interaction window

>Description:
Badly defined snip definitions will kill the interaction window  Subsequent calls to run or break don't appear to work; the interaction window stays frozen.  If the user tries to correct matters and comment out the code in the definition window, and then tries to Run, then CPU usage pegs at 100%.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following into the definition window:
;;;

#lang scheme/base
(require scheme/gui/base
         scheme/class)

(define my-snip%
  (class editor-snip%
    (define/override (copy)
      'erroneous-definition)
    (super-new)))

(new my-snip%)

;;;

Press Run.  An error alert should pop up, and the interaction window should freeze up.  Press Stop twice, and kill the evaluation.  Then comment out the contents of the Definition window.  Press Run.  Then CPU goes to 100%.

 Yes, this is a known security hole in DrScheme. AFAICT, the only thing
 to do is to disallow custom snips being returned to the REPL (or just
 print them out as #<snip> or something). For now, we've opted for the
 less secure route.
