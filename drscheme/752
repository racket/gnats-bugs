>Description:
If a run-time error occurs in a function that was loaded into the
DrScheme interactions window via (load "foo.ss"), the line number that
is included in the error message is 0-based. The number that you should
supply to the "goto line" dialog is 1-based, so you have to add 1 to
actually get to the line containing the error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following function to foo.ss:

(define f
  (lambda (a b)
    (+ a b)))

In a DrScheme evaluations window, execute the following:

(load "foo.ss")
(f 'a 'b)

The resulting error reads:
foo.ss: 2.5-2.11: +: expects type <number> as 1st argument, given: a; other arguments were: b

Load foo.ss into a DrScheme editing window, and hit M-g.  Enter 2 and hit
OK; the cursor is now at the beginning of the line containing
"(lambda (a b)", not the location of the error.

Should be a real easy fix.
