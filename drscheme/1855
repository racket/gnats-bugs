see above
>Fix:

>Release-Note:
the program below seems to demonstrate a problem with
text%. Click on the print button and see that the line
doesn't quite make it over to the `b'.

once this is fixed, perhaps you can switch this pr back to
me? (unless you want to check that the original problem is
fixed and close the pr)

This is under ppc-linux.

(define l-text%
  (class text%
    (field (start-x 0)
           (start-y 0)
           (end-x 0)
           (end-y 0))
    
    (inherit position-location last-position)
    
    (define (find-poss left-pos right-pos)
      (let ([xlb (box 0)]
            [ylb (box 0)]
            [xrb (box 0)]
            [yrb (box 0)])
        (position-location left-pos xlb ylb #t)
        (position-location right-pos xrb yrb #f)
        (values (/ (+ (unbox xlb) (unbox xrb)) 2)
                (/ (+ (unbox ylb) (unbox yrb)) 2))))
    
    (define/override (on-change)
      (set!-values (start-x start-y) (find-poss 0 1))
      (set!-values (end-x end-y) (find-poss (- (last-position) 1) (last-position))))
    
    (define/override (on-paint before dc left top right bottom dx dy draw-caret)
      (send dc draw-line 
            (+ dx start-x)
            (+ dy start-y)
            (+ dx end-x)
            (+ dy end-y)))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define t (make-object l-text%))
