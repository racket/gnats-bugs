>Description:
See below.  This is more of a nitpick than a real bug, but if it's easy to fix and you feel like it....
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute a long-running module program in DrScheme.  In the lower right corner of the window you will see "running".  Switch to a tab which does not have an active computation.  Switch back to the long-running computation.  Now you will see "not running", even though the program is still running.  
>Fix:
The state for running wasn't being store on the tab & updated on tab switches. It is now.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation (or a type error).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 28 Jun 2007 16:05:14 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the report!
