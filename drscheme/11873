>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
I used the "Add Teachpack"->"Add Teachpack to List" command, and when I got back to the DrRacket main window, there were no menus except the DrRacket menu ("File", "Edit", etc. were all missing).  They came back when I opened a source file.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by ryanc at Sat, 23 Apr 2011 21:09:22 -0400
Reason>>> drracket


Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Fri, 17 Jun 2011 04:02:42 -0400
Reason>>> this is something lower level than drracket


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 27 Nov 2011 13:53:51 -0500
Reason>>> I think this class of bugs has been fixed.
