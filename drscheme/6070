>Description:
When you mouse over a module in the Module Browser, the 
edges connected to it change brightness. 

It would be nice if the modules at the other ends of the 
edges also changed visually in some way.  It's not always
clear what's connected because edges can pass through 
unrelated module nodes in the graph.
