>Description:
when providing a struct it is currently nessisary to repeat the names of the fields in the struct. This violates single point of control. I don't that it is possible but I would like to see the repetion removed. I am also plan to write a macro to reduce redudency in contracting a structure.

(define-struct foo (one two three))
(provide/contract
  (make-foo (number? string? boolean? . -> . foo?))
  (foo? (any? . -> . boolean?))
  (foo-one (foo? . -> . number?))
  (set-foo-one! (foo? number? . -> . void?)))

I think contracting functions is very powerful but is difficult to do without duplicating field names. Is there a way to pull the field names out?
