>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
1. start DrScheme and create a module:

    #lang scheme
    1

   Save it as "exe.ss".

2. Try to creaet a MrEd executable distribution; it fails with

    copy-directory/files: encountered  
    /var/folders/3f/3f0of5V6EeiMGerUBA2ABE+++TM/-Tmp-/
    drscheme-tmp-1212155872975095254/exe/exe.app, neither 
    a file nor a directory

The problem seems to depend on either the file name for target
executable name being "exe". Maybe there's a collision with
a temporary directory named "exe".

The problem doesn't seem to happen with a MzScheme executable.
It may also be Mac OS X-specific.
