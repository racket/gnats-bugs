 Hm. I'm not getting this. Are you running Help Desk inside DrScheme?
 Can you tell me which language Help Desk is in? (there is a new
 language menu in Help Desk now) Can you tell me what the serach string
 was?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yes from within DrScheme, seems to occur with any search? However after
 updating from CVS I ran "update all manuals, and encountered a bad zip
 header error when it tried to update (so it may have screwed something up?)
 
  "Teachpacks for How to Design Programs"
 
 I rebuilt everything from scratch, same result?
 
 If I search for "car" for example I get
 
 The following error occured: split-path: expects argument of type <string>;
 given ("/Applications/plt-cvs/plt/collects/algol60" "doc.txt")
 
 So wonder if something in the update manuals process screwed up some index
 references or something?

 Ugh. The error message is very generic, so I'm having trouble tracking
 down what might have happened. I wonder if you would be so kind as to
 try this (time consuming...) procedure to see if you can get a source
 location for the error?
 
   1) run setup-plt -nc
      ;; this should delete all of your .zo files
   2) set the environment variable PLTDRDEBUG (in a terminal window)
      In tcsh, run this command:  setenv PLTDRDEBUG
      in bash, run this command:  export PLTDRDEBUG=1
   3) in the same terminal window, start drscheme:
      /Applications/plt-cvs/plt/bin/drscheme
 
 Now, wait forever as DrScheme starts up...
 
 Then, do the same actions that lead to the bug. If we're lucky, you
 will get a much more detailed error message...

 Well you weren't kidding, after waiting forever for DrScheme to startup,
 which was most of the evening, and then opened and initiated a search in
 the helpdesk, my whole machine locked up a few hours later while doing some
 other stuff in the foreground, then gave up.
 
 Good news however:
 
 - updated from cvs earlier today, re-built, deleted my prefs file, same
 problem; but then updated the docs, which didn't get an header error on
 trying to unpack "Teachpacks ..." this time, and every thing was then fine;
 so it would seem that the error during unpacking hosed some index file or
 something which could only be corrected by having the previously failed
 unpack operation succeed.
 
 Thanks again,

 (any chance of getting the "search in files..." moved over to the file menu
 prior to 3.0, as I suspect its presence shouldn't likely be a function of a
 presently open window which is implied now by being under edit which
 disappears when now windows are presently open; but do understand that
 you've already likely got your hands full).

State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Tue Dec 30 04:55:07 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    fixed (soon to be released to cvs, but not yet)
    
    the bug only showed up when there were some manuals that
    the system knew about, but weren't installed yet (the teachpack
    manual, in particular triggered this for Paul).
