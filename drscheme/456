>Description:
A combination of load, define-macro, and a syntax error can
break DrScheme. The message for the syntax error is printed,
followed by

  continuation application: attempt to jump into an escape continuation
>How-To-Repeat:
Put this in a file:

 (define-macro package
  (lambda (x . args)
    (car 'package)))

 (1 . 2)

and try to load it in DrScheme Quasi-R4RS.

State-Changed-Why:

fixed, not yet released.

Believe it or not, I needed fluid-let to fix this bug! When the evaluator
was called recursively and an error orccurred this bug was triggered. So,
this expression:

  (eval '(define-macro m 1))

also triggered the bug. This second expression should go into the test
suite.
