>Description:
I'm using the internal PLT browser, (i.e. not Netscrape.)  If I paste code from the internal PLT browser to the DrScheme window, there's often garbage in the whitespace which DrScheme balks at.
>How-To-Repeat:
drscheme &

I use the internal PLT browser to search for cons, and I'm at the R5RS page looking like 

procedure:  (cons obj1 obj2) 

Returns a newly allocated pair whose car is obj1 and whose cdr is obj2. The pair is guaranteed to be different (in the sense of eqv?) from every existing object.

(cons 'a '())                   ===>  (a)


So I select the first expression and paste it into the Drscheme window, and execute it:

(cons 'a '())   

I get the error message:

reference to undefined identifier: cons 

Now the phrase is "pinked out":

cons 

and I notice that the "space" after cons is pink.  So I delete it, and now I have a different error message:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 203.
Language: Pretty Big (includes MrEd and Advanced) custom.
(a )
. reference to undefined identifier:    

What's pink now is just the "space" after the expression:

(cons 'a '())     

So I delete this "space", and I'm fine:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 203.
Language: Pretty Big (includes MrEd and Advanced) custom.
(a )

 Thanks for the bug report. This has been fixed for our next release. If
 you're anxious for the fix, it has been released to our CVS archive.
 
 Right now, DrScheme silently converts the non-breaking spaces into
 spaces, but we're debating if the user should be informed, or even
 given the chance to allow the non-breaking spaces in their program, so
 I'll leave this PR open for the time being.
 
 Thanks again!

Reason>>> drscheme converts non-breaking spaces to regular spaces now.
