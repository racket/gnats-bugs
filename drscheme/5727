Human Language: english
>Description:
In the DrS FAQ, the question about why DrScheme runs so slowly
says something about turning off debugging.  The language
choices don't mention debugging.

With Zodiac gone, I think that question can be excised from
the FAQ.

 Some languages still have debugging and it still
 helps in those languages. I will revise this 
 entry.
 
 Thanks,

State-Changed-Why:
    The FAQ seems to be correct, from what I read. Turning on debugging does indeed slow down certain language levels and the FAQ doesn't say it is in all languages. I've improved the wording slighly, but it seemed okay to begin with.
