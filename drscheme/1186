Solaris
>Description:
Affects students (if they use PS to pringt assignments) because they
lose points for indentation.  Otherwise non-critical.  I've told
them to print files w/o PS for now.

>How-To-Repeat:
Write a simple program with a 2-branch cond in definitions window,
then preview ps.  Second branch will be indented wrong.

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed MrEd to support a decent solution: face and family settings
are orthogonal.

I think the final piece of the puzzle is to change
  (send scheme-delta set-delta-face name)
in drscheme/prefs.ss to 
  (send scheme-delta set-delta-face name 'modern)

Robby: should I do this, or would you like to take over the PR?

 I have done this, but not yet released that code and it works under
 unix. I will claim the PR and close it when I release.
