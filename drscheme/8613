 I think that this one is something mred would have to support directly
 too, right?

 Doesn't that one normally go in the "Windows" menu? (MrEd does offer a
 `minimize' method.)

 Looks like it is called "iconize". Do you mind putting an index entry
 in for minimize that goes to the iconize method?

 Do you know if the minimize and zoom menus should be called specific
 things (other than "minimize" and "zoom") under windows & linux?
 
 I looked at windows and neither IE nor thunderbird have minimize/zoom
 under the view menu, or under any other menu I could find.
 
 That suggests I shouldn't put them there for windows, I guess?
 
 What about linux? I don't know what the right apps to emulate are there.

 Okay, I've added this, but it only shows up under mac os x.
 
 According to other apps I've tried, zoom is stateful: if the window is
 zoomed, it shrinks it back, otherwise zooms it.
 
 I don't see how to find out if a window is zoomed, however, so for now
 drscheme just always passes #t to maximize when the zoom menu is
 chosen.
 
 Can I do better?
 
 Thanks,

 I think that under both worlds "maximize" is the common term.  (I
 didn't even know that "zoom" can be used for maximizing a window.)

 I don't think that I ever saw an application that had menu entries for
 them.

 No, that's wrong.

 Probably same thing as above: you're not looking at a mac.
 
 On the mac, finder, safari, and firefox all have "minimize" and "zoom"
 as menu items, right in the same place and in the same order.
 
 Probably it is in some mac interface book somewhere.

 I don't know what "that" is referring to.  It's easy to see that it's
 right on Windows: a help search for "maximize" gets some relevant
 results, and searching for zoom brings pages about the Windows
 "Magnifier" thing.

 Right -- I was talking about the two alternatives, Linux and Windows.

 Ugh. I really can't read today. Maybe its time to take a nap.
 
 Thanks for the feedback.
 
 Sounds like you're in agreement with what I ended up doing, then? Just
 not having the menus at all under windows & linux?

 Will do. I'll also remove the claim "iconize" has no effect on Mac OS.

 I'll add `is-maximized?'. I think it's currenty missing because I can't
 implement it under X, but as I understand it, a method that works just
 under Mac OS would work for you (and it won't hurt if it also works
 under Windows).

 Do you mind also adding the 'not' and call ot that method to group.ss?
 Right near where maximize is currently called in the zoom menu
 callback? (When you're done, anyways)?
