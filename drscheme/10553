>Description:
I often use C-e to switch to the definitions window without using the mouse, edit
some, and re-run.  If the editing happens in the bottom of a file that is longer
than the screen, then when the interactions show up they'll cover whatever I just
wrote.  (This is especially annoying in class.)

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
DrScheme now pays attention to the focus when doing control-e. If the focus does not change, it scrolls to make sure the insertion point is still visible. 
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract error, nor was it a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sun, 01 Nov 2009 06:23:34 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.
