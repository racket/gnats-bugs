>Description:
The problem seems to be in Dr. Scheme. I defined the following 
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess)
    (if (good-enough? guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0))

I am getting the following error

define: found a definition that is not at the top level

I tried it with different pieces of code from the following book
Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman
and Julie Sussman
Dr. Scheme gives the same message

I really need to get this problem solved since I'd like to use lexical scoping and not have to enter parameters every time for short code segments. I'm using the advanced level of Dr. Scheme. Thanks much.

>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following code piece

(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess)
    (if (good-enough? guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0))

You will see the following error
define: found a definition that is not at the top level

 Try this in advanced:

 (local (
 >   (define (good-enough? guess)
 >     (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
 >   (define (improve guess)

 The languages that you are using (beginner, intermediate, advanced) are
 designed for the text How to Design Programs, not Abelson and Sussman. 
 
 Try using the "Textual" or "Graphical" or "Pretty Bug" language.

 I found it. Thanks so much. I found the language choice under PLT. It had a 
 choice called "Pretty Big" and it says it includes Mr. Ed and Advanced. I got 
 my algorithms working with that option.
