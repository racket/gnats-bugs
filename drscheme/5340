>Description:
create a mzscheme executable from 
drscheme (in mzscheme/text) that 
uses a require. when you launch 
the program it produces this error 
message: 

 collection not found: "lang" in any of: ()

even though mzscheme run in the same
world knows about the path. 


>How-To-Repeat:
write program in Full, put this atop
(require (lib "htdp-full-text.ss" "lang"))
stick in mzscheme mode, and create
executable from within drscheme. 
>Fix:
Now, all executables created in plt>MrEd and plt>MzScheme
are launchers -- there are no standalone executables.

 Not if you put mzscheme.exe in the same place as the created
 executable, right?
 
 I think the solution is a dialog in DrScheme, when the user tries to
 make a "stand-alone" executable based on the MzScheme/MrEd language,
 that says:
 
   Are you sure? Didn't you mean to use `module' instead? You know that
   this probably won't work if the executable isn't in PLTHOME, unless
   you completely avoid `require'?
 
 (Launchers for MzScheme/MrEd should work, because they embed a path and
 aren't expected to be moved.)

 Correct. If you copy the executable, you get the same problem.

 About standalone executables in non-module, non-teaching languages: I'm
 thinking that we just shouldn't allow standalone launchers in those
 languages. Given all the restrictions on them, it's not clear that they
 actually do anything better than launchers would.
 
 Would it be okay if I just disallowed them?
