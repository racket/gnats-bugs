>Description:
The "Description" and "Steps to Reproduce" fields don't support
undo.

Probably it's just a matter of enabling the undo stack on the
relevant editors.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
added a call to set-max-undo-history
>Release-Note:
This is not a contract violation, nor a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 14 May 2008 19:08:36 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN
