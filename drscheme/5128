>Description:
open two files with same name in drscheme 
there is no easy way to distinguish them
you have to read the first few lines (now
if the first n lines are also the same it
gets really awkward) 

i propose to prefix the name with the name of
the directory. for the case when they are the 
same, let's wait for the next feature request.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    currently, the best way to do this is to click on the
    filename in the top-right of the window. tis produces
    a pop-up menu with each directory as a separate
    menu item.
