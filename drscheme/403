This document has an error:  The second executable line is

  (define w (open-viewport practice 300 300))

but at this point `practice' is unbound.  I assume a string was
intended instead.

Also, I don't like the placement of comments in the document.  I think
they would be more helpful if they were placed after the lines rather
than before.  (Read the document in question and it'll make sense.)

Also, the next document -- ... | A More Complicated Example -- has TeX 
stuff in the comments, which makes no sense in HTML.
