>Description:
This may be a feature for which I could not find documentation,
rather than a bug...

Encountered a couple cases in which the arrows that are drawn in
the text editor window based on Check Syntax information were
drawn extending up past the start of the text buffer or down past
the end.  This behavior occurred for arrows drawn from variables
in `provide' form that were imported from modules required by this
module, and also for arrows drawn from the require forms from
which some imported variables were provided by this module.

 (It's "ssax.ss" from "http://www.neilvandyke.org/ssax-plt/ssax-20020402.plt".)

 That's the problem, I think. With longer files like that, the 
 coordinates wrap around. It's on my list of things to fix.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
