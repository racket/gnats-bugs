 Just to make sure we're clear, anyone have a precise list (or can
 point me to the section in the docs)?
 
 Thanks,

 I don't know if that's exhaustive, but it looks complete to me.
 
 P.S.  This is my first opportunity to play around with the new
 version, and as I try it, I'm thinking of minor feature requests, like
 a function here or there that would make the base set of functions
 feel more complete.  I know that your major focus this instant is on
 fixing any remaining bugs that prevent 4.0 from shipping.  So what's
 the correct venue for reporting these suggestions?  Should I go ahead
 and file suggestions with the bug system as non-critical feature
 requests (that's what I've been doing), or would you rather me make
 these suggestions in a different way or at a different time?

 Feature request PRs seems fine to me.
 
 You might want to discuss them on plt-scheme first, tho, just to make
 sure that there isn't something simple that's close that's already
 there.
