 The color in the latest vesion of drscheme is much easier to see. I'm
 surprised you say 4.1.3.4 there, when 4.1.3.4 doesn't seem to use red
 & black ...

 I just said red...  In any case, any change in the fg color or in the
 font (like adding an underline) is going to be similarly hard to spot.

 Is the issue here that Eli is using write-on-black mode, and so the
 black background that is normally put behind unexecuted code is
 invisible (i.e., there isn't a background change when the background is
 already black)?

 Oh! I somehow assumed you were using the teaching languages. Try
 those. Is that better?
 
 But I need to make it configurable anyway, I think. Mike seems to
 prefer something tha tlooks like the selection and I can't, in good
 conscience, have that be a default setting.
 
 FWIW, I've just realized that I have a deadline in a few days for a
 proposal that doesn't yet exist. So I won't be doing anything soon.
 (That's where the stress evident in my earlier messages comes from.)

 1. I did.
 2. I said "red", not "red and black".
 3. Uncovered expressions, in what I'm seeing, have a red fg color.
 4. Except for the fg color change, there is no other difference.

 No, I'm using the default white-bg configuration.  If there should be
 a background change then I'm definitely not seeing it.

 Sorry again (in public :). I have changed the teaching languages, and
 will change the others when I get done with a bunch of changes to that
 and related things.

 Ah -- much better.  (I only use the teaching languages for about 1.5
 classes at the beginning of each semester.)  It's actually a little
 too extreme IMO, so a configuration would be nice -- but any bg color
 change is definitely better than the red/green thing.

 I completely agree with that.  If it looks like the selection, I'd
 expect it to *be* the selection.

 That's perfectly fine with me.  I just wanted to say it so I won't
 forget it.  (I now remember that there was a discussion about it, but
 I didn't follow the details.)
