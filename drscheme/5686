>Description:
If you click on the "Take a Tour" link from the DrScheme
About box, you do get the Tour in a browser.

But the links in the Tour don't work, because they assume
the Help Desk server is running.

I think the solution is for this link to start the server
and surf to the URL that server understands for the Tour:

  http://127.0.0.1:port/doc/tour/
