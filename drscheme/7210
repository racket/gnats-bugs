>Description:
the keybindings dialog specifies several
keystroke shortcuts that do not function as advertised.
>How-To-Repeat:
open up the keybindings dialog, 
scroll down to the various "end-of-line", 
see that they indicate 4 different ways:
(c:e)
(d:RIGHT)
(m:RIGHT)
(END)

try each, find that only "END" and "m:RIGHT" (interpretted as ESC;RIGHT) work.
>Fix:
the normalization procedure did not normalize "return" and "enter" (same for other shorthands).

due to one bug, menu shortcuts were not overriding anything. when that was fixed, the menu keybindings were not overriding shortcuts that contained the menu keybinding inside them.
>Release-Note:
there were no contract violations for this.

 The keybinding
 
    d:Right
 
 uses a modifier that is not available under windows (it's the mac's
 "cmd" key).
 
 FWIW, the c:e binding is being superceeded by the menu shortcut.

 I just tried and, on the mac, the keybindings dialog correctly filters
 out menu key bindings. It doesn't seem to be doing that under Windows
 (at least in 207)
 
 Do either of you have a windows computer to try that on?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yes, c:e for end-of-line is still there in v299.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 29 Jan 2005 16:07:33 -0500
Reason>>> I've found several problems with the way the keybindings dialog reported the 
available keybindings and fixed them. c:e is no longer visible (unless menu 
shortcuts are disabled) and esc;c:semicolon is also no longer visible (unless 
menu shortcuts are disabled) since that actually gets intercepted by the 
prefernces dialog.

also, Matthew fixed a bug to make c:semicolon even work at all.

This is all released our CVS version, and will be in the next release.
