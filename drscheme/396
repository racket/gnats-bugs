 I am pretty convinced that the bug is in DrScheme, not M3.  However, I
 have no way of checking it.  It appears that the vocabularies -- being
 created by DrScheme -- for intermediate and advanced are being
 inadvertently swapped.  That would be consistent with this error.
 
 However, when I try to print out the vocabulary names, all I get is
 
 vocab: scheme-w/user-defined-macros/drscheme
 vocab: scheme-w/user-defined-macros/drscheme
 vocab: scheme-w/user-defined-macros/drscheme
 
 so I can't investigate further.  If the above tip turns out to be
 incorrect, make the vocabulary names more descriptive and let me know.

In fact they were swapped. Fixed, not yet released.
