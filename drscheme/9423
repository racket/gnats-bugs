>Description:
Bringing up the DrScheme prefs box and then hitting cancel (while performing no additional actions) consistently overwrites my syntax-highlighting color choices with the built-in defaults.  It doesn't seem to affect any of my other preference settings.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.  In the prefs box, change the colors for lexical and imported variables to something different (make 'em both green, just to be obvious about it).

Quit & restart DrScheme.

Enter the following into the definitions window:
#lang scheme
(define f
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
        1
        (* n (f (sub1 n))))))

Hit Check Syntax (I used F6).  You should see the identifiers become the colors that you selected above.

Now, hit cmd-, to bring up the prefs box.  Click cancel in the prefs box.  The check-syntax colors have now reverted back to their factory defaults of light blue and slightly darker blue.

This also affects the online syntax highlighting colors for Scheme, as well as the color for paren highlighting.  I don't know if it affects the REPL or Java colors, or the background color, since I haven't changed those from the factory defaults.
>Fix:
The way the black & white preferences worked was by setting a callback so that each time the preference was set, it would call some function to set all of the other color preferences. 

In addition, cancelling the prefernces dialog effectively does a preferences set (including callback check) of all of the preferences, saved from when the window was opened. 

So, sometimes depending on the order things are traversed in some hash-table somewhere, cancelling the dialog would revert the colors of the text.

 I believe I just fixed this bug, thanks to a PR from Philippe in the
 last few days.
 
 (Amazing that two people notice this years after the bug was
 introduced, but within days of each other.)

 Is this fix in SVN?  Because I just updated a little over an hour ago and
 rebuilt, and I'm still seeing the behavior.

 Oh, boy! There were two bugs. At first I thought I was going crazy to
 see this back and to verify that my fix really had been put in, but a
 little more detective work made me realize that the bug was still
 there, but could be masked by a lucky ordering of a hash-table
 traversal, so I guess that's what was happening to me the other night
 when I fixed Philippe's version.
 
 Anyways, thanks for the report. The fix should be in SVN now.
 
 Note that I had to change the way the black-on-white and
 white-on-black buttons work, so if you see problems there, pls. let me
 know.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yup, that fixed it.  Thanks!
