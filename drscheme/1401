>Description:
In either DrScheme window, if I type too many close
parens to a top-level expression, the editor pops
up a window saying "/: division by zero"

This is a *very* annoying bug. I find it hard to
believe that it has escaped into the hands of
students without being fixed...
>How-To-Repeat:
type any expression with too many close parens
into an interaction window. I did:

QUOTE-CHAR OPAREN 1 CPAREN CPAREN

QUOTE-CHAR == '
OPAREN == (
CPAREN == )

Note that I need to use a symbolic representation
of the charaters because typing the expression
make this message window non-functional...

 Tell me about your setup.  Is this a monochrome monitor? How many 
 colors can your system display?  My suspicion is that this error is 
 occurring because of the highlight color calculation that occurs in 
 drscheme when an error arises.

 Under UNIX, I notice that the unmatched paren highlight color is not 
 the same as the highlight color used when syntactic or runtime errors 
 occur. On the mac, they're the same color.  Which of these 
 calculations is going through my color-match library?  I'm wondering 
 whether the division by zero is occurring there.
 
 In fact, I've noticed that I don't explicitly check whether (when 
 inverting a matrix) the determinant is zero. I think this would occur 
 on a monochrome monitor. I think.  Do you know of a way to set a unix 
 machine to some kind of monochrome mode?

 All of the color calculations should be using your library. Both use the
 highlight-range call which uses your library. Shouldn't you be able to put
 your mac into b/w mode?

 Newer macs (including probably every one I can get my hands on) have 
 no color depth less than 8-bit. So no, that won't work.  I spent a 
 while today trying to get X to come up in monochrome, but the closest 
 I could get was a grayscale, and the bug was not reproducible there.

 If you have a linux machine, you can didle /etc/..../XF86Config to make it
 monochrome, I think.
 
 But, perhaps it is easier to interpose on mred to test the library directly?
 You can make a unit that exports mred^ but "override" get-display-depth to
 return whatever you want. Or, some other way to "simulate" 2d and write a
 test suite for your code.

 After inspecting the code in color-model.ss, I'm convinced that a 
 divide by zero  cannot occur in that code.  In particular, none of 
 the use of division in that unit is parameterized (in its quotient) 
 by any inputs at all.  In other words, the quotients of all division 
 are completely fixed.
 
 So... back to square one.

 Hi!
 
 Thanks for the bug report. Sorry it has taken so long to get back to 
 you. We thought we knew the problem, but now we aren't so sure. I am 
 writing to ask you a few questions about your machine (as you point 
 out in your original PR submission -- this bug is surprisingly 
 obvious :)
 
 Do you have a color monitor or a b/w monitor? Are there any other 
 special characteristics of your machine that you think might trigger 
 this bug? Do you have more than one machine? If so, do you see the 
 problem on all of you machines?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Thanks for the response! That helps a great deal. I found the problem

 The problem is in the color-model.ss file in plt/collects/framework. 
 Here's one way to reproduce it:
 
 (require-library "refer.ss")
 (require-library "frameworks.ss" "framework")
 (define-values/invoke-unit/sig
   framework:color-model^
   (compound-unit/sig
     (import)
     (link [f : mzlib:function^ ((require-library "functior.ss"))]
           [c : framework:color-model^
              ((require-library "color-model.ss" "framework") f)])
     (export (open c))))
 (rgb-color-distance 0 0 0 20 20 20)

 	`Robert Findler' made changes to this PR.
 
 I transferred the responsibility to you. You are, of course, free to mess
 with color-model.ss in the framework collection.
