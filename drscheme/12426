>Description:
Within DrRacket, when a file has an embedded image snip, it can not be required by other files if the debugging dynamic language property is enabled.  If it's on, the user will see:

   write: cannot marshal value that is embedded in compiled code: (object:image% ...)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create one file f1.rkt whose content contains an image snip.  Create a file f2.rkt that requires f1.  Make sure the language options has "Debugging" on.  Running f2 should emit the error message in DrRacket.
