 The short answer: don't use MREDDEBUG.
 
 What do you want to use it?

 Well, that error message comes after all of the files are loaded and
 only in 200, so I doubt fixing it is going to help.
 
 Sorry,

 Ah, okay. I've known about that problem for sometime, as it turns out.
 I just haven't figured out the best way to solve it.

State-Changed-Why:
    this doesn't happen anymore.
    
    to fix this, I changed errortrace so that it doesn't
    instrument code unless the current namespace is
    the same namespace as where errortrace was installed.
