>Description:
I kept noticing that paren matching and sexp hiliting were
screwed up in my program, but I couldn't locate the source of the problem. I didn't think to check the parentheses in my comment blocks. For whatever reason I hadn't been bitten by this for a really long time, so I had assumed it wasn't an issue any more.

>How-To-Repeat:
#|
A foo is a structure
   (make-foo a b (c)
|#

(define (foo a) (b c d)))
