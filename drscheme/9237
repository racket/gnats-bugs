>Description:
When I type a line that has more than one complete expression on it, the following line indents to line up with the second expression, rather than the first.

I've submitted this bug report at least once or twice before, but the bug still appears in version 371.
>How-To-Repeat:
(cube 5) "should be" 125
         next line is indented here, rather than at left margin
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
One could argue that this was a change request, since it seems
to have been intentional to do things this way, but I can see
how this behavior is not desireable, so I've left it as a bug.

Not a type error. Not a contract violation.

 If you can recall the PR numbers for the old PRs that would be helpful.
 
 Thanks,
