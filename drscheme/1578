>Description:
DrScheme ignores break requests while parsing a file.

(I'm working on a large unit, and I keep accidentally hitting
Meta-T (bound to "execute" via the menus) in an attempt to 
transpose words.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
load a large unit (prettyr.ss should do)
Click execute
Click break => nothing happens

 Is this a Zodiac problem?  If so, how do you propose fixing this?  Is
 there some equivalent to yield's that Zodiac should call, perhaps on
 each expand-expr (that should be enough granularity)?
 
 Advice appreciated.

 Quoting Shriram Krishnamurthi:
 > Is this a Zodiac problem? 
 
 I don't think so. I think DrScheme just disables breaks while parsing
 code.
