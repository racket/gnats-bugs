>Description:
Will not load. Loaded in 369.7.

Program has a large jave comment box with text and an image (picture of the uml diagram)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try loading it.
>Fix:
This bug was, as Matthew surmised, a call to read-line 
that was catching the GUI syntax. It has been fixed now.

The actual error was this:

read-byte: non-character in an unsupported context, from port: #<input-port>

 I think you probably wanted to include a file, but our bug-report
 system has no easy way to do that. Can you forward it as response to
 this message?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 This seems to a problem with DrScheme's new auto-detection of a file's
 language.
 
 Steps to reproduce:
 
  1. In a fresh DrScheme buffer, insert a comment box.
  2. Save to a file.
  3. Close it.
  4. Try to open the file again.
 
 It looks like language detection uses functions like `read-line', which
 don't work with non-text items in the stream.

 Thanks for the report Emil and the clue Matthew. That was it and it is
 fixed now.
 
 FWIW, it is very handy to actually have the error output instead of
 "It will not load" and "try loading it", particularly since "load" is
 a technical term in Scheme and it was used it with a different meaning
 that the technical one.
 
 Robby
