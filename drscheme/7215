>Submitter-Id:   unknown
>Release:        299.27-cvs13jan2005
>Environment:
linux-redhat
>Description:
Pressing Control-R in the definitions or interactions window of DrScheme causes an internal DrScheme error:

send: target is not an object: #f for method: has-focus?
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme in Linux (presumably any X system), click in the definitions window, and press Control-R.

I've tried to replicate the problem in Windows and MacOS X, and I don't think it exists on those platforms.
>Fix:
the control-r keybinding was assuming that the user had dock'd the search
window. the fix is just to add a cond and hand the case where it wasn't
docked properly.
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation, with the blame right.

 Is control-r a menu shortcut in your setup?
 
 Thanks,

 It doesn't show up on the menu--the only keybindings on the menu use the
 "Meta" modifier.
 
 When I select Edit | Keybindings, one of the items in the list is
 
     c:r (move-to-search-or-reverse-search)
 
 hth,
 Ryan

Reason>>> fixed and released to CVS. control-r now searches backwards properly.
