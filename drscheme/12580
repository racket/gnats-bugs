>Description:
This code fails fine:

    (define (foo #:x [x 1]) x)
    (foo 1)

But if a bad keyword is used:

    (define (foo #:x [x 1]) x)
    (foo #:y 1)

then the error is shown as coming from racket/private/kw.rkt:1232:14.

Also, it looks like there's a different problem with required keywords:

    (define (foo #:x x) x)
    (foo 1)

this reports an error from "struct foo".

 This is a drr problem, which shows up with no debugging or with
 coverage on.  For reference, the error is:
 
   racket/collects/racket/private/kw.rkt:1232:14: foo: does not expect
   an argument with keyword #:y; arguments were: #:y 1
 
 Running it in racket shows that place only in the context:
 
   foo: does not expect an argument with keyword #:y; arguments were: #:y 1
    === context ===

 Can you file a separate bug for this, which seems unrelated to DrR?

 I do not see that in drracket. I see this:
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.2.1.6--2012-02-15(df5e7ef/g) [3m].
 Language: racket/base [custom]; memory limit: 128 MB.

 I put the program you sent prefixed by "#lang racket/base" in the
 definitions window and hit "Run", with the default module language
 settings, except disabling debugging, and enabling test coverage. Both
 look the same.

 Done, so it should be ignored in this PR.

 In version: 5.2.1.5--2012-02-09(36527c5/g) I see the same thing as Eli
 with the following choices:
  - Syntactic test coverage
  - No debugging
 
 I see the same thing as Robby with the following choices:
  - Debugging
  - Debugging & profiling

 I tried it with the nightly build too, I get the same:
 
   Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.2.1.6--2012-02-16(aa85692/a) [3m].
   Language: racket/base [custom]; memory limit: 256 MB.

 Maybe it's due to some x86_64 difference?
 
 Actually, I tried it on the i386 machine, and got the same.

 (Yes, my tests were on two linux boxes, and Sam likely did the same.)

 FWIW, my windows is a win7 64 bit machine (and I've got a 32bit
 drracket, I'm pretty sure).

 Aha -- on the win7 64bit machine I get the same as you, but on the
 xp/i386 machine I do see the problem.
