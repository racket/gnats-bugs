(save-image (triangle 40 "solid" "orange") "orange-triangle.png")
works nicely if it's in the interactions or definitions pane of a window associated with a saved file.  But if you type the same thing in a new window NOT associated with a saved file, it saves the file to the root directory.  (I don't know what it does if the user doesn't have write access to the root....)

I would suggest that a more user-friendly default is either
(a) the user's home directory, whatever that means on the local filesystem;
(b) the "desktop", if there is such a thing on the local filesystem; or
(c) an error message.

 If I understand correctly, drracket is currently inheriting this
 behavior from the OS. I believe it uses the current directory of
 drracket itself when the file is not saved.
 
 There are multiple levels one could adjust this: change drracket's
 interaction with the os for the default initial directory if there is
 no saved file, do similar but only for the teaching languages, or try
 to do something in the image library (but its hard to see how
 something would work there).
 
 I'm not sure what's best.

 This problem comes up for batch-io, too. It writes to root=20
 or some such place if you run a program w/o saving it.=20
 
 Some stringent but workable solutions are:=20
 =20
 1. Disable run until the file has been saved a first time.=20
 
 2. Use the user's home directory as the current directory=20
 	until saved=20

 I think that the default directory could be fruitfully changed, but
 I'm not sure if drracket should do it or if something lower should and
 I'm not sure if there are lurking problems there.

 That last proposal is a huge change to the system. It sounds like a

 The racket primitive current-directory is used a fair amount.  (I
 count 325 uses in the collects tree and that's just our code.) If its
 contract changed, there would be a lot of thinking about the
 implications.
 
 And your response makes me think we're maybe talking past each other.
 I'm talking about Stephen Bloch's proposal that current-directory's
 contract change (and your support for that proposal).

 FWIW, I don't know of any flag like that. There is a "is this file
 saved" flag, tho, which may play a role somehow.

 I interpreted Stephen's proposal like this:=20
 
 1. Set up some flag in DrRacket that says "the current directory isn't =
 determined." My hunch is that this flag is already around.=20
 
 2. BEFORE you set the current-directory parameter for DrRacket programs, =
 check this flag. Don't see it .. .
 
 And now I realize why this doesn't work. The contract for =
 current-directory doesn't include a bad value. But we do wish to run =
 even if there is no current directory. Only primitives that read/write =
 should blow up.=20
 
 Sorry, I am back to my own proposal which says "set it to user's home".=20=
