 Robby, I just looked at the documentation and realized that nobody had ever
 gone thru the trouble of defining the higher-order primitives that Scheme 
 includes. 
 
 The documentation was intentionally left underspecified for 102. To base 
 the languages on it w/o further refinement, was extremely premature.
