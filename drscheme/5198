>Description:
I set my notify-on-buffer-change warning to happen
"only once".  However, once seems to be less frequent
than it was on v103.  After I execute, I can make
changes in my buffer, and I see no warnings at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
New DrScheme.
Try some exprs in Interactions.
Type space in Definitions.
Type expr in Interactions.
You see the warning (only once).
Execute.
Type an expr in Interactions.  No warning (of course).
Now delete the space in Definitions.
Type another expr in Interactions.  NO WARNING.

I think this is really a bug -- looks like some global
state isn't being reset.
>Fix:
the problem was indeed that some state wasn't
getting reset.

I suppose there could have been a contract that
said that when execute was called, certain internal
state is set a certain way. This would certainly 
be useful documentation, but would violate our
"don't panic on the titanic" maxim, since the 
state was all internal to the implementation of
the REPL.
