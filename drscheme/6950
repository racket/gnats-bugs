I'm not going to do the work to find all the rest. But there
are several of them. Happy hunting.

Sorry.
>How-To-Repeat:
For example, try this:
(note: this is by no-means exhaustive)

1. Open help-desk
2. In the query box, type "get-langauge-numbers"
3. Choose the first link in the list of four links
4. Click on the link embedded in the sentence: "This method is the same 
as get-language-numbers."

Results:
This is a useless circular link. Not helpful either.

 I believe that these docs are build using some kind of Scheme voodoo
 that Robby does (I will move it to him now).  Because of this, it will
 probably be good if you can provide a few more examples that will
 identify how the scripts should make (assuming that there are other
 circularities that look different).

 No voodoo in this case (just .cdb files).
