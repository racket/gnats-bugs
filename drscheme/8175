>Description:
The program contour window does not react to scroll events immediately after switching to a different tab, until I click in the contour window itself.  At that point it reacts normally until I switch tabs again.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enable the program contour window in DrScheme.  Open two tabs, one with a multiple-page program.  Switch to that program from the other tab.  Scroll the program up and down with the mouse wheel, scrollbar, or keys.  The program contour window will not react.  Now click in the program contour window, then scroll around again.  Now it will react.
