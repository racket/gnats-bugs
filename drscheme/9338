>Description:
While copying and pasting an image into drscheme, it either pastes the URL or that there is an error saying that the image has errors.  I am using firefox and linux.  I can copy and paste from drscheme to drscheme without a problem. The image pastes correctly in other applications like OpenOffice in both cases.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copy an image from Firefox
Open up DrScheme
Paste the Image
