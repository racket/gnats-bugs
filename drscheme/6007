>Description:
When you click on the page icon that appears next to an error message, it opens the file in which the error occurred.  However, it does not check to see whether that file is already open.  This results in multiple non-synchronized windows open on the same document, which can be really dangerous. Yikes!
>How-To-Repeat:
Open two windows.  In one window, enter a buggy program. Save it.  In the second, write a program which requires the first. Execute the second so that an error message shows up with a page icon next to it.  Click on the page icon. Now you have two windows open on the same document.

 This doesn't happen for me. I wonder if you have something special 
 about your filesystem that normalize-path isn't working for. What was 
 the path to the file in question?

 I now suspect that the problem was a pathname with capital letters in 
 it.  In MacOS, these are the same file, but DrScheme thinks they're 
 different.  I guess the solution would be to compare pathnames 
 differently on different platforms, but at the very least this is not a 
 problem with the bug icon.  I'll close it, unless there are any 
 objections.

 I don't think so -- /Users/robby/tmp has capitol letters and there
 wasn't a problem. If you could please send the path name that would help.

 It's not a platform issue; it's a filesystem issue. (I routinely work
 with an NFS-mounted, case-sensitive filesystem in OS X.) And that makes
 it much more difficult to properly compare path strings, if it's even
 possible.

 Okey dokey.
 
 1) I create a directory called /Users/clements/foo
 2) I open a new DrScheme window, enter (car ()), and save it as foo/p.ss
 3) I open a new DrScheme window, and enter the program (load 
 "/Users/clements/FOO/p.ss")
 4) I try to execute.
 4.5) I change the language level from module to pretty-big :)
 5) I execute and get the bug & document icons.
 6) I click on the document icon.
 7) i get the "are you sure you want to switch because this file isn't 
 saved" dialog
 8) I click okay, and the current window switches to be p.ss.  Now I 
 have two of them.
 
 Does this work for you?

 If normal-case-path were to look at the filesystem (determining if
 subpaths were case-insensitive or not) would that solve the problem
 (not that that's possible, but I'm just curious if there's more to it
 than that)?
 
 Im imaginging something where, under OS X with Matthew's setup,
 (normal-case-path "/PaTh/TO/NfS/home/mflatt/Projects") would produce
 "/path/to/nfs/home/mflatt/Projects".
 
 Or, possibly, this could even be folded into normalize-path; and for
 printing out pathnames, we could have normalize-path/preserve-case that
 would try to preserve the case sensitivity of its input where the input
 didn't matter.

 The path can be done, sortof (note that there's a C library function
 realpath() on some platforms), but I don't know how to do the filename
 part without actually creating the file. In any case, it seems too
 fragile.
 
 Probably the only solution is avoid normalization, and instead rely on
 a dev+inode identification for open files. That would be reliable (or
 as reliable as we can make it).

 I don't think that this works, in general. The files I'm comparing
 aren't open in the filesystem sense (only open in the drscheme sense of
 "being viewed in a window")
