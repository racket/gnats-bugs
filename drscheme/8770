>Description:
Here's a fun one for you Robby:

 - on Windows insert a USB stick
 - open and save a file on the drive
 - switch to a new tab
 - disconnect the USB stick 
 - press CTRL+T to make a new tab

Now internal error messages appear on standard out,
and DrScheme has problems updating the interaction
window.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The calls to normalize path shouldn't happen if the file doesn't exist. So, now they don't.

Also, there was a second place in the code that did the same thing (the file system popup menu) and that's fixed now too.
>Release-Note:
Both bugs were contract violations (both abuses of normalize-path).

These would not have been type errors.

 Can I make any assumptions about the filename returned from get-editor?
 
 Should I ever be normalizing it?
 
 For example, for the popup menu in the upper-left of drs's window. It
 is currently being normalized to get the path elements for the menu,
 but maybe that's not a good idea. Thoughts?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

Reason>>> 

Thanks for the report. I was able to reproduce the same
thing under mac os by taking out a disk and I think I've
fixed the problem.

Do let me know if you still see issues.
