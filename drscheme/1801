Note this error message:

What I notice is that the directory delimiter "/" is incorrectly used instead of ":".

 Thanks for the bug report. This will be fixed for the next release. In
 the meantime, to read the graphics documentation, follow the "Manuals"
 link from the front page of Help Desk and then go to the "PLT
 Miscellaneous Libraries: Reference Manual". The graphics you were
 searching for is all there. There is also a more sophisticated
 interface to the graphics libraries, which is documented in the "PLT
 MrED: Graphical Toolbox Manual".
 
 Hope that helps,
 Robby
