>Description:
If the name of the file for the definitions window is changed
to one with the same graphical size as the existing name,
the name popup in DrScheme's top left area does not get
updated.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Save Definitions -> "try1"
Save Definitions As -> "try2"  ; keep the file dialog
                               ; off the filename popup
; Filename popup isn't updated
