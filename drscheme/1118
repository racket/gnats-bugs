>Description:
In Dr. SCheme v.100, from Help->about Dr. Scheme I tried to click on the highlighted link;
after a while I was waiting, the sistem responded "connection to www.cs.rice.edu, port 80 failed (1:11002 host not found)".
But Rice's site is up and I am connected to it another window. May be the problem comes from the fact that my workstation goes on the internet through a Microsoft proxy server (which is actually configured for every protocol).

>How-To-Repeat:
connect to the internet through a proxy server;
in Dr. SCheme v.100, from Help->about Dr. Scheme click on the highlighted link.

 Sorry, we do not handle proxies in our Web server, so that would
 indeed be the source of the error.  It's only meant to be a
 documentation browser, not a general-purpose Web browser (-:.  The
 simplest thing to do when you encounter a missing documentation bundle 
 in Help Desk is to use your regular browser to download the .plt
 file.  Then go Help Desk's "Open URL", click on "Browse", and choose
 the downloaded .plt file.  Help Desk will install it for you.
