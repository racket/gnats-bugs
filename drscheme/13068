>Description:
This is not a bug report, but a feature request. I apologize for using this application feature to contact you, but I am lazy. 

My request is as the summary states. Currently, I cannot reduce the width of the DrRacket window on my 1280x800 screen beyond a certain point. If I hide the toolbar, I can reduce the window width just fine.

Please provide the option of displaying toolbar icons only. Thank you.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrRacket.
2. Try resizing the window.

Expected: Can reduce window width as desired.

Actual: Cannot reduce window width beyond certain threshold.

 Can you please send a screenshot of your minimum width window? There
 may be something else going on that prevents the minimum width to go
 too low.
 
 Also, another thing to consider is moving the toolbar to the left or
 to the right.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 19 Apr 2013 10:21:39 -0400
Reason>>> DrRacket now provides this option
