>Description:
The GUI debugger can be painfully slow when large variables must be drawn to the register-vars panel. (Example: Imagine an xexpr for a moderately complex web page. Each step in the debugger could take 5-10 seconds, which is a huge pain point.)

Instead, register-vars could use the existing truncate-value function. Here is the old version (5.0.0) up through line 1101:

          (define/public (register-vars frame)
            (send variables-text begin-edit-sequence)
            (send variables-text lock #f)
            (send variables-text delete 0 (send variables-text last-position))
            (for-each
             (lambda (name/value)
               (let ([name (format "~a" (syntax-e (first name/value)))]
                     [value (format " => ~s~n" (second name/value))])

If you change that last line 1101 to this:

                     [value (format " => ~a~n" (truncate-value (second name/value) 256 10))])

Then it would improve.

Granted the limits I chose (length=256 and depth=10) are arbitrary. But so are the truncation limits used elsewhere in the GUI debugger, such as the stack and the status bar. Plus, the user can right-click and print to console the full value.
