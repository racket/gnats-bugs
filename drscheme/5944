>How-To-Repeat:
(define-struct hmm (x y z))

; This works just fine:
(make-hmm 3 4 5)

; This doesn't:
(shared {[a (make-hmm  3 4 5)]}
  a)
; Error message:
;    shared: wrong argument count for structure constructor; expected 1, found 3
; (In general, it claims to expect (floor (/ n 2)) arguments instead of n, at least for (<= 0 n 6).
; For n=0, it works.)

; This error message is interesting:
(shared {[a (make-hmm 5)]}
  a)
; Error message:
; make-hmm: expects 3 arguments, given 1: #<undefined>

 I also notice that this:
 
 (let ()
   (define-struct s (a b c))
   
   (s-a
    (shared ((a (make-s 1 2 3)))
      a)))
 
 returns 3 and it should return 1.
