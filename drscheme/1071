>Description:
Running (raise (make-exn 'oh 'no)) in the repl gives an internal error:
string-append: expects type <string> as 1st argument, given: oh; other arguments were: "
"

It looks like it's still evaluating - only the break button is enabled.
Break doesn't work, but kill sort of does.  Execute no longer refreshes
the repl.

It did the same thing in 100alpha3, only I didn't try hitting break twice.

 Should this be an error that the message field for an exn can only be a string, or should
 anything be allowed there?

 Since programmers can derive new structures from exn, there's no way in
 general to check the types of exn field values at exn-creation time.

 Short of extending mzscheme's built in structures somehow, of course. I
 will just use (format "~a" []) for now.
