>Description:
When you drag the divider bar down to the bottom of the screen (to maximize the top screen area), you can no longer re-size the program window height in XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Drag DrScheme program window to 2nd monitor (bigger than laptop docking station)

2. Manually adjust height of window (larger than height of laptop screen

3. Drag divider bar to bottom of DrScheme program window, to maximize top area

4. Undock and try to use DrScheme on laptop screen: when maximized, the program window is still sized for the larger monitor; if you restore-down to attempt to manually re-size window, you can adjust width but not height...can never see the bottom of the program window.
