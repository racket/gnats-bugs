>Description:
Check syntax does not color all the syntax is should.

>How-To-Repeat:
Check Syntax with this in the definitions window:
(module a mzscheme
  (define (b d)
    (let ((e (d)))
      1))
  (provide)
  )

The second d is not colored correctly.
This program behaves correctly:
(module a mzscheme
  (define (b d)
    (let ((e (d)))
      1))
  )

 Did you claim this already? Offhand, I suspect a MzScheme bug having to
 do with the expansion of `module' and determining whether a
 `#%module-begin' wrapper is explicit or implicit.

 Nah; it was something stupid I did in check syntax. I've already closed the pr.

 Ok, that's good news.
 
 Is the fix exp-tagged? I notice that arrows show up right for `local'
 in Intermediate, but that the binding instance isn't colored blue.
 (Possibly not even related to the PR.)

 yep.

 oops! Right, this is a different bug (actually, none of them were blue
 -- two were green (constants) and one was the base color). Right now,
 things are set up so that the 'bound-in-source annotation overrides the
 usual syntactic category annotation. This is also now (newly) tagged.

 Maybe for 201 we can work on internal keywords, or perhaps think about
 a zodiac-like vocabulary mechanism to handle things like local's
 `define'* keywords and `public' and `private' class keywords in a
 simpler/more-uniform manner?
