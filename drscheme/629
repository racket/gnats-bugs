>Description:
Using wx:yield can confuse DrScheme's "running"/"not running"
indicator and make the break button fail. It appears that
the wrapper for handling evaluations and events is not re-entrant.
>How-To-Repeat:

;The following program works fine:
 (define f (make-object mred:frame% null "Tester"))
 (define p (make-object mred:vertical-panel% f))
 (define b (make-object mred:button% p
		       (lambda (b e)
			 (let loop () (loop)))
		       "Loop Forever"))
 (send f show #t)
;When the "Loop forever" button is hit, DrScheme's "Break"
;button becomes active and it will break the loop.
;Running the following while the frame is open:
; (wx:yield (make-semaphore 0))
;also works, provided that no events occur onthe frame before
;you hit "Break".
;
;However, when an event occurs and completes while the wx:yield
;is still blocking, the Break button ceases to work and the
;indicator goes to "not running".



Alternate way to reproduce the problem: run go fish and
try to break:
  (require-library "gofish.ss" "gofish" "games")
  ; after the game has started, try to break


Another way:

(send (make-object wx:frame% null "Test" 100 100 100 100) show #t)
(wx:yield (make-semaphore 0))
;; resize frame
;; click break

Nothing happens
