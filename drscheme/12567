I open a .sh-file in DrRacket. Edited it and saved it with a .sh-suffix. DrRacket racket saved meta data in this file. I think, metadata should only be saved within .rkt-files.

 I only implement decisions, not make them (wrt to this one).  :)
 
 But seriously, it would be helpful if someone who can account for
 newbies were to think seriously about this change and give an opinion.
 (Someone besides me, assuming you think I meet that criterion.)

 Do you really think this is a newbie problem? 
 
 My conjecture is that Jens had written some student programs and had used *SL. 
 Then he opened a .sh file in another tab and forgot that it was opened in the
 same language. Saving it added the *Sl prefix. Jens isn't a newbie, so this is
 the only explanation I can come up with but he is cc-ed and he can deny or confirm.

 Sorry-- what I think is that any change we make to DrRacket's behavior
 in this arena is likely to affect newbies, so I am very conservative
 about changing it (also because I'm not satisfied with the test suites
 here (because it is hard to test) but that is a fixable problem). Not
 that the specific motivation that led to asking for this change is
 newbie inspired.

 We could say anything that has no suffix (ie, no "." in the filename),
 or a filename that matches this regexp:
 
   #rx"[.]rkt[^.]*$"
 
 (anything that ends with ".rkt" and then possibly more characters (ie,
 ".rktl" etc)). Maybe .ss and .scm, too?
 
 gets the prefix and other files do not get the prefix.
 
 That's less conservative, but also covers things like .txt files that
 someone complained about at some point.
 
 I think it is important to keep the suffix-less files saved with the
 metadata, as I've seen people produce files like that somehow. Nothing
 else really comes to mind about things to be careful about, tho....
 
 What do you guys think?
 
 Should we ask on plt-edu-discuss?

 I have seen kids save files with all kinds of names, including all kinds of suffixes (problem.1, fundies1.hw1, etc) and blank for that matter. 
 
 But yes, I agree that *.txt and *.sh should definitely be covered.

 But now I'm less sure. Isn't the status quo better than when some kid
 who is working on a "shell" assignment or a "text" assignment uses one
 of those two extensions and then his program fails to work when he
 returns to it (perhaps in the moment when he is showing it to his
 friends)?

 Let's suspend the bug report. If this shows up because 'kids' do it, let's revisit.
