>Description:
For Example: (to make editing easier)

- single click down, selects a single character position,
and drag extends it a character at a time.

- double click down, selects single word/symbol/(sexp)
and drag extends it a word/symbol/(sexp) at a time;
where (sexp)'s are selected incrementally within the same
level of hierarchy, and extend selection hierarchically
as enclosing parenthesis are included in selection.
(where (sexp)'s are selected by clicking on one of the parens)

- triple click down, selects a whole (sexp) containing the
selected character position.

 (re: single/double/triple-click & drag)
 
 Everyone uses his own preferred style of interaction with an editor, 
 but here's my 2 cents anyway:  If you want to manipulate s-expressions 
 cleanly, use the text shortcuts; on a mac, option left/right move 
 forward and back an sexp.  Doing it while holding the shift key 
 highlights, and you can cut and paste with the regular keys.  For my 
 money, the keyboard interactions are lots faster and more precise than 
 the mouse ones.
 
 Also, adding the kind of functionality you describe seems 1) hard to 
 describe, and 2) hard to implement.
 
 I would strongly encourage you to check out the keyboard shortcuts I 
 describe.

 I understand that some may prefer selecting text using key-shortcuts;
 however I personally have gotten use to click and dragging, and find it
 much more convenient to select text using a mouse/track-pad, if the editor
 supported at least some basic word by word drag selection, as most text
 editors do; as it helps make the process easier and quicker, because less
 cursor positioning precision is required to select a range of words for
 editing. (the sexp stuff would be nice, but not as significant)
