 This is by design to allow you to insert newlines into an expressions
 before submitting it to the REPL.

 Oh-- I see that I misread your message. Pushing return by itself is
 supposed to work.
 
 Do you have a German keyboard?
 
 Does typing return require you to hold down 'alt' or 'shift' or some
 other modifier key?

 Yes, it is a German keyboard - but return is return, so normally I do 
 not need any other key pressed... and as I wrote, it works with DrScheme 
 v. 4.2.5. My OS is Linux Mint - could the reason perhaps be the 
 different encoding in different OS'(cr/lf)?

 The encoding issues don't seem like they'd be relevant to this symptom.
 
 When you say it works with 4.2.5, were you using the same machine
 (same keyboard, same OS, etc.)?
 
 Also, can you try running this from an command-line:
 
   racket -l tests/gracket/showkey
 
 and then hitting return and sending us the output?
 
 This is what I see when I do that on my mac, just so you get an idea:
 
 1 KEY: "\r" =3D ASCII 13
   rel-code: down
   other-codes: (#f #f #f #f)
   mods:
 2 KEY: release
   rel-code: "\r" =3D ASCII 13
   other-codes: (#f #f #f #f)
   mods:
 
 Also, if that command fails with an error saying that it cannot find
 "tests/gracket" then that means that you've got the standard
 distribution, not the full one, so you should be able take the
 attached file, save it somewhere, and then run "racket showkey.rkt" to
 get the same effect.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 It is the same machine, OS, etc. - I have both versions installed. Whaqt 
 I get with the command line and your program is the following:
 
 1 KEY: "\u0003" = ASCII 3
    rel-code: down
    other-codes: ("\u0003" = ASCII 3 "\u0003" = ASCII 3 "\u0003" = ASCII 
 3 "\u0003" = ASCII 3)
    mods:
 2 KEY: release
    rel-code: "\u0003" = ASCII 3
    other-codes: ("\u0003" = ASCII 3 "\u0003" = ASCII 3 "\u0003" = ASCII 
 3 "\u0003" = ASCII 3)
    mods:
 
 Another thing I noticed is that with verions 5.x there is no 
 highlighting of code between brackets as it is with the earlier versions 
 - perhaps DrRacket just does not realize the end of the expressions?
 
 Again, thanks a lot for your help!

 Thanks.
 
 We've had reports of the highlighting not working from others (but not
 the return key problem). I don't think that we've been able to figure
 out what's wrong yet (or, for that matter, see the problem on our own
 machines as far as I know).
 
 Are you using the 64 bit or the 32 bit version of Racket?
 
 I guess you're using Ubuntu 11.10?

 I'm using Linux Mint 11 (katya), so it's based on Ubuntu 11.04. And I 
 use the 64 bit version - I think I'll try the 32 bit version later today.
 
 Thank you,

 These key events correspond to the "Enter" key on my keyboard (usually
 near the numeric keypad), as opposed to the "Return" key (which is at
 the right end of the keyboard's home row).
 
 So, just to make sure, is this the event you get by hitting the
 "Return" key? Or are you hitting "Enter" key and want it to behave like
 "Return"?
 
 If you're hitting the "Return" key, I wonder whether other programs
 also see an "Enter". Can you try the same experiment with `xev'?
 
 Thanks!

 I could solve the issue:)
 As it turns out via xev, both keys, return and enter, work like enter 
 keys. I then loaded Win7 on my laptop and installed DrRacket 5.2. There, 
 expressions in the interactive window are evaluated by pressing both 
 keys, return /and/ enter. I then installed a windows-like xev and saw, 
 that return works like the enter key - so it is a hardware problem.
 After some googling I got the information, that on Acer laptops, return 
 works as an enter key, even if there is a number board. To get the 
 functionality of return, you have to press Fn + return/enter - and that 
 works perfectly well with DrRacket on Linux Mint:)
 
 Thank you both very much for your help, now I can go on working:)
 Cheers
 Daniel

 FWIW, it's confusing me every time I use it.  I have no problems with
 S-enter inserting a newline, but using return for that is counter
 intuitive.  (Is there any other program that does that?)
 
 (This is especially true in drracket where the functionality of
 inserting a newline is practically never needed, so spending a key
 (without modifiers) on it seems redudnant.)

 Since you can hit just enter when the sexpr is not terminated.  (The
 only difference is that enter also gives you indentation.)
 
 How about flipping the question: what are useful cases for the current
 thing that return does?
 
 (This is regardless of the key -- I'm not arguing for removing this,
 just the need to bind it to return without any modifiers vs leaving it
 for S-enter (and maybe S-return too).)

 You're suggesting that shift-enter and shift-return do what alt-return
 and control-return and enter currently do, and have return and enter
 do what return currently does? What about alt-return and
 control-return?

 I think that there might be some confusion, possibly different
 bindings due to different OSs.  (Also because what I thought that
 S-enter is doing seems wrong -- it works like plain enter for me.)
 
 What I see now is:
 
 1. Enter: enters an expression if sexpr is terminated and cursor at
    its end, newline+indent otherwise.
 
 2. C-enter: always enters what was typed, even if non-terminated or
    not at the end.
 
 3. Return (the key on the numeric keypad): always inserts a newline,
    no indentation.
 
 * S-enter and M-enter (and ESC enter) all work the same as a plain
   enter, AFAICT.
 
 The confusing thing that I referred to earlier is what return is
 doing, since I hit that every once in a while and expect it to be the
 same as enter.  I think that to minimize confusion, they should be
 exactly the same, including modifiers -- so either enter or return
 will do #1, with control they'll both do #2, and with shift they'll
 both do #3.

 I think I understand. (But my keyboard (and the gui libraries) call
 the one on the main keyboard "return" and the one on the numeric
 keypad (or accessible via modifiers on a laptop) "enter".)
 
 One additional wrinkle here is that (what I and the gui library) call
 "enter" is sometimes not accessible unless you are holding down a
 modifier key (e.g., on american mac laptop keyboard).
 
 So, how about this:
 
   return/enter: behavior 1 below
 
   c-return/c-enter: behavior 2 below
 
   s-return/s-enter: behavior 3 below (but with indentation).
 
 In all cases above, optionally allow "alt" (so alt-return is behavior
 1, alt-control-enter is behavior 2, etc) in case we're on a platform
 where "enter" is the same thing as pressing "alt return".
 
 Does that sound right?

 Ugh, I should have checked...  Yes, that's the opposite of the terms
 on my keyboard, and on any PC-like laptop I've used...  In any case,
 if they're both the same, then such confusions will no longer happen.

 Right -- and IMO that's a point in favor of making them be the same.
 (=> no special functionality on the keypad one, which is harder to get
 on laptops.)

 That's what I suggested, no?  (And therefore it's fine with me.)

 To clarify: you mean that the above bindings effectively ignore the
 alt modifier, right?  (I see no use for that, but no harm either.)

 So there are keyboards where you can't do alt-<one-of-them>?  That
 would be a good point in favor of ignoring the alt modifier...
 
 
 > Does that sound right?
 
 Yes, I think that's all fine.
