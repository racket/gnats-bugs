On my computer, it takes 3-4 seconds to color the syntax, during which DrRacket is unresponsive.

Hit Enter, then Ctrl-Up. It again takes 3-4 seconds to color the syntax.

 FWIW, I'm not seeing this on my mac os x machine. I'll try linux next
 (after getting the VM back in shape).

 Yeah, it was on mine too.
 
 Neil: do you know of something specific about yours? (I'm running
 ubuntu 10.10, with whatever the default set of libs you'd get in that
 case.)
 
 It might make sense to profile this, just to see if something jumps
 out at you. You'd do that by setting PLTDRPROFILE, starting up
 DrRacket, and then clicking "start" in the profile window, doing
 whatever (pasting maybe) and then clicking "stop" and sending the
 contents of the window. 50/50 chance we get no interesting
 information, but maybe we will.

 Is it just that you touched a source file and you get interpretation?

 I don't think so, but I'll try the latest release candidate to make 
 sure. This started happening when I pulled so I could check in the first 
 verison of the ray-traced icons. The culprit would have to be a file 
 that hasn't been compiled for a month.
 
 I thought it was just going back in REPL history that was slow at the 
 time, but I discovered yesterday that pasting a medium-size fragment did 
 the same thing. It may not be syntax coloring at all, actually, but 
 something that happens before.

 Ubuntu 11.04 with up-to-date libs.

 I'll give it a shot after I try the release candidate. Thanks.

 Matthias, this is why you make the big bucks.
 
 It wasn't slow on the latest from pre.racket-lang.org, so I deleted all 
 my "compiled" directories and rebuilt. It's fine now. Sorry for the noise.
 
 A question, though: how in the heck does this happen in the first place? 
 Wouldn't the module get recompiled the first time I ran "make" to 
 rebuild the binaries and then ran "raco setup"? I had to do that at 
 least three times.

 Sometimes the make files don't work if you just make and you really
 need to be deleting your build directory and starting over. (That may
 or may not be the issue here tho.)

 You should be able to try it with the release candidate itself.

 This doesn't sound right.  Did Racket change to do a different kind of
 compilation when not creating .zo files?  AFAIK, compilation will get
 you an obvious delay when the code compiles, but there should not be
 any change in the speed of running things.
 
 I tried removing all of the "compiled" directories in my tree, then
 started drracket, then nearly fell asleep in the 8 minutes it took to
 start.  Once it was up, I pasted your text, then used ctrl+up, with no
 problems.  (I tried it just when it started, and after refreshing the
 repl a few times too -- all went at the usual speed.)

 Same here. Interesting.
 
 I once had a weird thing happen, where I edited a collects file with a 
 previous version of DrRacket, then ran it. Thereafter, "raco setup" 
 refused to compile it until I deleted the "compiled" directories.
 
 I'll try to replicate the slowdown that way.
