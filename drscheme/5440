 I'm not sure that XML has a notion that double quote is a special
 character, except perhaps in attributes. As far as attributes go, it's
 not clear that this going to be a problem much of the time.
 
 This XML:
 
    <foo>"</foo>
 
 comes out as:
 
   '(foo () "\"")
 
 which seem to uphold my theory about quote marks.
 
 Paul, is that right?

 Right.  Quotes are only special in atributes.

 The offending problem showed up in an attribute. I fancied that I should
 write <foo value="<goo>">jhgshjge</foo>

 I guess I could search back beyond the < before "goo" following this
 plan:
 
   - if I find a < before I find a >, do not close the tag
   - if I find a > before I find a <, do close the tag.
   - if I find no < or >, close the tag

 I agree! This is why "online" syntax coloring is so hard, too.
