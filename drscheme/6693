>Description:
I am running DrScheme 206 on a WindowsXP (fully updated) 
Pentium4 system.  

When I attempt to print my definitions 
buffer, instead of getting a full page normal size text
print out of the buffer, everything is squeezed into the 
top left hand corner in an approx. 1" by 1" square.  The 
other odd thing is that the page still breaks were 
expected; so if it's a 2 page print out my printer prints 
out 2 pages with text in the top left corner.  The text 
looks to be the correct code from the buffer but is so 
small it is impossible to read.  Changing the font and 
the font size has no affect on the output of the printer.

I would also like to add that I am using a HP 960c 
printer and my printer drivers are completely up to 
date. Also, I do not have problems printing from 
any other programs on my computer.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type code into the buffer.

Attempt to print the file

Check printed output and see it is not as expected.  For
now I will have to copy the buffer and print from another
program.

 This is a known bug.  In the next day or two we will be releasing a
 patched 206 version that solves this bug.
