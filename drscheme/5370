>Description:
The docs for expand program now say this:

The error-termination argument is called when an error occurs. It 
is called on the user's thread. If it is called, the iter argument
is not called again. The user's error-display-handler is set to 
call the error argument.

I would change it to the following, with changes surrounded by []
pairs

The [error] argument is called when an error occurs[, either during
expansion or the evaluation of the iter procedure.] If it is called,
the iter argument is not called again.  [The error argument is set
as the user's error-display-handler.]

Unless, of course, this amended version is not accurate.  The reason
for the the third change is that it wasn't clear that the meaning
of the 'error' argument could be drawn directly from the error-
display-handler.  

Whatever.

 Yes, that's right and after some thought, I'm inclined to get rid of
 the error argument entirely. After all, the error-display handler isn't
 always the right place -- better to let the caller of expand-program
 choose which handler to set (using the `init' argument).
 
 I'll send mail after I make that change.

 Okay, I've committed new files that change the expand-program
 interface. New docs are also committed, but you'll have to just read
 cvs/plt/collects/drscheme/private/tool-info.ss yourself until tomorrow
 when the new docs are built.
 
 The only change is getting rid of the error-termination argument.
