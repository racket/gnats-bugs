>Description:
The Aces solitaire game has a bug.
The instructions say that the object is to remove all cards except the 4 Aces.  However, if you finish the game with the 4 aces on the tops of the piles (with some other cards underneath one or more of the aces), you will still receive the "Congratualtions you win!" message.
>How-To-Repeat:
It's a bit difficult to reproduce, but I've managed to do it twice.  I imagine if you can stack the deck leaving the 4 aces at the end of the deck, you will see the problem.

I think that the code is probably checking the top of the piles to see if the card on the top is an Ace.  You should probably count the cards removed then check to see if there were 48 cards removed.  Alternatively, count the remaining cards to see if there are only 4.

Thanks for the bug report!

Indeed, the winning condition checker wasn't ensuring that there were
no cards below the Aces. I have fixed this and it will be in the next
release.

If you like, the fix is available via our CVS server. See:

for details.
