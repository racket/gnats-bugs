>Description:
Noticed in 4.2.2 and previous installation (4.2.?)

When Dr. Scheme is not apparently running but has been run and closed since the last bootup...

Perhaps 10% of the time I find that I cannot open any Dr. Scheme windows, neither by clicking on my shortcut or by double-clicking on an .ss file.  I proceed to check the the Task Manager.  There is inevitably a DrScheme process running, even though I have no Dr. Scheme windows open.  I may have last used Dr. Scheme minutes or an hour ago.

After manually killing the DrScheme process from within Task Manager, I can now open Dr. Scheme as planned and everything works fine.

This behavior does not necessarily repeat itself.  That is, Dr. Scheme may close fine immediately after witnessing it not close down fine.

I cannot consistently repeat this problem.  I am happy to capture specific log files at your request if that would be helpful.

I am teaching in an introductory high school environment and as such am not doing anything fancy.  I may have as many as 5-8 files open at a time, but usually less.  I am doing a lot of world/universe stuff now.

 Now one of my students has experienced the exact same behavior on his
 personal laptop.  He didn't notice it until the day he updated to 4.2.3.  He
 is running Windows 7.  I am still running XP by the way.
 
  
 
 Basically, his Dr. Scheme shortcuts refused to work.  Dr. Scheme would not
 start up.  Looking in his Task manager revealed a DrScheme.exe running.
 After manually ending that process and waiting a moment, his Dr. Scheme
 shortcut worked fine as did Dr. Scheme.

 Other related behavior.
 
  
 
 One other behavior that seems to have the same cause and has the same fix is
 that my OS will refuse to shutdown without any warnings or popups.  With no
 apparent applications open, in WinXP, I occasionally cannot shutdown my
 computer.  No popups ask me for permission to end a process during this
 behavior.  It just seems like the OS is ignoring repeated attempts to
 shutdown.  I've seen this a few times now, and every time there has been a
 DrScheme.exe process in the Task Manager.  As soon as I end that process,
 the next attempt to shutdown promptly results in a clean shutdown.
 
  
 
 This would only be a serious bug if Dr. Scheme had any substantial
 non-technical user base.
 
  
 
 I have noticed this behavior in 4.2.2 and 4.2.3.

 An update with slightly different behavior:
 
 My student reports that when his computer is in the state of DrScheme having
 been exited but the process is still running...Though his DrScheme shortcut
 won't work, he CAN double-click a .ss file to get DrScheme to open up
 apparently in a fine running state.
 
 I'm thinking the left-open process won't allow the DrScheme shortcut to open
 another instance of DrScheme.  But the left-open process is able to accept
 new file openings directly.
 

State changed from "open" to "feedback" by samth at Sun, 20 Nov 2011 17:46:17 -0500
Reason>>> Given the significant GUI changes in version 5.1, this bug
may no longer exist.  Can you check to see if it still
reappears?
