 Can you be more precise about what version that is? Did you just get a
 fresh checkout? Also, did you open drscheme with a file, or just an
 empty buffer?

 Fresh checkout. Opened with a file. When I looked at the screen, there
 was no coloring. I closed the error box, closed the file, then opened
 it again (without restarting) and it is fine.

 I committed a change yesterday afternoon that I hope fixes this
 problem. If I'm right, then it was actually an old bug, but the editor
 changes made it appear much more often.
 
 Let me know if you see this problem again after updating
 "framework/private/color.ss".
