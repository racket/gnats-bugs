>Description:
When `exit' is called in an event callback (while a REPL expression
is not active), it kinda kills the user's thread, but you don't
get the "the thread is dead" message. You can still try to eval
another expression, but the evaluation never returns (i.e., it
appears that the evaluator is stuck).

>How-To-Repeat:
Run the Go Fish game to its completion, then close the
 window (yes, you want to Exit). There's still a REPL
 prompt. Type a simple expression and it never comes back.

Or, simply evaluate:
 (semaphore-callback (make-semaphore 1) exit)
You get another prompt back, but, as above, it doesn't
work.
