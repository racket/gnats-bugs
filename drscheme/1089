Probably an SICP 1/e user.  Not a bug.  Use `begin' instead.

 DrScheme does not contain a compatibility mode for SICP's first
 edition, so you will notice some differences.  I believe SICP's second 
 edition gets rid of these name differences and brings the book in line 
 with the Scheme standard, but I haven't checked.
 
 Use `begin' instead of `sequence'.

 "sequence" is keyword that has meaning only when declaring
 a class.  Outside of such a declaration, it's an ordinary
 identifier.
 
 Is the expression you provided contained within a class
 declaration?  If not, the behavior you obtained is expected.
