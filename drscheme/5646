>Description:
The top level of programs is being misread by the syntax checker. References to values defined later on in the top level are being syntax checked as defined properly and given an arrow to the lower definition. The given program ofcourse fails to execute as bar is not defined at line 1 but the syntax check does not highlight it in red; it shows it bound to the definition on line 2.

(define foo bar)
(define bar 5)

 Sorry, Mike. This is the correct behavior. The binding arrows only
 indicate what the variable refers to, they do not promise anything
 about what's actually bound to them. Do you recall how to interpret
 letrec from the programming languages course?
 
 Also, think about this program:
 
 (define (odd x) ... (even x) ...)
 (define (even x) ... (odd x) ...)
