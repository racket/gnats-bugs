>Description:
open dr
change the font, close prefs
open another window
use cmd - to switch between windows 
 -- the prefs show up and there is no way to switch 
  among windows with keystrokes (at least i couldn't 
  figure it out)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
the bug: the preferences window wasn't a frame:basic.
the fix: make it one
>Release-Note:
contract: there should, in principle, be a contract that
checks that all frames in the drscheme eventspace are
frame:basic derived.
