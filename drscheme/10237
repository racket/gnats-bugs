Sumamry says it all. This is the bug 
we discussed on plt-dev. I will reply 
with a tar bundle that consists of three
10-line files. That's the best I can do.

(see transcript)
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor a type error. The wrong code was being generated; but not so wrong that it was type incorrect (at the meta level or the object level)

 This is fixed now. It turns out the bug was an old one, not due to the
 changes I made to speed up the test coverage annotations. The test
 coverage annotations just did not annotate the identifiers being
 defined. Usually there is no way that you can put such an identifier
 into a place that would get the test coverage tool to notice its
 existence in a bad way, but apparently you can using teachpacks.
 
 I'm still not completely clear why the coverage tool decided that the
 definition site of the identifier wasn't executed instead of just the
 reference site; that somehow required the fancy phase shifting that
 Matthias's example was doing.
 
 So, I guess ... it is  possible there is another bug somewhere. I don't know.

 How did you fix it? You didn't by any chance change the teachpack?
 
 What this points out is that macros break some 'abstraction  
 barrier' (in quotes because I am not sure it's the right term). Is  
 this due to some effect-ful programming? (not with set! etc but  
 phases seem to have create something like effects)
