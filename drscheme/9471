Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #()))
>Description:
If you encounter an error in the interactions window, and click on the backtrace icon, the backtrace icon refers to lines from the last saved version of the file, not the file as it is currently being displayed in an editor.  This could cause considerable confusion.
>How-To-Repeat:
Module language:
Write(in the definitions window):

#lang scheme
(error "Blah Blah Blah")
Save the file.
Click Run.

Click the backtrace icon in the error that shows up.

That works.

Change definitions window to:
#lang scheme
(error "Blah2 Blah2 Blah2")

Do not save file.
Click Run.

Click on the backtrace icon.
It still shows in the backtrace the first error line.

Save the file.
Click Run.
Click backtrace.
That works.

First ran into this problem on a file that had changed significantly between runs, and was very confused by the outdated backtrace.
>Fix:
Wit the change of using paths as source locations (instead of editors), drscheme has to be more careful about where it gets the source text from and this is one place where it was just loading it off of the disk regardless.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation and it would not have been a type error, either.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 09 Jun 2008 18:45:56 -0400
Reason>>> This is fixed in SVN.

Thanks.

 I just fixed this bug and it seems like an innocuous enough fix to
 still be included in the release, but if you think it unwise, that's
 fine too.

 Well, the PR was submitted at 1pm. I was on the road at that time...
 we pulled up to the house at about 5:30 after an all drive and its
 fixed at 6pm.
 
 What more do you want, man!
