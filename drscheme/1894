>Description:
I'm not able to create a canvas; it dysplays an error; I'm not sure why this is happening maybe is because there is something wrong with my machine. Nevertheless, I downloaded the supposed documentation that it needed and it still didn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
First of all, try to create a canvas; (start 640 480)
When I execute the command, it gives this messageWelcome to DrScheme, version 103.
Language: Beginning Student Custom.
reference to undefined identifier: start

now click on the start link. It will take to this page that tells you this:

DOCUMENTATION MISSING

You tried to access documentation for mred.

The documentation is not installed on this machine, probably because it is not part of the standard DrScheme distribution.

To Read the Documentation Online

* http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/103/doc/mred/node260.htm

To Download and Install the Documentation

* http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/103/DocBundles/mred-doc.plt

Follow the above link within Help Desk to download the documentation. Help Desk will install it automatically. After installing, continue to the newly-installed documentation.

If you use a proxy server, this download will not work. Instead, use some other proxy-based mechanism to download the .plt file from this url:

http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/103/DocBundles/mred-doc.plt

and then use the Open URL menu item from the File menu to open that .plt from your local computer. (Alternatively, you can drag the .plt file onto Setup PLT, or start up Setup PLT with the .plt file from the command line, depending on your platform).

 One thing to fix for this is to add the teachpack primitives to the 
 searchable index, somehow.
 
 Who is responsible for that?
