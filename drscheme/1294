>Description:
If PLTCOLLECTS contains a non-existent path, then you
can't start DrScheme.

Either the restriction should be defined and DrScheme should
report a clear error messages, or (my preference) non-existent
paths should be allowed in PLTCOLLECTS.

>How-To-Repeat:
Setenv PLTCOLLECTS to contain a non-existent path
Start DrScheme

 I have fixed it but not released the change. Unless you would like me
 to hurry things up, I do not plan to release in the next few weeks. The
 change is in the all-collections function at the top of
 collects/drscheme/tools/project-manager/main.ss.
