Hi 
I downloaded Rice Scheme to my E drive, not sure if this is problem or not,

but when i tried the basic example for graphics (open-graphics), etc.
it complained about the 2nd line - (define w (open-viewport practice 300
300))
and it didnt like the word practice ,a nd on the first line it didnt
open any viewport!
So i am not sure that i have it configured properly or what?
i tried running the basic example with Drscheme.
also another perhaps related problem is that the Rice scheme executor MZRice
doesnt start
because it doesnt "know" about MzScheme - it complains about this.

Do I need to load some library or what to get it started!?

thx, ken schatten

schatten@erols.com or kschatten@nsf.gov




>How-To-Repeat:
(open-graphics)
(define w (open-viewport practice 300 300))
it didnt open any graphics window - also my rice scheme executor MZRice
doesnt start
because it doesnt "know" about MzScheme - it complains about this.

 First of all, please do not send bug reports to me AND to the Web
 interface.  This just creates extra busy-work.

 Scheme is not like BASIC: it is not a line-oriented language.  Rather, 
 it is expression-oriented.  So it is meaningful to talk about the
 "first expression", "second expression", etc, but not about the
 corresponding lines.
 
 If you don't show me (via cut-and-paste) the complete code you tried,
 I obviously can't tell what you (or DrScheme) did wrong.  You also
 didn't tell me what the actual error message is -- just that "it
 complained" -- so I can't tell which of many possible errors you
 encountered.  In short, what follows is surmise.
 
 There's a pretty good chance that whatever you tried did not bind the
 variable `practice' to anything.  Thus, when you type
 
   (open-viewport practice 300 300)
 
 Scheme tries to evaluate the variable `practice', does not find it
 bound to anything, and gives you an error.  I assume that is the error
 it gave, which you report as "it didn't like the word practice".
 
 If you have an error, the statement cannot execute.  So I don't
 understand why you're surprised that it failed to open a viewport.
 
 > So i am not sure that i have it configured properly or what?
 
 I can't tell until I know better what you did.

 This is an unrelated problem.  DrScheme and MzRice are unrelated
 packages.  Do you actually need MzRice?  If not, I would not bother
 with it, and would stick to DrScheme instead.  If you want it for some
 reason, please tell me the exact error you got.
 
 Thanks.

 Ah, I assume this is the entire program you ran?  If so, then clearly
 it is erroneous, since `practice' is not bound anywhere.  I just
 checked, and this is indeed what the documentation suggests.  The docs 
 are in error; I will have them corrected for the next release.
 
 In the meanwhile, the fact that you didn't understand the error
 suggests that you don't really understand Scheme's model of
 evaluation.  For that reason, I suggest you start at a more
 introductory level than with graphics.  You should soon be able to
 work your way up to graphics and beyond.
