>Description:
The module browser has a bug where it gives a path to
string-append; I got this error:

;; --
Error expanding the program:

string-append: expects type <string> as 1st argument, given: #<path:C:\Documents and Settings\dherman\My Documents\Papers\Extensible Syntax\Experiments\parser-generators\ll1>; other arguments were: ".ss"
;; --
>How-To-Repeat:
I had a file opened and I had checked syntax (don't know
whether that affects things at all). I selected View | Show
Module Browser and got the above error.

 I've fixed several bugs relating to the module browser, but there still
 may be more. Please try your program again and, if it still fails,
 please send it to me.
 
 Thanks,

 Will do, as soon as the next point release comes out (I don't have the 
 facility to do a build, sorry).

 The nightly builds are independent of the point releases. I believe
 that the current nightly build has the fix.

 Duh, of course. My bad.
 
 I don't think it's made it in there yet, though. I just downloaded the 
 nightly build and still got the same error. If I see Eli today I'll ask 
 him when a new binary will be ready.

 Okay. But maybe I didn't fix your bug. My test program was:
 
   (module m mzscheme
     (require-for-template (lib "cml.ss"))
     (require (lib "mred.ss" "mred")))
 
 which should be working now.

 You're right -- there was a network problem that made it fail.  I've
 just finished a new build now.
