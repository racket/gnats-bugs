the paren matcher raises an error:

   paren-match: internal-error: open parenthesis ; is not in the list 
   (() . () (] . [) (} . {))

(probably those error should use "~s" or "~e" to show values

>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce: put this in a window in scheme mode:
 
    ";" "a"
 
and type a control-meta-b when the cursor is between the last " and the a.

 I took a quick look and this turns out to be eay to fix: within the
 matcher, matching an eol-comment in a backwards search should be
 treated the same as matching a non-special character.
 
 I fixed and released paren.ss.
