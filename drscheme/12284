>Description:
I have been working with drracket in class without having problems up to version 5.0.2. 
After the GUI change coming along version 5.1.x text within parentheses isn't highlighted anymore making working with drracket really unpleasent. Changing the programs properties while using the new unity-desktop is also impossible.
thanks a lot 
>How-To-Repeat:
try working with drracket on Ubuntu 11.10
