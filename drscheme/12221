 Sorry-- what is "clear current"?

 I gave a crisp sequence of steps in "How to repeat".  I just re-ran
 those steps.  At the very step where I said
 
   Select the "Clear Current" option.
 
 I get a pop-up that has a "Clear Current" option.
 
 I cannot tell you why your grep doesn't work, but if you tried the
 steps I gave and they didn't reproduce, please let me know.
 
 If I didn't give such steps you'd be justified in being snarky.

 When I do the "File|New" steps in your sequence of steps I get a new
 DrRacket window. No "clear current" button. (My snarkyness was from my
 perception of yours. I guess you weren't intentionally being snarky,
 but you sure weren't helpful.)

 My File | New... pops up a modal window: "Would you like to create a
 new window, or clear out the current one?"  There are two buttons:
 
 - Clear Current
 - New Window
 
 I suppose it's possible that a long time ago I set a preference
 somewhere in DrRacket that asks me to prompt for this rather than
 automatically opening a new window.  If you want I can go search, but
 if such a preference sounds familiar, then you probably recognize the
 one I'm talking about.  (Let me know if you want me to go hunting.)

 PS: my initial reaction here is "get rid of that feature" not "fix it".
 
 Is there some reason to keep that thing? IIRC, it is a simple thing I
 added from the days before I implemented tabs properly to kind of tide
 over towards that. (Maybe.) So you could just do control-t (control-=
 in 5.1.3) instead of that?

 Just catching up with mail...
 
 I suspect the "feature" pre-dates when you added File | Open Here....
 Now that the user has the ability to do "tab management" with Open
 Here, there's no need for File | New to effectively ask, "Did you mean
 here?"  If they did, they wouldn't have used New...
 
 So I'd be happy to see it go away entirely.  Less code => better.

 I think "file|open here" is part of the same thing (juding from the
 code). I'm going to get rid of all of it. If there's something you
 like about it, lets see if we can find a different way to do that.

 I'm happy to see a comprehensive revision of the File menu.  Firefox has
 
 _N_ew Window
 New _T_ab
 Open _L_ocation
 _O_pen File...
 Close Win_d_ow
 _C_lose Tab
 
 The separates window/tab management from current buffer content management.
 
 Would you consider the same?  (I guess you'd merge the two Open's, but
 they'd be understood to be in the current tab, which if in a saved
 state just gets replaced but if not, you first get the choice of
 saving it and then proceeding.  One thing I noticed is that in the
 current modals, Esc doesn't work.  In this scheme, I'd want to be able
 to say "File | Open", get the popup saying "Your current buffer is
 unsaved", and think, "Oh, hey, let me leave this alone and go to a new
 tab" and hit Esc to indicate "stop all this".)

 If I'm understanding you correctly, then no-- I think that web
 browsers are the exception here because they don't generally open
 documents on your computer whereas most other apps (word, emacs,
 imovie, photoshop, etc etc etc) are opening documents from your
 machine and editing them and work in the way drracket works.

 I guess I don't understand why Open File doesn't do what you claim
 DrRacket needs to do.  Browsers open local files, too.  It's not the
 common case, but it happens and that's why Open File is on the menu.

 Well, a response like this is why I qualified my earlier message with
 "if I understand you". Apparently I didn't. Do you mind trying again?
 I've read your message multiple times now and it doesn't make a lot of

 I'm suggesting that the menu options in Firefox are a good guide for
 the ones to have here.  The only one that's out of place is Open
 Location.  The rest seem to be a good (I would not go so far as to say
 "the right") set of menu options.  I'm asking whether these are the
 ones you're considering having, or something else, in your redesign.
