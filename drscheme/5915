>Description:
provide/contract cannot handle structures with coinciding
field names.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module x mzscheme
  (require (lib "contracts.ss"))
  
  (provide/contract (struct a ((b any?)))
                    (struct x ((b any?))))
  
  (define-struct a (b))
  (define-struct x (b)))

Evaluating gives this error:

module: duplicate definition for identifier in: |provide/contract-field-contract-b-ACK-DONT_USE_ME|
>Fix:
the problem was that the names I was generating weren't
different.
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation.
