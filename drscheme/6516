>Description:
The arrow drawing code assumes that the editor<%>'s in any Dr.
Scheme box are text%'s. This causes interface breakage. I have
tried to gaurd against this by implementing an adapter but it
would break my existing interface.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a new drscheme window
Addline (require (lib "test-case.ss" "test-suite" "private"))
Insert a test case box
Check syntax
mouse over the test case box (which contains pasteboards).
>Fix:
there were two bugs here.

the first bug: a simple fix -- the contract violation pinpointed
the problem.

the second bug: I was using a pair of variables to ensure that extra drawing 
didn't happen. Each iteraction, I would compare new computations of
the values of those variables to their current variables. If they were the
same, nothing gets drawn.

Sadly, the check for the new values of the variables was happening at
the wrong time. there was no contract violation, just wrong drawing
(actually updating at wrong times).

This one was painful to track down...
