>Description:
The options in the 'Choose Language' dialog box are all over the place.  Not only do the option buttons continually move about, but sometime more than one becomes selected!

Also, try as I might, I can't get functions displayed in Constructor format - I think this is probably tied in with the dodgy option screen.
>How-To-Repeat:
just go to 'Choose Language', 'Show Options' and see for yourself.
