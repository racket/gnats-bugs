>Description:
When there's only one file open, DrScheme seems to ignore
the setting to open files in tabs instead of windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Set the preference to open files in separate tabs.
2. Exit DrScheme.
3. Start up DrScheme by double-clicking a Scheme file.
4. Open another file via File | Open or the drop-down in the definitions window.

The new file opens in a new window, not a tab.

 If you start drscheme from the commandline, do you see this behavior
 too (ie, in step 3, start up drscheme with "/path/to/plt/bin/drscheme
 file.ss" isntead of clicking on file.ss)?
 
 Also, can you double check that the check box is still checked in the
 preference dialog when drscheme fails to open the file properly?
 
 Thanks,

 Also, if you can, please get the latest version. I can't recall if I've
 done something relevant since the 26th, but I think I did something not
 too long ago (I'm not super optimistic about this, tho).

 Yes, it is still checked.

 I just downloaded the version build on the 29th (the most recent one 
 available for Windows), and I can't seem to reproduce the bug anymore. 
 I'll let you know if it happens again.

 Great. Please re-open the PR, if it does. I do remember fixing
 something along these lines, so maybe that was it.

 I'm not sure how to reopen a PR, but I think I can reproduce the 
 behavior in a different context now: it seems if there's a help desk 
 open, opening a file opens it in a new window, not a tab. This happens 
 no matter how I open the file (File | Open, double-clicking, dragging on 
 top of DrScheme).
 
 (I'm using the nightly binary version 299.102-cvs11apr2005 in Windows XP.)

 Okay, I'll look into it.
 
 To re-open PRs, go to internal.plt-scheme.org, follow the link for the
 bug report system, put in the PR number, edit it and change it from
 closed to open (and put a reason in).
 
 I've re-opened this one.
