>Description:
Canceling "Keybinding from PLaneT" dialog with empty PLaneT spec causes error.
>How-To-Repeat:
(1) Select menu [Edit]-[Keybindings]-[Add User-defined Keybindings from PLaneT].
(2) Push [Cancel] button.
(3) Internal error occurs.
>Fix:
there was a `when' that was mis parenthesized (yikes!)
>Release-Note:
this was a contract violation and it pinpointed the bug.
this would not have been a type error (at least not obviously so).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 14 Oct 2006 13:07:36 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.
