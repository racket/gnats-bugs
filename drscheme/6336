>Description:
Some errors lead to almost empty stack traces.  These still
produce arrows, which look rather confusing and ugly
overlaid on the code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write the program

  (f 'x)

where F is undefined.  Execute.  You get an arrow from
the middle of F to the ( just before it.  This comes out
looking like a weird spce-invadersy blob atop the code.

 What do you suggest it look like? (FWIW, It is reflecting the stack...)

 I don't know that I have any particularly ingenious ideas.  At the
 very least it should look less like a blot on the landscape.  Perhaps
 a self-loop, where the loop actually stands out?  But that would be
 hard because DrScheme's arrows are only linear.

 I can do any kind of shape I want, of course. The head and tail aren't
 actually in the same place; the stack contains the application and then
 the variable look up.
