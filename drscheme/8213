>Description:
The result of evaluating the following expression:

    (read-syntax #f (open-input-string "#(foo)"))

can not be printed:


> (printf "~a" (read-syntax #f (open-input-string "#(foo)")))
write-special: port does not support special values: #<output-port>


and the syntax snip from DrScheme doesn't recursively dive into vector syntaxes.  It prints:

  #1(#<syntax::3>)

and should rather be:

  #1(foo)
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
the first bug was a missing check ing interactive-value-port to make sure that the port was actually one that could accept specials.

the second bug was just me not recurring thru vectors, so it has been added.
>Release-Note:
The first bug was a contract violation, in the right place.

the second bug has no contract violation.
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Tue, 08 Aug 2006 19:00:31 -0400
Reason>>> Looks like it's working fine outside of DrScheme


State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 08 Aug 2006 23:43:35 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the report!
