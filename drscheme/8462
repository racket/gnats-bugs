 I'm not sure what would be better. Altho it seems slow, it also seems
 wrong to skip some lines.

 But it's just like any graphical window -- I don't expect it to scroll
 by single pixels just like I don't expect Gimp window to scoll by
 single pixels.

 Matthew: I'm not seeing a method that will let me scroll an
 editor-canvas by multiple lines. Is there such a thing?

 I've just aded Eli and bugs back on to the cc list, to prove this
 isn't my bug anymore :)

 I'm sorry if I'm too thick here, but wouldn't it be possible using
 manual scrollbars?

 I suppose ... but that seems like hard work.
 
 Am I wrong about that?

 Feel free to pass the bug to me if you don't want to, or if it's not
 quick.  I don't think it's a high priority -- but I would like to
 eventually get to it.

 I have used the Contour window for a week now, and I second any and  
 every effort to speed up how it functions, with some loss of accuracy.

 FWIW, that's not the slowness I meant. I was referring to the speed
 with which it moves when you click the scroll bar's arrows.
