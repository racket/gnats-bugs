>Description:
In the DrS About box, there's a pointer to the 
COPYING-LIB file in the local filesystem.  With the 
About box at normal size, the path gets broken
over two lines, which looks kind of naff.

I think it would be better to have a link to the
servlet /servlets/release/license.ss, which contains
somewhat more info than the GNU file, and also has 
a link to the GNU file.

 Can you add this link, like you've done with other links, to the help
 desk's external interface?
 
 thanks,
 Robby

 Sorry, I'm a bit confused.
 
 Can't a function be added to plt/collects/drscheme/private/help-desk.ss,
 similar to "goto-tour", that refers to the servlet?
 
 Or maybe that's exactly what you mean?

 A while back, I had asked you for a way to go to a page that would work
 better than what I'm forced to use. I wanted an interface that would
 tkae, for example, a manual name and and an index/keyword entry in the
 manual and go to that place. You did that part, I think. I also wanted
 something that would go to particular places, such as the release notes
 and the tour. That hasn't materialized yet, so I just had those stubs
 in there. I guess the communication got lost somehow.
 
 In any case, I would like to see that the help desk library exports
 procedures like goto-tour and goto-release-notes that do the right
 thing with frames, etc. also, that means that if the locations of these
 things change, Drscheme doesn't need to change, only the help desk
 needs to change.
 
 Does that sound okay?

 Sorry, I missed that bit entirely.

 How about something like
 
   (goto-hd-location sym)
 
 where sym is in '(hd-tour release-notes license)?  We can extend the
 list of choices without changing exports, if needed.

 That's fine with me, but exports are checked statically and function
 argument aren't. That's why I liked the other.
