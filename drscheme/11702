 Eric do you remember what this bug was about? I can't tell from the
 description and the dropbox url has expired.
 
 This issue is most likely fixed so if I don't hear anything soon I'll
 just close it.

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by rafkind at Sat, 02 Jul 2011 12:26:53 -0400
Reason>>> user reports the bug is fixed
