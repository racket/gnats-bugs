>Description:
Sometimes when I'm editing code in DrScheme, I see a problem to fix or an enhancement to make in another module (let's say 'scheme/private/foo'). So I make it and rerun my program to see if it works as expected. And there's no change. So I try a variation on my original change. Still nothing. I add a call to 'error' at the top of the module. No error! The world has gone insane!

And then finally I remember, that module is required by X, which I think might be used by Y, which is probably attached to the user namespace from DrScheme's namespace. So my changes have no effect whatsoever, because the file never gets consulted after DrScheme loads.

*facepalm*
*restart DrScheme*

Would it be feasible for DrScheme to detect this situation and display a notice, something along the lines of:

"Warning: Changes to module 'scheme/private/foo' are being IGNORED because the module is shared between DrScheme and user programs."

That would help me get to the "restart DrScheme" step earlier.

 I'd welcome a patch for that one (probably best to make it only work
 in the module language) but I've been happily using two drschemes for
 quite some time. I recommend that, esp now that most computers have
 two processors so you can run the setup-plt's in parallel (skip the
 docs on one of them).

 So far I have not found a permutation of this (building two copies of
 DrScheme) that works if you are using planet packages -- both
 DrSchemes want to use the same code for the packages, but each wants
 to "own" them.  I don't know if that's an issue for Ryan, but it
 certainly is for me.

 Does it work to set the PLTPLANETDIR for one of them?

 Good question.  I only recently found out about that option.  Not sure
 if it existed last time I checked.  Anyway, I will have to try it
 soon.
