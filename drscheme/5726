>Description:
when i try to create .exe followin error ocurs :

display: expects type <output-port> as 2nd argument, given: #\\; other arguments were: #\\


>How-To-Repeat:
I am afraid that i had deleted "c:\temp\drs-standalone-exectable-init1028896893252226394" 
because i managed to create .exe file and it used to work 
till i deleted files from c:\temp directory 
now when i try to start this .exe the error is 

default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "c:\temp\drs-standalone-exectable-init1028896893252226394" (Das System kann die angegebene Datei nicht finden.; errno=2)

[Exited]

thanks 


>Fix:
the bug: I thought that modules embedded via `(file ,filename) type module specs would also be available to require via those paths. In reality, the module is embedded, but attached to the namespace only via the usual symbol path (ie, if you embed (file "/home/robby/tmp.ss") you can use (require 'tmp) but nothing else to get the file).

Also, i hadn't deleted the tmp files (accidentally left out the delete from when I was debugging them and looking at their contents).

>Release-Note:
There should be a contract that says that when a file is embedded with a particular spec, it can be extracted with that spec. Of course, the implementation of module embedding doesn't live up to that spec, for the moment.
