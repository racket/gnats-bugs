>Description:
The little pull-down "(define ...)" menu doesn't list
any of the names defined below a commented-out definition.

>How-To-Repeat:
Put

(define x 1)
(define y 1)
(define z 1)

in a definition window.  Look at the content of the menu.
Everything is fine.

Now comment out the definition of y.  Look at the content
of the menu: z is not listed.
