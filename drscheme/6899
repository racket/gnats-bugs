>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
1. set resolution to something big
2. start up DrScheme
3. make window pretty big (with bottom right corner draggy)
4. change resolution to something relatively small
   (smaller than current size of window)
5. click maximize (green) button.

At this point, I'd expect DrScheme's window to get smaller
to match the small resolution, but it doesn't -- it
seems to get bigger than it was (but it's hard to tell)
>Fix:
The maximize button now makes the window the full size of the screen.
>Release-Note:
Not sure what happened here, but it doesn't sound like a type error, nor a contract error.

 Possibly related to this -- you save the locations of some windows,
 wouldn't it make sense to ignore them when the saved ones are bigger
 than the current resolution?
 
 (I had a student complains about this when running DrScheme in a vnc
 window that was smaller than his usual screen.)

 Hey PR: I think the maximize button is suposed to just maximize (and
 if the window is maximized, shrink it back to the state is was
 before), so maximizing and then resizing counts as moving you out of
 the maximized state.
 
 This does seem to be the windows interpretation, instead of the mac
 one of the maximize button, so if you have a better proposal, I'm all
 ears.
 
 Just in case you've forgotten, here's the PR I'm talking about (wow,
 only took me 4 years to go to it!)

 Okay, thanks.
