 What happens when you hit delete? Or click before the close paren and
 type an open paren?

 It works fine when I delete it, apparently it was my mistake.
 
 In MzScheme I got an immediate error msg, then thought that there
 is a bug when I see that DrScheme interaction window hangs instead
 of producing that error. Clearly it didn't *hang*, but waiting as usual.
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.
