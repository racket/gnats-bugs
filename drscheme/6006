>Description:
If a file contains a (semicolon-)commented out define, no
later defines appear in the popup list.  

Has this bug already been submitted
>How-To-Repeat:
enter the following program:

(define a 3)
; (define b 3)
(define c 3)

open the defines popup.  See only 'a'
>Fix:
once a semicolon comment was encountered, the
loop looking for more definitions wasn't called.
>Release-Note:
not clear that this woul dhave violated any contract.
