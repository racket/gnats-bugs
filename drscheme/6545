The operation of Check Syntax in the Expander language can be surprising;

 Sorry, you're saying that the current behavior seems reasonable to you, 
 right?
 
 I still don't see anything besides a sea of green.  That is:
 
 a)  enter
 (define-syntax (foo stx)
    #`(+ 3 4 5))
 
 (foo 4)
 
 b) set language level to Expander
 
 c) click on Check Syntax
 
 All green, no arrows anywhere...
 
 Am I missing something?

 Well, I was thinking of something more like this:
 
 (define-syntax (s stx)
   (define (f x)
     (+ x 1)))
 
 (s 1)
 
 and then hopefully the f and x and stuff would work as expected.
 
 I'll look into it at somep point (hopefully)

 This code caused an error (no expression after internal defines).... I 
 was unable to figure out exactly what you meant.
 
 I figured you were trying to generate some work at expansion-time, so I 
 tried this (with no luck):
 
 (define-syntax (s stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ x) (let* ([silly 3]
                    [billy (+ silly 4)])
               #`(+ x 3))]))
 
 (s 1)
 
 I still don't see why Check Syntax would be useful in the Expander 
 language.
 
 Ehh, whatever.

 yes, that's what I meant.

 It would show you the binding structure of the code in the macro, no
 (ie, silly and billy)?

 Nope, I see no arrows anywhere.  That is, I mouse all over, and can't 
 get any arrows to show up at all.  It's all green, as well.
