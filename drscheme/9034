>Description:
The memory size number at the lower-left of the DrScheme window, just left of the flashing GC icon, does not update after a program finishes running, even if the program allocated a large amount of data.  After running a program, it may still report a number comparable to the startup size; if I open a new window or click the GC button, it then updates to a very large number (and, if I clicked GC, drops to a smaller one when the GC finishes).
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this code multiple times; after each, see the effects on the reported memory size when opening a new window or clicking the GC button.

(require (lib "etc.ss"))
(define (sexp-size s)
  (if (pair? s)
      (+ 1 (sexp-size (car s)) (sexp-size (cdr s)))
      1))
(define x (build-list 200 (lambda (j) (build-list 200 (lambda (i) (build-list i identity))))))
(sexp-size x)

Reason>>> The memory use is an SVN-only feature that does what it
does. The only time it is updated is when you click on the
button,
or when you make a new window (the latter because it just
makes it easy to keep them all in sync).

If you want to do something better, probably best for you to
figure out what you want and add it yourself.

 Thanks for the clarification, that's good to know.
