>Description:
I entered an expression in the definitions area containing a lambda character then attempted to search for it via the find facility and it reported zero matches.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. enter an expression in the definitions area using a lambda character (inserted via command+\)
2. commmand+f to open the find panel
3. command+\ to insert a lambda character into the find field
4. observe that the character was not found / highlighted

 This seems to work for me.

 Perhaps there are some steps missing?

 Right you are!
 
 I think what happened was that focus was in the interactions area when  
 I performed the find operation... it wasn't immediately clear to me  
 which pane had focus / was the target buffer for the find operation.
 
 Sorry for the noise.
