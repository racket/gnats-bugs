>Description:
The `Loading ...' information at the bottom of the splash screen is
certainly handy for programmers who write MrEd applications (four
people, at most), but it is ugly for most DrScheme users. For these
users, the information is pure clutter because 1) they don't know what
it means, and 2) if they can figure out what it means (e.g., they
notice that "edit.ss" takes a while to load), they can't do anything
about it (i.e., they can't get rid of "edit.ss" to speed things
up). When the information is not useful, the startup screen looks much
nicer with just an image and a gauge.

Could we have a low-level option, set via .mred.resources, to make the
text lines visible (with the default that all of the lines are
invisible)?
