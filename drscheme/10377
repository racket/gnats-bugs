>Description:
Enter the following code, hit run, see the error.
Now modify the code in any way, and click the single-stopsign icon, it will
highlight the same position+span which are now just a random place in the
new code.  It should at least pop up a question describing what could be
wrong and asking if you're sure about it.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(define (blah) (car 'blah))
(blah)
>Fix:
added 'edition' to text:basic<%> and then kept track of them in drscheme
>Release-Note:
This was really more of a feature request than a bug so unsurprisingly this would not have been a type error nor was it a contract error.

 Matthew: why does get-revision-number return an inexact number instead
 of an integer?
 
 I'm considering how to keep track of edits to an editor (as required
 by this PR, link below) and I could either emulate get-revision-number
 (but only count inserts and deletes) or I could some kind of an
 interface where you supply a thunk and that thunk is invoked when the
 editor changes. I prefer the former, since adding more callbacks seems
 just like asking for trouble (and I don't actually need to be called
 back for the PR).

 Well, I've fixed this bug, using a get-edition-number that only tracks
 insertions and deletions. I'm using an integer (which hopefully
 remains a fixnum :).
