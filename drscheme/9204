>Description:
When syntax-check is working, the output port is drscheme's
output-port, which I'm sure can lead to all kinds of security
problem (security in breaking drscheme, that is).

Anyway, at least the output should be captured and displayed
somehow (or discarded) since typed-scheme prints a message
when it's done type-checking.  (Which is a good thing.)

I think that Sam should change it to show that message only
when working interactively (ie: only when clicking run), but even with that the uncaptured output is a problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter this in the module language and click check-syntax:

#lang scheme
(define-syntax (foo stx)
  (printf "blah\nblah\nblah\n")
  #'1)
(foo)
