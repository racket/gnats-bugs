Linux
>Description:
Hiliting updates ok, but when a hilite is removed, the screen is
not refreshed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Eval (cons)
 [The expression is painted pink]
Iconize & deiconize
 [Still pink - good]
Type the letter x, just so the buffer is modified
 [Still pink - BAD, because internally it's no longer pink]
Iconize & deiconize
 [Now we see that it's no longer pink]

Instead of iconizing & deiconizing, you can cover half of
 the pink and uncover it, then `(cons)' is only half-pink,
 which is clearly wrong.
