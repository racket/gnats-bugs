>Description:
In the description of how to write teachpacks in DrScheme, the "lazycons.scm" example given has a bug.  The link is:

http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/drscheme/drscheme-Z-H-4.html

I've included a fix below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Saving the "lazycons.scm" file to disk and then loading it as a teachpack generates an error:

The teachpack file /home/mvanier/tmp/lazycons.scm did not load properly.
module: duplicate definition for identifier

The duplicate identifier is "lcons" which is defined both as a struct and as a macro.  Changing the struct's name to "lazy-cons" and modifying the rest of the code accordingly fixes the bug.

State-Changed-Why:
    Thanks for the report, I've fixed the docs for the next
    release.
    
    Incidentally, it is probably better to change the definition
    of the lcons macro and then do a rename in the provide
    statement -- that way the results of lconsing something 
    print as struct:lcons in the repl window.
