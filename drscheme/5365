>Description:
Check-syntax doesn't handle local requires properly.  I get an
internal error with the following text (for example):

default-load-handler: cannot open input file: 
"/Users/clements/marks.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

This is for a file in plt/stepper/private (not in ~clements/, 
in other words.

After this error occurs, the definitions buffer is marked as 
read/write, but I cannot edit it.  I cannot even set the focus
by clicking in it.

>How-To-Repeat:
perform the following steps in a fresh directory (so it doesn't 
match the default load path, whatever that is)

create the following files:
foo.ss:
(module foo mzscheme
  (require "bar.ss"))

bar.ss:
(module bar mzscheme
  )

Now open foo.ss, and click check syntax

 Just to be sure, do you have revision 1.42 of
 plt/collects/drscheme/syncheck.ss?

 Okay, I've now checked this bug under X, using the same collects 
 tree.  Problem is still there.

 Which parts of the problem? (the error, the locking, *and* the funny
 focus behavior or just the error?)
 
 This doesn't reproduce for me, so I'm kind of stuck. Can you explain
 precisely the layout of the directories and files that use to
 demonstrate the problem? Also include what directory you start DrScheme
 from.
 
 Here's one that works for me, can you also try this one?
 
   in ~robby:
    tmp.ss:  (module tmp mzscheme (require "tmp2.ss"))
    tmp2.ss: (module tmp2 mzscheme)
 
   start drscheme from / (the filesystem root) and open tmp.ss. 
   check syntax.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 yep, I still see the problem.  It's looking for tmp2.ss in the / directory:
 
 [osterley:/] clements% default-load-handler: cannot open input file: 
 "/tmp2.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
 
 I just did a cvs update of the X sources, to see if I'd missed 
 something, but I got no changes.  Now I'm doing a clean build. Ugh.
 
 When are you next going to be here?  If you'd like, I'd be glad to 
 forget about it for a while.  Or are you ever coming back?

 Huh? you see output in the shell? Wierd.

 It's not that, I don't think. I'm really quite surprised that your
 scheme files are up to date. Are you sure you've got the right tree and
 all that? 
 
 This is an old bug, and it is fixed in the currently released sources,
 AFAIK.

 I'm coming back on the 12th (13th is Monday).
 
 See you then!

    rbf - cannot reproduce (either part). John says that
    it doesn't work for him with /proj/scheme/plt on denali
    so will try it there.

    The only contract I can imagine that would have
    helped is a contract that states what parameters
    are checked (in a dynamic sense) during the
    dynamic extent of a particular built in mz
    procedure. I think that this is good docs, but
    it's not clear the effort pays off for contracts???
