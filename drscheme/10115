>Description:
Redex, in private/dot.ss, has a short hard-coded list of directories to search for the "dot" and "neato" executables.  However, this does not help if they are present in a less conventional location (e.g., /home/jld/opt/Linux-i686/bin) which is nonetheless mentioned in $PATH.

I've prepared a patch to replace the hard-coded list with the contents of $PATH, at:
  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~jld/misc/redex-graphviz-path.diff

It would of course be easy enough to augment that list, if the current state is due to some environment where that is necessary.
>How-To-Repeat:

This was not a contract error, nor was it a type error.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 05 Mar 2009 08:30:38 -0500
Reason>>> I've fixed this in SVN. I used find-executable-path instead
of searching the path, tho (I've kept the hardwired paths in
there, so that this works under mac os x when starting from
the finder, which doesn't generally set the path).

Thanks!
