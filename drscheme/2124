>Description:
message-box doesn't (currently ?) support messages longer than
200 characters.
DrScheme is using message-box to warn the user about some
actions.
DrScheme gets the messages for the warnings from one of the
multi-lingual files in the string-constants collection.
Some of these strings might be longer than 200 characters,
which makes message-box break.
I think string-constant.ss should check the length of the
strings when loading the files.
>How-To-Repeat:
Switch to the French language and submit a bug.
The final message from DrScheme after the bug has
been correctly submitted (bug-report-sent-detail)
is "Merci pour votre soumission. Vous devriez recevoir
une confirmation de votre soumission par email d'ici
30 minutes. Si vous ne recevez pas cette confirmation,
veuillez envoyer un email Ã  scheme@cs.rice.edu." which
is 206 characters long. So the user doesn't see the message,
but rather an error message from message-box saying the
string is too long...
I'll fix all the strings in french-string-constants.ss, but
other multi-lingual files might have to be corrected too,
and a check should probably be added to string-constant.ss
