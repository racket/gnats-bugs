>Description:
In the DrScheme Definitions window, you can right-click on a function/variable name and "jump" to the definition of it. This is quite useful when you are trying to understand a Scheme program. However, once you have "jumped" to the definition, there doesn't appear to be any way to return to the place you were at in the program. You can right-click on the definition and select "jump" again; however, unless the definition is only used in one place in the program (or the instance you started from is the first instance), you will not return to your original place in the program. It would be useful to have either a "return" option on the right-click menu that is active when you have "jump"ed to a definition or a shortcut key that would do this.
