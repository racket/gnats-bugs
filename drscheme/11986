>Description:
Launching multiple DrRackets in xmonad creates many error messages about an error with the preference lock file. I think this is do to the fact that DrRacket saves its geometry in the preference file, and when it creates an error message its geometry changes so it tries again.

This is on Linux.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Launch DrRacket
2. Launch DrRacket (again)
3. Click ok on first error message.
4. More error messages pop up, try to click through them, but more pop up to replace them.
5. After enouch error messages, DrRackets hang.
