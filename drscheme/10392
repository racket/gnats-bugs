>Description:
In certain situations, the stack trace window seems to think it's looking for source text in a file with filename 'unsaved-editorXYZ, which results in a file-not-found error.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a new, unsaved window.
2. At the REPL, evaluate (error 'foo)
3. Click on the stack trace icon (i.e., the left one).

You should get an internal error.

 This looks like a duplicate of PR10375.  I'm not closing it though,
 since it might have more information due to Robby's changes.

 Yes, this is a duplicate, I'm pretty sure. And I'm pretty sure I know
 what is going on, but I just have not had time to go fix it.
