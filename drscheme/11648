>Description:
Every so often, DrRacket under Windows 7 will open up a shell window with a message like:

delete-file: cannot delete file: "C:\Users\Mitch\AppData\Local\Temp\plt-sendurl-contents-file-129438439403284304894384048.html" (Permission denied;errno=13).

I don't know if it's always a plt-sendurl-contents-file-NNNNNNNNNN .
Tonite I got a shell with one and then later two such messages, both with filenames of this form.

The window identifies itself as 
C:\Program Files\Racket\DrRacket.exe .
It refuses to close until all other Racket windows have closed.

Anybody know what this might mean?
