>Description:
I appears that the coordinates wrap around in the text%.
When making an arrow in check syntax that goes from
line 1 to line 4000, the arrow starts to behave strangely.

This appears to be unfixable, from Scheme -- the coordinate
system of mred is wrapable fixnums somewhere.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; use this to create the file:
(call-with-output-file "tmp.ss"
  (lambda (port)
    (display "(lambda (x)" port)
    (let loop ([n 4000])
      (unless (zero? n)
        (display #\newline port)
        (loop (- n 1))))
    (display "x)" port))
  'truncate)

;; open the file and check syntax it in graphical scheme.
;; move the mouse over either `x' and tack the arrow.
;; now see wierd stuff when you scroll around.

 Is it that text% reports the wrong results, or that Check Syntax tries
 to draw a line to a position that's beyond [-16k,+16k] in the y-axis?
 
 My guess is the latter, since text% locations are used by a lot of code
 that works with long files (i.e, 4000 lines is not many).

 Yes, I think that you are right -- check syntax is trying to draw a
 line whose start and end points are out of range. It is just getting
 and passing off the numbers returned by position-location, tho. So, I
 think that I'm still stuck.

 See your `hilight-range' code in plt/collects/framework/private/text.ss.
 
 Though I don't quite understand why `highlight-range' calls `get-view'.
 The arguments to `on-paint' already provide that information, except
 that it's more precise (if the repainted region is not the whole
 visible region).
