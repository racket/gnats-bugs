>Description:
The syntax checker highlights references to functions that
are provide/contract-ed from a module as being keywords and
not bound indentifiers. The definitions are highlighted
properly but they do not have arrows pointing to the
provide/contract reference. The function's name in the
provide/contract itself is the color of constants.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module m mzscheme
  
  (require
   (lib "specs.ss" "framework"))
  
  (provide/contract
   (plus (number? . -> . number?)))
  
  (define (plus a b)
    (+ a b)))

(require m)
(plus 1 1)
;;run check syntax. note the color of "plus" on the last
;;line and in the provide/contract. mouse over the
;;deffiniton and note the lack of arrows

 FWIW, imported, contracted functions *are* keywords. It's wierd, but
 that's how it works (internally). I'm not sure if that will change soon.
