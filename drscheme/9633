>Description:
The C-\ shortcut, which is intended to work as follows:

\alpha<C-\> inserts the first greek lowercase letter is not mentioned in the documentation for DrScheme keyboard shortcuts.

Also, it appears not to work at all on linux.  Every time I hit C-\, I get a lambda character at the insertion point, and no change to anything else.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Mon, 16 Mar 2009 01:15:33 -0400
Reason>>> FWIW, it works fine for me -- but it uses M-\ so perhaps
this is only a documentation problem
