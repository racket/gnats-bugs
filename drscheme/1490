>Description:
the alt-t binding is corrupted while something is executing 
in the repl
>How-To-Repeat:
create program that runs for a long time 

place cursor in definitions window say between two S-expressions 
and hit alt-t

on occasion, it swaps things [the program where i could do that 
  is too long to include, it spawned a window]

on others, it just makes the cursor disappear

on yet others, it moves on the next word

 During execution, the "execute" menu is disabled, so the alt-t keybinding is being picked up by the editor. Alt-t (in the editor) is bound to "transpose two words and move forward a word". But, during execution, the editor is locked, so this becomes "mov e forward a word". That is why you see the behavior that you see.
 
 Use alt-k to kill the current evaluation and then use alt-t to make a new one.
 
 This is fairly easy to reproduce with the program "(let l()(l))".
 
 As far as things disappearing goes, I could not reproduce that.

 It sometimes transposes, too. I will see what I can do. 
 
 [I figured out an explanation along those lines.]
