>Description:
Hi folks,
I am preparing a blog post on how to do keybinding the right way, now that Robby Findler has enlightened me, and I want to make sure I get it right.  I was looking at the examples at the bottom of http://pre.plt-scheme.org/docs/html/mred/mred-Z-H-905.html#node_tag_Temp_906, and it occurs to me that where there is simply a space before a modifier key, the description fits the definition of what happens when you prepend a tilde to a modifier key; that is, it only matches states in which the following modifier key is NOT pressed.  Here is the existing documentation:
----------------------------------------------
Examples:

    * "space" -- matches whenever the space bar is pressed, regardless of the state of modifiers keys.

    * " c:space" -- matches whenever the space bar is pressed and the Control key is not pressed.

    * "a" -- matches whenever ``a'' is typed, regardless of the state of modifiers keys (other than Shift).

    * ":a" -- matches only when ``a'' is typed with no modifier keys pressed.

    * " c:a" -- matches whenever ``a'' is typed and neither the Shift key nor the Control key is pressed.

    * ":esc;:c:c" -- matches an Escape key press (no modifiers) followed by a Control-C press (no modifiers other than Control).

    * "?:d:+" -- matches when Command is pressed with key that produces ``+'', even if producing ``+'' normally requires pressing Shift.
----------------------------------------------

If I'm understanding the narrative correctly, I think should be written as:

----------------------------------------------
Examples:

    * "space" -- matches whenever the space bar is pressed, regardless of the state of modifiers keys.

    * "~c:space" -- matches whenever the space bar is pressed and the Control key is not pressed.

    * "a" -- matches whenever ``a'' is typed, regardless of the state of modifiers keys (other than Shift).

    * ":a" -- matches only when ``a'' is typed with no modifier keys pressed.

    * "~c:a" -- matches whenever ``a'' is typed and neither the Shift key nor the Control key is pressed.

    * ":esc;:c:c" -- matches an Escape key press (no modifiers) followed by a Control-C press (no modifiers other than Control).

    * "?:d:+" -- matches when Command is pressed with key that produces ``+'', even if producing ``+'' normally requires pressing Shift.

----------------------------------------------

Either way, could you please clarify this for me so I don't represent the process incorrectly.

I appreciate it.

Thanks,

--kyle

Reason>>> Perhaps Matthew fixed it?
