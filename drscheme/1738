>Description:
Enter in Def window

(define (! n)
  (if (= 0 n)
      (begin (display (continuation-mark-set->list (current-continuation-marks) 'a))
             1)
      (with-continuation-mark 'a n (* n (! (- n 1))))))

Click on check syntax 

it stops annotation in the middle of the program
i can no longer select in the def window afterwards, 
indeed, i think i can't even edit 

now click on execute

things revert. oops
