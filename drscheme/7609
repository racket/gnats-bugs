Some saved files are generating an error when they are opened.
insert-file in text%: error loading the file

It seems to be related to using boxes to comment out text,
but sometimes files saved with boxes open okay.

I had contacted you about this problem earlier.  I believe that we have updated to the current version, but the problem is still occuring - with files created by the newest version.

Thank you,
Charlotte
>How-To-Repeat:
Only seems to happen when lines are commented out with a box, but it doesn't always happen then.

 As far as we know, this is strictly a v299.200 problem, unless there
 is a new problem that we do not know about.  I just tried using
 comment boxes and had no problems at all.  I am going to close this
 bug now, please re-open it if you find a reproducible sequence of
 actions that lead to the problem using v299.400.
