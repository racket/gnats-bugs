>Description:
See below
>How-To-Repeat:
Open prefs dialog
Go to the "Color" panel, the "Scheme"
Pick a new color (clicking "Ok" in the
  color-chooser dialog)
Click Cancel in the prefs dialog
  => color is still changed
>Fix:
The preferences dialog was mutating a style delta to effect the changes. The cancel button works by copying bindings and restoring them -- it doesn't copy the objects bound. So, to fix this, I just made the preferences dialog avoid mutating the style delta that it gets from the preferences system.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation. It would not have been a type error either.

 Did you see some of this output, by chance?

 PS: I can't re what an "invalidated" object is -- is it one that's
 been shutdown by a custodian?

 Hm. Looks like that invalidated thing was just a fluke and unrelated
 to the actual bug (which I've now fixed).
 
 I've closed the PR.
