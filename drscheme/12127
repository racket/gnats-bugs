>Description:
I saw this problem a few times in older 5.x versions that persists in
the current one: sometimes the screen does not properly redraw.  This
is on a pretty vanilla (but with all MS updates) Windows 7.  For
instance, I fire up a 5.1.3 (with the REPL displaying to the right,
not below).  I use File | Open Recent... to open a file.  The editor
has the right content, but the REPL looks like

-----


>
-----

As I *select* in the REPL, the text appears:

-----
Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.1.3 [3m].
Language: Advanced Student [custom]; memory limit: 128 MB.
Teachpacks: universe.ss and image.ss.
> 
-----

I cannot reproduce this reliably.  I have seen this lack-of-redraw
problem in the editor window also, usually when there is some kind of
overlay atop the text (error highlighting, etc) -- again,
sporadically, not reliably.
