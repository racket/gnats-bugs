>Description:
It is possible to get drscheme to display the meta data that 
it saves when writing out a file that's written in the teaching 
languages. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Save file.ss from BSL. Have (define foo <picture>) in first line. 

Use 'open file.ss' from some shell to open a file in a
running drscheme. (Other tabs are ISL with Lambda.) 

Delete the first line with cmd-k. 

Undo with cmd-z. Undo again and voila you get the meta data. 

(I'll send in one of the files that did t for me.) 
>Fix:
The begin-edit-sequence surrounding the insertion and removal of the metadata should have passed #f as the 'undoable?' argument.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation. It would not have been a type error, either.

 Thanks -- you don't need to send more. That worked for me.
