>Description:
When i create a program in version 103 that loads more
than one file (as part of the definitions) at the beginning
it works fine as long as i keep using version 103. When i 
use the computers at school, which use version 102, it 
refuses to open more than one file from executing the
program definitions. Instead, i have to load the file from
the interactions window.

ex:
(current-directory "c:/program files/plt/")
(load "initdr.scm")
(load "matrices.scm")

The above code works fine in version 103, both files get
loaded when i execute. When i use version 102 though, it
won't open the second file. I think this might be a
backwards-compatibility problem. I believe that programs
that i have made using ONLY version 102 will load more
than one file.

 Unfortunately, we no longer suport 102 (certainly we will not fix bugs
 in 102!). But, if you can send me a small example that explains the
 problem (please include the entire program and the output), I might be
 able to help you hack something together to be able to use both 102 and
 103.
 
 The easiest thing is probably to upgrade your school's machines,
 however.
