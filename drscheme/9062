>Description:
In 3.99, this program does not provide useful highlighting:

#lang scheme/base
(define (f)
  (map (lambda () #f) (list 1 2 3 4)))

(f)

=>  map: arity mismatch for #<procedure>: expects no arguments, given 1

It highlights nothing, whereas v371 highlighted the context 
chain, down to the offending invocation of map.

Please disregard & let me know if we're not yet ready for this 
kind of bug report.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Module language, evaluate this:

#lang scheme/base
(define (f)
  (map (lambda () #f) (list 1 2 3 4)))

(f)
>Fix:
In v4, the source locations for ports are just filenames, not the editors. This means that all of the current drscheme tools (including error reporting) that look at the source locations are going to ignore these filenames, instead of reacting to them.
>Release-Note:
There was no contract violation, nor type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 14 Nov 2007 08:36:40 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Yeah, that one had been bugging me (and Matthew :) too....
Thanks for the additional prodding.
