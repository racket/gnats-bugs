>Description:
I'm playing around with writing my own teachpacks.  I notice that in the documentation, the following example teachpack is given:

#lang scheme

(provide (rename-out :lcons lcons) lcar lcdr)

(define-struct lcons (hd tl))

(define-syntax (:lcons stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(_ hd-exp tl-exp)
     #'(make-lcons
        (delay hd-exp)
        (delay tl-exp))]))

(define (lcar lcons) (force (lcons-hd lcons)))
(define (lcdr lcons) (force (lcons-tl lcons)))

This generates the following error:

rename-out: bad syntax in: (rename-out :lcons lcons)

I don't know enough about the module system to diagnose the problem, but either the documentation is outdated or there is a bug in DrScheme.

 It should be
 
   (provide (rename-out [:lcons lcons]) lcar lcdr)
 
 Matthew/Robby -- I'm also removing the sentence that says
 
   To test it, be sure to save it in a file named
   @filepath{lazycons.ss}.
 
 since it's no longer a problem with the #lang line.
 
 (I also don't see a reason to define it as `:lcons' and providing it
 as `lcons', but I'm leaving that part alone.)

 [I didn't get the message you sent to robby@plt-scheme.org]
 
 The rename is there because the name lcons conflicts with the struct
 name (and we didn't have #:omit-define-syntaxes when the code was
 written).

 Couldn't the struct have been named something else, like lazycons?  Not 
 that it matters much.

 Sure. I just wanted (I think I wrote this code ...) the constructor
 name to be the same as the name that the values print out with.
