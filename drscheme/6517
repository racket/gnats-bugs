>Description:
The documentation for the pattern lanugage of the reduction-semantics 
package does not describe how to refer to other non-terminals in the 
language.  In fact, the examples shown indicate that a non-terminal
may be referred to directly by name.  I would amend the docs for the
pattern language as follows:

The _<symbol>_ pattern stands for >> a non-terminal in the 
language, or << a literal symbol that must
match exactly (except, of course, for any, number, string,
hole, or variable which are reserved).
