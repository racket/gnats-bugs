>Description:
While I know that keybindings are certainly a matter of personal preference, I also know that DrScheme likes to pretend it's Emacs.  I myself enjoy using DrScheme with "enable key bindings menu" turned off, so will go ahead and list the keybindings tweaks that are needed to make DrScheme's search match Emacs'.


    ctrl-s     Goes to the search box and hides the replace section.
               Pressing again searches forward.
    
    ctrl-r     Goes to the search box and hides the replace section.
               Pressing again searches backward.
    
    ctrl-w     Yanks next word from the definition window 
               onto the end of the search string.
    
    ctrt-alt-y Yanks next character from definition window
               onto end of search string.
    
    C-g        Aborts search and moves cursor back to starting point.
    
    alt-n      Fills the search box with the next item in the search ring.
    alt-p      Fills the search box with the previous item in the search ring.
    alt-TAB    Completes the text of the search box using the search ring.

    ESC        Closes the search bar (This currently works in search bar only.
               It should work in definition window too).
   
    alt-shift-5 Goes to the search box, shows the replace section
                ENTER or TAB goes to the replace box 
                ENTER again searches for the first instances

                After the second ENTER, Emacs enters a special keybinding mode
                just for replacing. I don't think this approach would work well 
                for DrScheme, but for the record Emacs's keybiding at this point are:

                   y replaces
                   n skips
                   ! to replace all
                   ^ to move back to previous match
                   E to edit the replacement string.

                One way to give keybindings to these action in DrScheme would be
                to give an underscore keyboard shortcuts to the existing buttons so that

                   alt-r replaces
                   alt-s skips

                then add a button called "replace all" with an underscore under the a.
                In this scenario there is no need for a keybinding to edit the replacement 
                string since the focus remains on the replace box while replacing.

To avoid clashes, when "enable keybindings in menu" is turned on ctrl-s will need to become ctrl-f, and ctrl-r can no longer be bound to replace.

I would be happy to help implementing some of these if you can help me out find my way around the code.  Right now I don't even know which file a should be looking at.
