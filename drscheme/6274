(file initialy displayed with some font smoothing,

- set preferences to monico 10, smothing: none

   which is set to only disable smoothing for 9pt or less)

  displayed file font to now be non-smoothed verson, magic?
>Fix:
the preferences weren't be looked up for the initial settings of
the fonts, only on font callback changes. Std problem with maintaining
multiple copies of the same state.
