>Description:
(This is a DrRacket bug, unrelated to gr2.)

Start with an empty window, then type

  #lang s-exp (file "")

and then place the cursor in the string and start typing stuff.  The toolbar is redrawn on each key, which used to be very bad with gr1, and is slightly better with gr2 (at least on linux, via vnc), but it's still bad and looks like lots of cycles are spent doing that.  (It might be worse on other platforms.)

It should probably wait a bit and redraw the toolbar only after there's no typing for a few hundred ms.
