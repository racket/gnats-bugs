>Description:
This is from a student of mine.  I am able to reproduce the steps he gave (given)
under 205 (what we have installed this term).  Collapsing sexps with images
seems to create files that cannot be re-opened without error.

>How-To-Repeat:
If you have an expression 
 
(define troll-pic <inserted troll>) 
 
and then right-click on it and choose "Collapse sexpression," it
collapses just fine- however, if you now save and close it, once you
reopen, you get an internal error: 
 
"send: target is not an object: #f for method: read" 
 
and the document is more or less shredded after this- what you end up
with, loaded into the buffer, seems to be pretty arbitrary. Except that
there is very little actually there. From there, your only option is to
dig into the file w/ a text editor and attempt to remove the binary
nonsense to get it to open again.
