>Description:
On OSX Cmd-< cycles between the windows of the application, at least for swedish keyboards. DrRacket does not honour this keyboard command, instead a '<' character is inserted into the active window.

If I use the US input method switching windows works as expected. For swedish and US input you press the exact same keys on the keyboard to switch windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open two DrRacket windows.
Select one of them.
Select the "Swedish - Pro" input method from the flag menu. (You may need to enable the swedish input method in the Language & Text part of System Preferences)
Press Cmd-< (The command key and the '<' key, which is just to the left of the 'Z' key on swedish keyboards)
