>Description:
Type following in definitions window; hit execute.

(define-struct interval (l r))
(define (random-interval min)
 (local ((define left (random min))
         (define right (random min)))
   (cond
     [(<= right left)  (random-interval min)]
     [(> (- right left) min) (random-interval min)]
     [(make-interval left right)])))

You'll get the error message

  right: name is not defined, not an argument, and not a primitive name

and the occurrence of right in the first cond clause is highlighted.

The program is clearly broken, but the error message is bogus.
Adding the missing else fixes the problem completely.

(Discovered during TeachScheme II; also broken in 207-release.)
