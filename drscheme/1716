>Description:
I have a little program that works under DrScheme, 
yet fails when I run it from MzScheme.
The program appears to be accepting input yet I
haven't typed anything yet.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's the code:

(define (test)
  (define (t cl)
    (display "test> ")
    (case (string->symbol (read-line))
      ((exit) cl)
      ((foo) (t (cons 'foo cl)))
      (else (error "don't know why this happened"))))
  (t '()))

1. Run it from DrScheme in Full-Scheme.
2. Run it from the NT Command line using MzScheme.

Results:
1. In the DrScheme environment, the program works.
2. In the NT Command line environment, the function
jumps to the error case without every letting you type.

Expected: Should work under MzScheme just like in DrScheme.

 DrScheme separates the read-eval-print-loop input from the user program's
 input. MzScheme does not.
 
 So when you evaluate `read-line' in MzScheme, you get the carruage return
 following the expression that you entered in the REPL.

                ^---- gets this carriage return

Sadly, this is one difference that we won't be able to eliminate.
