In most software, hitting Esc in the About box makes it go away.  In DrRacket, hitting Esc does nothing.  Worse, hitting space (which sometimes makes About boxes disappear) causes Help Desk to launch.

At the very least, hitting Esc should make it go poof.

 It would just go away like that if it were a modal dialog box. Is that
 what you're asking for?

 This turns out to be more of a pain that you might think, so I'll have
 to get to it later on sometime.

 I don't think it should be modal. The frame should just catch ESC to
 close.

 Great, thanks!  Modality was indeed unnecessary, though (not that I'm
 asking you to change anything now) I've never seen an About box with a
 File menu and what not.

 Doesn't every one want to copy out the list of names, print them out

 When you're Adobe, you make the credits scroll like in a movie.  It's
 much cooler to be in the movies than to have your name printed and
 pasted on your own wall.
