 I think that "Vertical Layout" can work just as well at almost a
 quarter of the length, but if not, then "Definitions besides
 Interactions" is close to the current text and still much shorter.

 I think it should be (roughly) of the form 'verb noun'.  "Use vertical
 layout" seems too vague and "Use vertical definitions/interactions layout"
 is clunky and maybe still too long? Or do you like those? Or something else?

 Align windows vertically
 Align windows horizontally 
 
 should be shorter.

 I don't see a problem with dropping the "use" verb -- there are plenty
 of verb-less examples like "Preferences", "New Tab", "Page Setup",
 etc.  But even with it, or with Matthias's suggestion, it would be
 much better than the current label.
 
 BTW, I like "Use vertical layout" more than "Align windows
 vertically", since it's unclear which windows the second is talking
 about so I prefer the more vague option.  So the summary is that my
 ordered preferences for current suggestions are:
 
   * Vertical layout
   * Use vertical layout
   * Align windows vertically
   * Use vertical definitions/interactions layout
 
 (And no, I didn't order them by length, although it turned out that
 way...)

 I prefer
 
 Split Window Vertically
 Split Window Horizontally
 
 ... because after all, this menu entry is about subdivision of space =
 (the frame), not about the alignment of two independent entities. As =

 shape of the frame doesn't change.
 
 Substituting "Frame" for window would be shorter, but might be less (or =
 more?) easily understood.

 I worry that this option seems to be too close to the "Split" menu
 item for comfort.
