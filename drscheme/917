Tab are not handleled correctly by the position counter - it only counts
characters.

That is the only bug that I report, but I have a small request:

We have an automatic submission system (written in Scheme) that restricts
line lengths on submitted programs.  Since our environment is based on a
complete [modified] copy of DrScheme, I tried to see if I can make their
life simpler using this position counter, I tried to see if it is possible
to modify the editor not to insert tabs but traced that into the do-indent
internal function in tabify in ssmode.ss in mred.  So it looks like to
modify this I'll have to copy the whole function which is extremely ugly.
I tried looking for the code that shows the location but couldn't find it
anywhere.

Another thing that I tried was to modify the application so the definitions
window will be wide enough to hold exactly 72 characters, I did manage to
modify its size, but for some strange reason, there is a problem in
computing the size of a single character so it is too short.  (btw, the
same problem happened when using get-text-extent.)

So if there are any ways to make any of these fixes I'll be very happy.

 I think we should get rid of tabs in DrScheme. As another DrScheme user
 pointed out, tabs were useful back in the age of small storage media
 and slow communication lines, but they're not so useful any more.

 Computing a size for the frame to get a character-based width in an
 editor canvas is tricky. (Terminology note: version 53's "media
 canvases" are called "editor canvases" in MrEd 100, and "buffers" are
 called "editors").
 
 There are several layers of margins leading to an editor wthin a frame:
 
  * the frame's margin around its client area
  * the canvas's margin for showing the border and scrollbars around
    it's client area
  * the editor canvas's inset for the editor within the canvas's client
    area
  * a right margin for the autowrap bitmap within the editor (only when
    autowrapping is enabled)
  * plus two more pixels to leave room for the caret
 
 To further complicate the problem, methods like `get-client-size' can
 report bogus results when the canvas is too small, which is likely if
 the frame hasn't been shown yet (because geometry management doesn't
 kick in until just before the frame is shown).
 
 Things are slightly better in 100, because MrEd never reports bogus
 values for client sizes. Also, there's a `set-line-count' method on
 editor canvases to auto-size the canvas's height to match a certain
 number of lines in the editor (a similarly tricky computation). Perhaps
 I should add a `set-line-character-count' method.
 
 I would have used a `set-line-character-count' method when I wrote a
 mailer in MrEd. Since there wasn't one, I wrote the following MrEd 100
 code that you might find useful. (Some of the method names or calling
 conventions have changed, but I don't think the code below uses any
 100-specific features).
 
   ; make-fixed-width configures an editor and its canvas for
   ;  80 columns in a fixed width font, optionally with wrapping.
   (define (make-fixed-width c e wrap? wrap-bm)
     ; c is the containing canvas
     ; e is editor
     ; wrap-bm is the autowrap bitmap
     (let ([s (send (send e get-style-list)
 		   find-named-style "Standard")])
       (send s set-delta
 	    (make-object style-delta% 'change-family 'modern))
       (send e set-tabs null 8 #f)
       (let ([font (send s get-font)]
 	    [dc (send c get-dc)]
 	    [wbox (box 0)]
 	    [hbox (box 0)])
 	(send e get-view-size wbox hbox) ; gets current editor area in canvas
 	(let-values ([(w h) (send c get-size)]
 		     [(1w 1h d a) (send dc get-text-extent "X" font)])
 	  (let ([80chars (+ (* 1w 80)
 			    2 ; +2 for caret - yuck
 			    (if wrap-bm 
 				(send wrap-bm get-width) 
 				0))])
 	    (when wrap? 
 	      (when wrap-bm 
 		(send e set-autowrap-bitmap wrap-bm))
 	      (send e set-max-width 80chars))
 	    (send c min-width 
 		  (inexact->exact (round (+ 80chars (- w (unbox wbox)))))))))))
 
 Somehow you have to make sure the canvas is big enough before using the
 above code. The frame's `force-redraw' method applies geometry
 management sizing without showing the frame. Something like the above
 code can then set the minimum size of the canvas. Make the frame
 non-stretchy in the horizontal direction to enforce the N-column width.
 
 Hope that helps,
 Matthew

fixed for release in 100. DrScheme no longer inserts tab characters when
tabbifing lines.
