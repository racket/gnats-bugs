>Description:
I just built 299 and configured it to use a dark background to match my
Emacs windows; this of course requires choosing a light font color for
legibility.  Unfortunately, other windows pick up the font color choice but
not the background color; this includes the help desk, any errors signaled
by check syntax, and the main text entry boxes in the bug submission form.
As a result, they have (almost) white text on a white background and are
therefore completely unreadable.  (I'm writing this in an Emacs window as a
result.)

I think this particular problem is going to take a fair amount of effort to
address, unfortunately.  The lesson that I think we need to take from X and
Emacs on this point is that, once you allow the user to choose alternative
background colors, you have to let them configure *every* text color used
in the system (with the possible exception of, for instance, the tool
buttons across the top of DrScheme's windows).  Emacs got this right: font
configuration may not be easy or pretty, but it's possible for just about
every font in the system.  In contrast, Windows (at least NT 3.5/4.0, which
was the last time I tried this) didn't: you can set your default background
to be dark, but you end up with lots of things in the system that have,
e.g., black text on a dark blue background.
>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce: set your DrScheme prefs to white text on a black background,
then open the help desk.  The links will show up, but nothing else.
>Fix:
The bug: I was setting way too many colors by that one pref. Now
the pref only sets a fixed style and everyone has to declare that
they want that style (rather than the reverse). Help Desk doesn't
use the style anymore.
>Release-Note:
There was no contract violation here. Just bad behavior.

 This is one of those things where research vs technology building is 
 the real trade-off. -- Matthias

 I think Richard exaggerates the problem. I don't plan on supporting
 white on black anywhere but in the definitions window for now. I'll fix
 the bug in Help Desk.

 Lo, on Saturday, October 9, Robby Findler did write:
 
 > I think Richard exaggerates the problem.
 
 Only in that I assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that we wanted configurable
 backgrounds to apply to most of DrScheme's windows.  I can address that
 point as well as Matthias's by restating the problem:
 
     If you support configurable background colors, then you need to make
     all font colors configurable as well.
 
 There are two obvious ways to preserve this implication's truth while
 not unduly distracting ourselves from research:
 
  - roll back the background-color configuration completely; or
 
  - fix the font color preference so it applies only to DrScheme
    definitions and editor windows.
 
 Personally, I don't really care that much whether DrScheme has
 configurable backgrounds or not.  They'd be nice, but I still use Emacs
 and Quack as my primary Scheme editor anyway.
 
                                * * * * *
 
 Finally, a meta-question: what do we see as DrScheme's primary purpose,
 anyway?  I think the fact that Matthias responds to more than a few of
 my bug reports by re-iterating that we are a research shop not a
 software shop stems from the fact that I, at least, have a very
 different conception of what DrScheme is for than do the PLT leadership.
 If we shared the same understanding, then I could save everyone's time
 and trouble and not bother with the bug reports anymore.

 DrScheme must stay real and polished, so that we can claim that our 
 work implements more than that of every other research group. But there 
 are frills where we need to question whether it's worth our effort. 
 Background color is not it. -- Matthias

 This is something that people have been asking for, off and on, for
 years (much like configurable keybindings). In this case, I'm not
 unhappy doing the work, esp. given the apparent level of interest. In
 fact, for what we have done so far (supporting dark background a color
 in the definitions & interactions window) is not even that much work.
 
 Help desk would be harder because there are lots of colors in there and
 we'd have to re-do our documentation (the colors are hard-wired into
 the HTML). For now, that is not worth it, but I never say never.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 11 Oct 2004 19:39:02 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to CVS. The font colors in Help Desk still aren't
configurable and probably won't be for the near future. But, it should
work to have white on black in the main drscheme window without
breaking other things now.
