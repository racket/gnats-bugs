>Description:
The ps-setup% object in `current-ps-setup' is
mutable, so DrScheme needs to create a new one
for each user thread.

(In retrospect, ps-setup% objects should be
immutable to avoid this kind of problem. Maybe v201.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Choose a MrEd language in DrScheme
Mutate (current-ps-setup)
Click execute
Mutations to (current-ps-setup) are still there

 Here's a bad program:
 
 (define b1 (box 0))
 (define b2 (box 0))
 (send (current-ps-setup) get-scaling b1 b2)
 b1
 b2
 (send (current-ps-setup) set-scaling 3 3)
 (send (current-ps-setup) get-scaling b1 b2)
 b1
 b2
