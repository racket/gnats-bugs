>Description:
The "Discard all saved bug reports" entry appears only where there are two or more
saved reports.  I'm guessing that the intention is that when you have a single report
you'll just re-open it and hit "cancel" -- but it took me a while to get this...  Even
if it is the intention, the cancel thing is much more annoying -- since I need to open
the window, click cancel, and answer the confirmation dialog.  (Twice... See PR 11641.)
It seems like an oddly inconsistent UI for canceling a single report to require confirmation, and canceling many succeeds silently.
