a.ss:

 (/ 1 0)

b.ss:

Run "a.ss" in DrScheme. You get the expected error.

Run "b.ss" in DrScheme. You get the expected error
 from "a.ss", but "b.ss" continues running, so that
 'done is printed in the interactions window.

 I'm not having a lot of luck tracking this down. Disabling tools
 doesn't make the problem go away.
 
 I tried printing out the stack trace when the error message is
 printed, but it doesn't seem to have the relevant stack frame that
 would give away the culprit (it is below). I tried printing out the
 arguments to call-with-exception-handler, but that doesn't seem to
 help either (grepping for call-with-exception-handler doesn't seem to
 turn up anything interesting). Current-module-name-resolver doesn't
 seem to being set ... any other parameters that come to mind to try
 grepping for?

 It appears that getting rid of all .zo files (and starting up
 drscheme) makes the behavior go away. I don't suppose that's a useful
 clue....?

 No, I got that wrong. _Something_ made the bug go away, but it wasn't
 the absence of .zo files. svn status shows no files different from the
 repository and yet I'm not seeing the bug anymore. All I've been doing
 is putting in and taking out printfs, so I have no idea what happened.

 It's gone for me, too (but I got several new files with an svn update).

 I think it went away for me without svn updating. Maybe.
