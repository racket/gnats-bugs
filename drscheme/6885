>Description:
This is the documentation for drscheme-language-positions in the PLT Tools manual:

  This must be bound to a list of language positions. Each language position corresponds to the position of the language in language dialog. Each language position is a list of strings.

Actually, each language position must be a list of at least two strings, the first being the top-level category (e.g. "Experimental Languages").

 When this is fixed, then there should probably be a mention of using
   (require (lib "string-constant.ss" "string-constants"))
 and then using
   (string-constant ...)
 if it's one of the existing languages.

 Yes, I noticed that I can't actually put my language into the
 "Experimental Languages" category:
 
   add-language: language "Slideshow"; expected number for "Experimental Languages" to be 0, got 1000
 
 But if I try to require string-constant.ss, I get this:
 
   info.ss:2:2: infotab-module: not a well-formed definition at: (require (lib "string-constant.ss" "string-constants")) in: (#%module-begin (require (lib "string-constant.ss" "string-constants")) (define name "Socrates") ...

 All uses of a particular name (in this case "Experimental Languages")
 must have the same number (1000 in this case). Is this not clear in the
 docs? (where were you looking?)

 Are you using CVS or v207?

 I'm looking at the PLT Tools manual:
 
   drscheme-language-numbers
   This is optional. If present, it must be a list of a list of
   numbers. Each list corresponds to a single language from this
   collection. Each number indicates a sorting order in the language
   dialog for the corresponding string in drscheme-language-positions. If
   absent, it defaults to a list of zeros that has the same length as
   drscheme-language-numbers. This will rarely be correct.
 
 I didn't get far beyond "This is optional."  :)
 
 I added a drscheme-language-numbers binding, (1000 0), and now it
 works.  Seems more than a little arcane, though.

 I'm using exp-tagged CVS, as of a few days ago, i.e. v207.1.  Does
 v299 infotab accept `require' statements now?

 I thought Eli had already added that, but judging from his message,
 it's still on his todo list. Shouldn't be long, I expect.

 It's there, in both the exp and the 299 versions.

 Works now, thanks.
 
 I still don't understand where the "language numbers" come from, though...

 They determine the order of the names at a given level.

 I figured out what they *do*, I just don't know how they get
 assigned.  E.g. why is experimental-languages 1000, and what should I
 set my language's subcategory number to?  (I set it to 1000 also,
 since it seems like it should go at the end, but what if someone else
 picks 1000, or 999, or 1001?)

 There's no requirement except that when a given entry appears in two
 different language's lists, the values are the same. That is, if I
 register a tool:
 
   '("Experimental Languages" "Beta")
 
 and you register one:
 
   '("Experimental Languages" "Snobol")
 
 we both have the pick the same number for "Experimental Languages".
