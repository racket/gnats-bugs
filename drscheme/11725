>Description:
I'm running 5.0.99.900+57~g98dd05c.

In the Dr Racket Debugger, the first time I press the step button it works, but the second time it just highlights the button and nothing happens. Stopping the debugger works, and and moving the cursor off the step button and back on lets me step again.

I _think_ this has something to do with my (tiling) window manager xmonad. 
I did try 5.0.2 with gnome and that works OK (as I'm sure many people can verify). Also, on #racket, 'rapacity' reports a recent git version works ok for him in another tiling window manager.

It's not a perfect report, I know, but I'll try to follow up with more testing when I get a chance.

 Sorry for the two part report, I couldn't de-install racket while using
 it to report a bug ;).
 
 Anyway, I verified that the step button works ok for me in 5.0.2 in
 xmonad. So maybe this is just a regression from 5.0.2 to 5.1 and nothing
 to do with xmonad.  I have not yet had a chance to test 5.1 in gnome.
