>Release:        unknown
>Environment:
	v53
>Description:
	alpha renaming still fails to work with certain locals
>How-To-Repeat:

Set language level to intermediate. (maybe need to execute in another
language level first)

	Type in definitions: 
	(define m 10000)

	(define (integrate x)
	  (local ((define h (* 2 m)))
	    m))
	Check Syntax
	Attempt to alpha-rename m to M
	Error box shows up

>Fix:
	I have encountered alpha renaming bugs in 52 and 53/n. 
	They didn't show up so far and I have used alpha renaming quite a
	bit. This kind of intermittent failure is frustrating.

 I cannot reproduce this. Are you using the latest version? (53)

 Yes, and you can come out to watch it fail on my laptop. It's totally weird
 to me.

 Okay, how about tommorrow sometime? I will check with "-x" tommorrow just
 to be sure that I don't have a version skew problem.
