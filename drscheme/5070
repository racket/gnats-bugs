>Description:
While running a particularly large computation in DrScheme, I 
received the following error message:

refresh-delayed? is #t but snip admin, #<struct:editor-admin%>, 
is not an editor-snip-editor-admin<%>

It popped up several times during the compuation.

My program had consumed an unusually large amount of memory at
the time.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, I can't reproduce this bug reliably.
