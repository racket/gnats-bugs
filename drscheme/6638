>Description:
right-clicking text from the standard output port (i.e., the purple text) doesn't give a context menu but rather the following error message:

"backward-containing-sexp: called on a color:text<%> whose colorer is stopped."
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Latest nightly build as of 1/9/04
2. Run a program that produces stdout text in DrScheme
3. After the program finishes, right-click on the purple text.
>Fix:
transparent-io-text% in drscheme/private/rep.ss now calls the start-colorer method it inherits from color-text.

 I'm going to assume that you are going to look into this. From what I
 can tell, the error message is overzealous in this case (when the
 colorer is stopped but still up to date?)

 That isn't the problem.  The colorer is never started for the 
 transparent-io-text%.  Do we even want to treat that output as Scheme 
 text?

 Before, we had people ask for it, since they wanted to see the grey
 region in their output. I don't think that we want to color things,
 however.

 We can have a gray region without the text being interpreted as Scheme.
 We could use a lexer that only looks for parenthesis characters, which 
 will not give a correct Scheme highlighting of parens, but it will work 
 much better in cases where users print out text that is not 
 syntactically valid Scheme.  What do you think?

 That sounds good to me.
 
 Would this require a separate thread per editor?

 Every color:text% has a separate thread associated with it that is 
 created the first time the start method is called.  This is true 
 regardless of the lexer given to the start method.

 That sounds like a lot of threads in the case of the interactions
 window. Guess that's too bad, tho. Seems better than the current
 situation.
 
 Maybe in the future, it might make sense to have a single thread per
 editor-canvas instead?
