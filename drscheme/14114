>Description:
I find it very distracting when I write code in DrR (especially in
class) where the status bar text keeps flickering with the delayed
background-expansion text and then back to the red error message if I
have one.  But even without an error it is still very distracting to
have some random text show there, and worse, it is not a good piece of
text: "background" is an implementation detail, and "expansion" is
something that is too advanced for many beginners (and probably most
students).

Therefore, I think that the following small change would make things
much better:

* Get rid of the "Background expansion ..." messages, and instead use
  some alternative indicator.  Using the stick figure for this would
  be cute, but just the colored dot should be sufficient too.  (Ie,
  whatever is sufficient to ask people about it if there is some
  suspicious behavior with it.)

* Just update status bar with a red error message at the end of the
  expansion or with nothing if there is no error.

So if the colored dot has all of the information that is indicated in
text, a cheap implementation of all of this is to just get rid of the
messages.

The effect of that would be, IMO, a much more pleasant editing
experience.  Eg, if I'm tweaking some number the status will not show
anything throughout the editing, if I'm editing some identifier, it
will be mostly red until I'm done and have the right name, and if I'm
one of these people who don't use always-balanced parens and quotes,
then when I type some definition I'll see the same red read error
during the whole definition with just the location changing for nested
unclosed parens.

 I can do something like this, but I have a question. What if, when you
 finish editing, you actually have a program with a syntax error. In your
 imagined, different UI, will the error text be visible or not? And if so,
 how does drracket know to hide the other ones and not that one?

 I'm not asking to hide any error messages, of course.  (That would be
 losing valuable information.)  I'm just asking to not show the
 "administrative" messages which result in the distracting random text
 flashes.
 
 To clarify, if you type in "(+ 1 2)" in sequence, or anything with a
 syntax error that sticks for a while, you see this at the bottom:
 
   [1] nothing
   [2] bg expansion pending
   [3] red reading error
   [1], [2], [3], [1], [2], [3], ... [2]
   [4] bg expansion finished
 
 What I'm suggesting is to get rid of the [1]s, [2]s, and [4]s, so in
 the above case you'll see the red error after the "(", and it goes
 away when you type ")".

 Yes, I completely agree that it's good to have the errors be very
 visible, but having them visible *and* flickering is the annoying
 thing.  So what I'm suggesting will eliminate the flicker, but keep
 the nice big text.

 (I don't mind having the text area always be there, but this is a
 different issue.  (Which is not what it does now, BTW.))

 Hopefully the above clarifies it.  Do you see any loss of
 discoverability in it?

 Yes, thanks; that helped me a lot. To confirm: there would still be screen
 real-estate (sometimes with nothing in it) starting after the first
 occurrence of [3] and then not going away (until the "x" is clicked), right?

 Yes.  Two quick side-notes:
 
 1. The space could be reclaimed if the expansion went fine and there's
    nothing there.  But I agree with Sam that it will be annoying to
    have the spaces taken and returned.
 
 2. If people really feel that some positive confirmation is useful,
    then it could still be there with no flickers, but in that case I'd
    rather have some more understandable text.  Plus, it would be a
    change from what it does now anyway, since the status is not shown
    if there was no error.
