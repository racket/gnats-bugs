>Description:
This is related to PR 10142 -- but it is manifesting itself in a much more ugly
manner.

If:
 - file B has an embedded image as part of its source code, and
 - file A requires file B, *and*
 - you run file A in the custom module mode where the 
   "no debugging or profiling" radio button is selected 
   (and thus the "automatically compile source files" check box is then checked 
    by default (at least on my installation)), 

Then: you get the following error when attempting to run file A:

. . ../../../../../Applications/PLT Scheme v4.1.4/collects/compiler/cm.ss:186:6: write: cannot marshal constant that is embedded in compiled code: #<object:cache-image-snip%>

This is especially bad because the error message does not even tell the reader 
which file is the one with the embedded snip.

The fact that the mzc limitation I reported in PR 10142 has leaked out to 
DrScheme's UI implies to me that this cannot be classified as a mere 
documentation oversight; this is a software bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.) From DrScheme's REPL:

  Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.4 [3m].
  Language: Module; memory limit: 1024 megabytes.
  > (require htdp/image)
  > (circle 30 'solid 'red)

2.) Copy and paste resulting circle snip into Definitons window.

3.) Save Definitions as "plt-custom-compile-bug.ss"

4.) Open new tab

5.) Type:

  #lang scheme
  (require "plt-custom-compile-bug.ss")

6.) Save file as "plt-custom-compile-bug2.ss"

7.) Choose Language: module, and Show Details.. select "No debugging or profiling"
    (and for me, you do *not* need to then explicitly check the "automatically 
     compile source files" checkbox, which I assume is the actual cause of
     the problem.)

8.) Hit Run.  Observe error.

 Oh, man. I completely forgot that that code was in the trunk or I
 would have disabled it for the release! This is a bug, and it would be
 nice if compilation supported images, but at the moment it just has to
 be a drscheme-level bug for not coping with it properly.
