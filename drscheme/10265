 I think this is an editor bug. This is the click-in-overview method:
 
     (define/public (click-in-overview pos)
       (when shown?
         (let* ([d-text (get-delegated-text)]
                [d-canvas (send d-text get-canvas)]
                [bx (box 0)]
                [by (box 0)])
           (let-values ([(cw ch) (send d-canvas get-client-size)])
             (send d-text position-location pos bx by)
             (send d-canvas focus)
             (send d-canvas scroll-to
                   (- (unbox bx) (/ cw 2))
                   (- (unbox by) (/ ch 2))
                   cw
                   ch
                   #t)
             (send d-text set-position pos)))))
 
 Possibly some quotient call should be a division and a floor?
 
 Or maybe scroll-to should be checking its arguments more and it is a
 bug in this function?
