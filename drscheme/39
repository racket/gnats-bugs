drscheme -x on nw
>Description:
If I try to reference-library a library that has multiple values in
it, I am encountering a problem.  The error doesn't seem to be in M3,
however (or if it is, I'm missing why this is so).
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up drscheme -x on nw.  In the REPL, enter

  (require-library "referf.ss")

and you will get this error:

  referf.ss: 6.3-44.74: context expected 1 value, received 2 values: #<procedure> #<procedure>

I have checked that M3 correctly expands the contents of the file, so
I suspect the problem is in the definition of require-library.
However, this error doesn't take place in MzScheme.
