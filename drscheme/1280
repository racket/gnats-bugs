>Description:
When you send a bug report via Help Desk,
     a "Sending Bug Report" dialog appears
     while the PR is sent.
     
The dialog has no parent, so it appears in
a random place on my desktop. It would appear in
a sensible place if the dialog were a child of
the report window.

>How-To-Repeat:
Submit a bug report, preferably from a slow network connection
