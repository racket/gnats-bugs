 I suspect you have an error in your configuration. This does not happen
 for me. Did you use that same drscheme that has the wrong version
 number to submit the pr? If not, please try to use the bad drs version
 to submit the pr in the future; in fact, re-submitting this pr would be
 helpful. If so, you were not running 101.

 I was running x-help-desk separately.
 
 The DrScheme I ran was the installed version on 
 CSNet.

         I suspect you have an error in your configuration. 
         This does not happen for me. 
 
 I've discovered that the bug occurs only after you run Spidey on a 
 file.  So it's some interaction between Spidey and DrScheme.
