>Description:
On a shared Help Desk server, when a user submits
a search, the selected search options can sometimes 
affect other users.

I just got bitten by this bug.

I know how to fix this -- just a reminder to myself.

State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: steck
State-Changed-When: Mon Sep 23 11:28:04 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed.
    
    The search-type and match-type are now stored as preferences, so those choices persist between invocations
    of Help Desk.
    
    The search-type and match-type used for external searches
    are stored as preferences.  Not sure if this is the Right
    Thing.

 What do you mean by external searches? 
 
 DrScheme calls methods that specify what kind of search to perform, so
 I hope that hasn't changed.
