 Bad news: Dang the failure is intermittent.
 
 Good news: I have been able to repeat it by accident twice with this  
 short program:
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 
 (define (i _) (nw:rectangle 100 100 "solid" "red"))
 
 (define (main x)
    (big-bang (* 10 x) (on-draw i) (stop-when zero?) (on-tick sub1)))
 
 BUT I have no clue what actions I performed to repeat it. At some  
 point I thought it had to do with editing the definitions window  
 before running a second time. Not true.

 This is definitely a bug in DrScheme/mzscheme somewhere, but I have no
 real clue on how to proceed except by eliminating as much of universe
 and then eliminating as much of drscheme as I can and handing the pr
 on to Matthew.

 p.s. it is plain silly to assign this to me because it happens 
 with universe. DrRacket is the layer that manages the custodian
 for such windows not the teachpacks.

 No, they involve any window-opening teachpack.

 I'm going to assign it to you, as I think the only reproductions
 involve using world/universe.

 Are there any examples with simpler teachpacks?  The plan Robby
 suggested for this bug was that you first reduce the portion of the
 bug related to universe.

 I don't think that anyone has had the energy to investigate this PR. I
