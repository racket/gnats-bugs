>Description:
The following indentation is reproduced literally from 
a DrScheme definitions window: 

(make-object 
    (make-refresh-canvas (lambda () (draw-track current-position)))
  frame)

I would expect it to look more like this: 

(fall-bumps-fallara
 (make-foo ...)
 10)

;; Here is how I discovered it: 

; track% : [(draw-track : number -> void)]
(define track% 
  (class* object% () ()
    (private
      [train-canvas
       (make-object 
           (make-refresh-canvas (lambda () (draw-track current-position)))
         frame)])))

 make-object is treated as a special form for the tabber. If you don't
 put the class on the same line, things look funny to remind you not
 to forget the class. Another benefit:
 
   (make-object frame%
     "a"
     "b")
 
 is much nicer when "A" and "b" are very long than:
 
   (make-object frame%
                "a"
                "b")

that is the way that make-object indents. It is treated specially.
