>Description:
I started a new drscheme process and the very first thing I did was eval `integer-size' in the interactions window and this ACK! happened.  It continues to happen every time I eval an undefined identifier.  However, it only happens when the drscheme process runs as a particular user.  When I run drscheme as any other user, this ACK! does not happen, only the correct undefined identifier error happens; I can repeat this by starting new drscheme processes as the various users.  For what it's worth, I just installed 369.6 and the user-specific config stuff for 360 is still in the users' home directories, and as I write this I have not yet terminated the first drscheme process which caused the bug.  I don't know enough about DrScheme to know how to investigate this further.
>How-To-Repeat:
> integer-size
ACK! didn't find drscheme's stackframe when filtering

> integer-size

> integer-length
#<primitive:integer-length>

>Fix:
mzscheme sometimes just doen'st have any stack trace information. so, in those cases, the message is now suppressed.
>Release-Note:
In some sense, the message itself is a contract violation. if you take that point of view, the contract was wrong and has been fixed.

 When you are running as the user that causes the acks, do you have any
 plt packages installed? Perhaps via planet? (you can check planet by
 doing "planet -p" from the commandline from the two users and see if
 the output differs)

 What customization of the mzscheme language level did you do?

 Ah ha, having "Dynamic Properties" set to "No debugging or profiling" enables the bug, in 369.6
 and not 360.  When any of the users have it set to this, they all get the ack, and when any of
 them have it set to any of the other three choices, none of them get the ack.  Here's their
 original language level customizations:
 
 user me:
 ---------
 Input Syntax: Case sensitive
 Dynamic Properties: No debugging or profiling
 Output Style: write
 Insert newlines in printed values
 
 user zone:
 ---------
 Input Syntax: Case sensitive
 Dynamic Properties: Debugging and profiling
 Output Style: write
 Insert newlines in printed values
 
 user plt:
 ---------
 Input Syntax: Case sensitive
 Dynamic Properties: Debugging
 Output Style: write
 Insert newlines in printed values

 Hm. I'm still having trouble making it happen. Do you just put, say,
 
   x
 
 in the definitions window, click execute and then get the ACK message?

 Yes.  Or the interactions window.  If it's the first thing done or if it's done after opening
 other windows/tabs and executing other things.  If the undefined identifier is top-level or
 nested.  Seems to happen anytime anywhere an undefined identifer is evaluated.
 
 My 369.6 is compiled by me from plt-clean.tgz, using my own Gentoo ebuild derived from the
 official ebuild, with
 
 configure --prefix=/usr --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info
 --datadir=/usr/share --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var/lib --enable-mred --enable-shared
 --enable-lt=/usr/bin/libtool --disable-backtrace --enable-cairo --enable-libjpeg --enable-gl
 --disable-perl --enable-libpng --disable-sgc --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu
 
 CFLAGS=-march=pentium3 -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer
 
 and some Gentoo-specific "elibtoolize" patches Gentoo automatically applies (not sure what they
 do), and a -fPIC patch the drscheme-369.6.ebuild applies to every relevant (I'm assuming)
 location.
 
 I'm going to try building a vanilla 369.6 from plt-clean.tgz without using any of the Gentoo stuff
 and then see if the bug still happens.

 It is unlikely to be affected by the build environment (assuming the
 build actually completes).

 I just tried with a new vanilla build (just --prefix=/tmp/369.6 --enable-shared, and no CFLAGS)
 and the bug does not happen, and it still happens with the other build.  If it's not the build
 environment, maybe the install environment is somehow influencing the bug?

 It seems very likely to be something at the Scheme level, perhaps
 triggered by planet or your prefs or something. But I'm not sure.

 I ran the new vanilla build which does not ACK! and the other build which does as the same user,
 and since both are 369.6 doesn't that mean the prefs and planet stuff are exactly the same?

 Yes, it does.
 
 What went into the non-vanilla build?
 
 BTW, thanks for all your help debugging this.

 Matthew: Derick has kindly let me login to his machine to try to
 figure out what is causing this problem. He actually has several
 builds on his machine, and not all of them exhibit the problem.
 
 Anyways, from what I can tell, the broken version just never seems to
 have a mzscheme-level stacktrace. Eg, this program:
 
   % mzscheme
   Welcome to MzScheme v369.6 [3m], Copyright (c) 2004-2007 PLT Scheme Inc.
   > (define (f x) (+ (x)))
   > (f (lambda () unbound))
   reference to undefined identifier: unbound
 
    === context ===
   stdin::1: f
 
   > ^D
 
 when run on his machine just produces this:
   > (define (f x) (+ (x)))
   > (f (lambda () unbound))
   reference to undefined identifier: unbound
   >
 
 (It is also 369.6, of a recent stripe).
 
 Any ideas?

 I don't think I got the actual flags but he did mention that the other
 builds he had done do not have any CFLAGS so probably there was
 something like that in there.

 Yes, the broken build is compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer, and the others are not.

 MzScheme can't provide stack traces when -fomit-frame-pointer is used
 and the JIT is enabled.
 
 This reminds me that x86_64 doesn't use frame pointers at all, so
 MzScheme currently provides no stack traces for x86_64 (when the JIT is
 used).

 Okay, so it looks like the right thing is for drscheme to just avoid
 that message if the stack is completely empty. I've committed that
 change.
