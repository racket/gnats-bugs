>Description:
When people add a new language to DrScheme, they specify the language's
position in the Language menu using drscheme-language-positions:

  (define drscheme-language-positions
    '(("Teaching Languages" "The Little LISPer")))

The problem is, defining the language's position that way by directly
using the string "Teaching Languages" (or "Experimental Languages") works
well only if the user is using English as his human language.  When
using another language like French, the user somehow ends up with both
the French *and* English sub-menu titles.

>How-To-Repeat:
Switch to French as the human language, then open the language
selection menu.

 Something funny is going on. I never saw this PR before, nor did I see
 Matthias's message.

 Yes, but we should probably make this way work.
 
 Matthew -- do you mind if the infotab.ss language provides
 `string-constant'?

 I didn't remember, but I left a comment at the top of version 1.14 of
 infotab.ss:
 
   ;; string-constants are commented out here and in the provides form below.
   ;; Adding that means that the core system depends on string-constants.  But
   ;; currently, it is used only for GUI -- if core level stuff goes in there,
   ;; this should be added back in.
   ;; (require (lib "string-constant.ss" "string-constants"))
 
 So the reason was trying to make the core mz system independent of
 string constants because it's not really used there...  Is this the
 only way to solve this bug?  Would it be possible to add a
 gui-infotab.ss to be shipped and used by collections that use string
 constants?

 That's one option, but I prefer to make infotab depend on string
 constants and limit the extra stuff (roughly, lets make distributions
 serve us, not us serve them).
 
 I'll move the PR back to you, Eli.

 Well, ever since I realized that people actually use the mz
 distribution, I was trying to be careful about including stuff that is
 not needed...  In any case, I don't think that there is an issue of us
 serving the distributions, but that there might be a better way to
 design the language placement specification.  (An indication that this
 could be better is the fact that these things happened in the first
 place -- it's probably due to people not thinking that they should
 have used string-constants in the first place.)
 
 Given that changing that will be difficult now, I think that the most
 sensible choice would be to add a gui-extended kind of info files --
 this will allow future extensions that will have more dependencies on
 mred, frameworks, drschem, etc.
 
 So the question is whether you insist on adding the string-constants
 to the mz...

 The PR is yours now. I insist on nothing :)
 
 If the only difference is string-constants or not, however, calling it
 GUI might be confusing.
