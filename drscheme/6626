>Description:
With a file that contains "(lambda (x)" as the first line, followed
by 1000 blank lines, followed by and "x" alone on a line repeated
10 times (for a total of 10,000 lines and 10 "x"s) followed by a
close paren (on the same line as the last "x") the paren matcher
doesn't identify the match properly. It colors the initial paren
red.

If I go to the last paren, however, it correctly colors the
buffer grey. Then, if I type alt-shift-left (to move backwards
to the matching paren) the initial paren is then colored properly.
