>Description:
Whenver a key is pressed on the number pad of my standard
102-key MS keyboard, the input is doubled.  I press 1 on
the keypad and 11 shows up on the screen - this is both in
the editor and execution window.  The same is true for the
+ - * and / symbols - double input.  The number row above
the letter rows do not double my input.

I'm part of a CS class at GA Tech.  There are about 3 other
people who have reported this same problem to our professor/TAs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme, place cursor in either the editor or execution window.  Push keys on the number pad!
