>Description:
I'm on Windows, with german keyboard layout. The setting "Automatically adjust opening square brackets" is activated in DrRacket's preference dialog. I expect that when I enter a "[", it is sometimes replaced by "(" and sometimes left as "[". Instead, it is always replaced by "[]".

I investigated, and I think that this is because in the german keyboard layout, I need to press

  shift-8 to get (
  shift-9 to get )
  meta-8 to get [
  and meta-9 to get ].

So I cannot press [ without pressing meta-[. But meta-[ is bound to insert a bracket pair. So with the standard keybindings, I cannot access the function bound to plain "[". The same problem may well apply to other keybindings.


I coped with this for years, training to use "[;del" in DrRacket instead of "[" to get rid of the closing bracket, and always wondering why DrRacket could not automatically adjust round and square brackets according to standard conventions ...


Finally, previous weekend, I decided to work around this problem by writing my own keybindings. Actually, with the german keyboard layout, parentheses are easier to input than brackets, so I figured that I want the automatic adjustment with parentheses. Unfortunately, Racket's support for automatic adjustment is hard-coded for brackets (it defaults to brackets inside string literals or comments), so I hacked together the following keybindings:
