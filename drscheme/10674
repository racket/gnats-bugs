>Description:
DrScheme, version 4.2.1

Under the menu item "Scheme", "Comment out with a box" and "Comment out with Semicolons" have both underlined "C" which means they have the same shortcut.
>How-To-Repeat:
Press "Alt+c" then "Alt+c" you get your selection commented out with a box. I wanted it to be commented out with semicoloms.
>Fix:
I moved the & over to the "b" in "box" for "comment out with a box".
>Release-Note:
This could have been a contract violation: make sure, when a menu item is added to a menu that the &'s all prefix different letters.

I don't think that the corresponding error (or a relevant one) could have been a type error.

Reason>>> This has been fixed in SVN. I'm not sure when it was fixed,
but if it wasn't in the last release, it will be in the next
one.

Thanks for the report.
