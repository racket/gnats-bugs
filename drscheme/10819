>Description:
When I attempt to close DrScheme with unsaved files open, I am presented with a warning dialog box.  It'd be nice to be able to hit y/n to save/dismiss.  I'm thinking of MS Word as an example.

Mathematica takes it one step further.  With a bunch of unsaved files open, the dialog offers the option to discard all changes in all files, also with the hit of only one key.
>How-To-Repeat:
Close an unsaved tab/file.  Tab and the arrows keys can navigate the dialog's choices, but having a letter-key key-stroke would be more convenient.
>Fix:
