>Description:
When a program is loaded into MrEd using -u -- -f, MrEd does not run 
the program in the main thread of the program's eventspace. After
inspecting the code, it appears that this bug also exists for 
programs loaded with -A, but I haven't tried to verify that case.

The cause of the bug is that system.ss creates a new eventspace
for the program, but it loads and invokes program using the main
thread of the original eventspace.

>How-To-Repeat:
Put this in a file:
 (send (make-object wx:frame% null "test") show #t)
 (semaphore-wait (make-semaphore 0))
and load it into MrEd using -u -- -f; the frame
can be closed, just as in PR 576.
