>Description:
Incorrect control/display of fractional values:
- can't select between mixed fractions & repeating-decimal prefernece.
- display of negative fractional values incorrect: -1/3 -> -1.66...
- would be nice to also have plain-old-ascii-mixed-fraction prefernece
  representation option to simplify text cut/past plain-old-text docs.
>How-To-Repeat:
- select language option mixed-fractions, enter -1/3, returns -1.6...
- as above, -1/3 =/= -1.6...
- on ocasion it would be nice to have an ascii improper and improper
  fractional display supported in lieu of the graphical fraction
  representation, as there are occasons when it would be nice to
  restrict the display to that which can be represented as a
  plain-old-text-line, (i.e. 123/13, or 9_2/13)

 Thanks for the report!

 I'm not sure what is going wrong here. Can you be a little more 
 specific on what you do, what happens and how that differs from your 
 expectations?
 
 
 >- display of negative fractional values incorrect: -1/3 -> -1.66...
 
 oops. I will fix that this week, after I return back to town.

 I'm not sure what you would like to do here. Does cut and paste not 
 work for you?
 
 Which language are you using? (the HtDP languages or the PLT languages?)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 - the repeating decimal form is displayed regardless of language settings.

 - maybe that's the real problem, it doesn't.

 - only difference between languages appears to be the display of #e prefix.

State-Changed-Why:
    points 1 and 2 have been fixed.
    
    for point 3, copy/paste should suffice. (pasting into
    a non-drscheme window yields a raw text version of
    the number)
