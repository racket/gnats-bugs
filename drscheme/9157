>Description:
The DrScheme "get guidance" dialog (when no language has been chosen) includes a link to "(module ...)" but when I click on it I get this error:

change-current-lang-to: unknown language! ("Legacy Languages" "(module ...)")

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The wrong spec was in there for the module langauge.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. It probably wouldn't have been a type error, since the datatype for describing a langauge in the language dialog probably wouldn't have been precise enough to rule out what it was (but it could have been and maybe it would have been wise to make it so).
