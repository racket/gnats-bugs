>Description:
it would be nice to show source-to-use symbol arrows for highligted items,
such that arrows do not disapear when scrolling to arrow source/destinations
for selected/highlighted symbols. (otherwise it's impossible to to see all
identified uses, for programs which extend beyond one visable page)

 Did you find the "tack"ing feature of the arrows? If you are at
 the binding location, tacking the arrows makes them stick around.

 If I understand you correctly, you can work around this pretty easily 
 by not moving the mouse, and instead using the keyboard to page up & 
 down.  That is:  put the mouse over the binding instance, then take 
 your hand off it and just use the PgUp & PgDown keys.
 
 Not so pretty, but it works pretty well for me.
