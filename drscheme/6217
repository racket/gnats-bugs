>Description:
When I enable profiling and click the Execute button, I get an
error like that below.

Welcome to DrScheme, version 203.7-cvs15apr2003.
Language: Textual (MzScheme, includes R5RS) custom.
errortrace: unrecognized (non-top-level) expression form:
((let ((g241 (#<procedure:register-profile-start>
'profile-point240))) (with-continuation-mark 'g14 'profile-point240
(begin letrec-values (((passed) (#%datum . 0)) ((failed)
(#%datum . 0)) ((test) (with-continuation-mark
'drscheme-debug-continuat...
> 
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following code in a DrScheme Definitions window and
click Execute:

(define (hi) (display "Hello, world!\n"))

Most any code will trigger the error, although it appears that
self-evaluating forms like string and integer literals generate
the error "cdr: expects argument of type <pair>;" when at top
level or as the sole body of a "lambda" form, which may be a
separate bug.

 This PR seems to have been fixed. Did one of you fix it?
 
 Thanks,

 Presumably it became fixed in the exp-tagged code when we reverted
 errortrace. But the bug would presuambly return if the variable-display
 code is restored.

 Ah. I thought we had pushed past that code. Sorry.
