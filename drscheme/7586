>Description:
I noticed that my order-manuals method is never called,
and started to investigate.  At the end of it, I found
that the code in collects/drscheme/private/help-desk.ss
has an `order-manuals' method (line ~66) which is called,
and that in turn calls the order-manuals method of the
current language setting.  I've added prints to all
relevant definitions of order-manuals, and didn't see
any output -- it looks like the method call is getting
lost somewhere.  Printing the object where help-desk.ss
sends the order-manuals message to shows that it is a
wrapper-object, so maybe there's a bug there?

 FWIW, the bug is unlikely to be there. I'll try to look into this  
 after going to Estonia. ...

 In any case, I have tried planting printf's all over the place, and
 the only one that was actually used was before the message is sent in
 help-desk.ss -- seems like it just gets lots somewhere, which is why
 I'm not sure that it's in drscheme/frameworks/help.

 I just added this:
 
           (define/override (order-manuals x)
             (printf "swindle order manuals ~s\n" x)
             (super order-manuals x))
 
 starting at line 38 in plt/collects/swindle/tool.ss, start a new
 drscheme, hit f1, type something into the search bar, hit return and
 then see:
 
 swindle order manuals (#"help" #"r5rs" #"mzscheme" #"mred" #"beginning" #"beginning-abbr" #"intermediate" #"intermediate-lambda" #"advanced" #"teachpack" #"profj-beginner" #"profj-intermediate" #"profj-advanced" #"tour" #"drscheme" #"srfi" #"mzlib" #"misclib" #"mrlib" #"framework" #"mzc" #"foreign" #"tools" #"insidemz" #"swindle" #"plot" #"web-server" #"t-y-scheme" #"tex2page")

 Maybe what you're missing is that the method order-manuals on line 318
 of gui.ss (in the help collection) is overridden by the one on line 66
 in help-desk.ss in the drscheme collection, by way of a dynamically
 registered mixin. 
 
 In any case, that method seems to be being called, which then delegates
 to the language and I see the printouts as above.

 Hmm....  Actually, I didn't try that with swindle, but with my
 course's thing -- can you try to look at the code?  It's at
   http://csu660.barzilay.org/csu660.plt

 I saw that it reaches that line -- but that function sends an
 `order-manuals' to a language object and that's the call that I don't
 see anyone handling.

 So .. what is the bug exactly? Do you have a small example? I can't
 really look at the course thing now ... sorry :(

 Well, it boils down to adding an order-manuals method at a similar
 place to the swindle/tool.ss that you used, and it is never used.
 More than that, I don't see anything else being used after
 help-desk.ss:66.  I've put the relevant file in
 
   http://tmp.barzilay.org/langs.ss
 
 You can see the method definition there.
