>Description:
A "Standard Output" window, reporting the line
    load-file in text%: not a MrEd editor<%> file
once for each time I reverted, and a busy cursor (the hourglass in Windows) occurs when I follow the procedure outlined below.  The busy cursor is semi-erroneous: I can still use the menu and buttons, but the definitions and interactions windows are locked up.  To get them back, I must stop and restart Dr. Scheme (v.201 - Windows).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a file
2. Enable profiling [I use R5RS language level]
3. Click "Execute"
4. Click File->Revert [I prefer to edit in emacs]
5. Click "Yes" to "Are you sure..."
6. Go to Step 4 for more copies of the "load-file..." line
