>Description:
On startup of DrScheme, I get a stdout window with the error message "procedure icons-bitmap: expects 1 argument, given 2: #<struct:class:bitmap%> \"recycle.gif\""
It doesn't seem to cause any other problems, but it's distracting.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
this was an arity error; there was extra junk at a callsite. removed that extra junk.
>Release-Note:
this was a contract violation. It would have been a type error, too.
