>Description:
DrScheme's Beginner language redefines some of the built-in arithmetic
primitives to be non-unary.  This seems to lead to some inconsistencies.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the Beginner REPL:
  (+ 1)
  (+ 1 'foo)
The second message has an extra "procedure" at the beginning.  In neither
case is the + in the error message a link.

For the expressions
  (* 1)
  (* 1 'foo)
there is no link to * in the first error message, but there is one in
the second error.

/ behaves the same as *.
