That's the error I'm getting; I don't really know why its happening. It only works for some programs and not for others. I use the same source code on another computer and it works fine. Even the same configuration files.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Wed, 27 Dec 2006 15:07:03 -0500
Reason>>> Robby -- I'm moving it to you, in case it rings a bell.  If 
it doesn't, then I think it should be changed to feedback 
and put on hold until further information is given.
Jack -- it would be really helpful if you can find a way to 
reproduce this problem.

 Jack -- it seems that nobody can reproduce this problem, if you can
 find a way to reproduce it we can investigate more.  I'll close it for
 now, and reopen if you do send more information.

 No clue, sorry.
 
 Can you make this someone else's PR?
