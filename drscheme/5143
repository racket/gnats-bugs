 I've been seeing these messages before, but never with a reproducible
 error. But, with this PR you submitted, the error message I get is:
 
    error trying to display error: exception raised: explode-path: input was not in normal form: "USERPORT".so
 
 with a funny ".so" at the end. Any idea where that comes from? Have you
 seen that?

 No, I haven't seen that. I'll try in Unix tomorrow.

Responsible-Changed-When: Tue Jan  8 18:56:00 2002
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    all that remains is the bad error message from
    
    
    `find-relative-path'. 
    
    
    
    
    
    matthew, if you aren't planning to fix that, I can close
    
    
    this. Let me know.
    
    
    
    
    
    If better contract specs had existed, this would have
    
    
    saved me lots of time. There are no source
    
    
    locations for this bug (it was in drscheme's
    
    
    default exceeption handler which, by nature,
    
    
    doesn't get source locations) so I had to
    
    
    go by the error message, which was reporting
    
    
    the wrong function had failed.

    a while ago.
