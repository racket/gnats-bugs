>Description:
The DrScheme meta-information contains a `(modname <symbol>)' in it.
This assumes a single filename for each file, which means that it
hard-wires a single name when the file has several names (links) with
different names.  (Which happens to be something I use in my course...)

It would be better to make the reader compute the module name when the
file is read.

 If you can.  But I think that you might get some bogus name from the
 last mixin so perhaps you'll need to propagate that information as the
 currently-active-input-file.
 
 
 > Would making the modname optional be a good idea?
 
 I don't see any case where you want it hard-wired in the file...
 (You need some default name anyway when the file is not saved, right?)

 How should the reader compute it? Look at the name of the port?
 
 Would making the modname optional be a good idea?

 Loading old files is the only thing.
 
 I'm not sure I'll be able to get to this soon, so if you have time .....

 Happy new year!
 
 If the file isn't saved, you can't read it off the disk...? (execute
 doesn't use that stuff, I think, but I might be misremembering)

 I'll try to get it, but most definitely not today.  (It's the Jewish
 new year thing.)

 Isn't the whole meta thing created when you edit the file, before it
 is saved?
