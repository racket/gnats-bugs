	Same experience as before

	If you think about it, append! or append can't matter because 
	it worked at R4RS but not at Intermediate

State-Changed-Why:

It was append. It is not released. Sorry for the confusion.

In fact the different language levels is exactly what led me to the bug.
Since dotted pairs are allowed at r4rs, the check is skipped at that
language level (you just get the raw primitive); the checking code was
looping.  (It was a naming problem, I was calling the redefined-primitive
after the check succeeded, insetad of calling the primitive)
