>Description:
It would be nice to have syntax highlighted at all times, not just when you tell DrScheme to.
Makes editing a bit more pleasing on the eye, I guess.
It doesn't have to do the bindings (which is probably what takes the most time), just the coloring would be fine...  please? =)

State-Changed-Why:
    Sadly, the syntax coloring is based on being able to
    expand the program (not, like emacs on some approximate
    regular expressions). We don't know how to do expansion
    of partial programs, and I don't see us going to some approximate
    method (too much overhead, not much return) so I'm afraid
    that we're kind of stuck in the situation we're in, for now.
    
    I wish that we could do better, myself!

    fixed and released (to CVS) will be out in v206. 
    
    Thanks for Scott Owens!
