 When I start up DrRacket (under windows 7) and then do "file | save",
 it puts the files in the directory I most recently used. Then, when I
 exit DrRacket and restart it and do "file | open", it shows me the
 same directory.
 
 I guess you're seeing something different? Can you say more how?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Oh, I see. Hm. Interesting thought. I've re-added the cc list so
 others can see this idea too.
 
 I don't think that this is really something that will be hashed out
 via a PR, however, since it is a pretty fundamental change to the way
 things work in Racket (unless someone sees some way to make this fit
 in more easily) so you may wish to move this discussion to the racket
 user mailing list.

Reason>>> 
This is not something that really works well with the way
the Racket language is designed.

There may be a way to get something that is just as useful
to you, however. I suggest consulting the mailing list with
some more detail. They may be able to help.
