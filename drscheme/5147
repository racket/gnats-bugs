>Description:
A malformed 'bound-in-source property can put a
DrScheme editor into a bad state where it doesn't update
(looks an unbalanced begin-edit-sequence).

>How-To-Repeat:
Check-Syntax the following program in the MzScheme language: 

(define-syntax (s stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(_ x y)
     (syntax-property
      (syntax 10)
      'bound-in-source
      (cons (syntax-local-introduce (syntax x))
            (syntax-local-introduce (syntax y))))]))

Responsible-Changed-From-To: steck->robby
Responsible-Changed-By: robby
Responsible-Changed-When: Wed Jan  9 11:40:38 2002
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    technically not check syntax, but that's the best
    we can do without a proper contract on
    syntax properties
State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: robby
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 10 00:08:53 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    check syntax just ignores those
    properties now. 
    
    errors should probably have been signalled earlier
    in the pipeline, anyway.
