>Description:
Macos X (10.2.8), Dr Scheme v.205
I lose the execute, break, save etc buttons from
my window. The menu shortcuts still work 
(if I can remember them). Restart (plus reboot of 
Macos X does NOT clear the fault. Last time it
happened the fault cleared with no apparent action
after a day or so.
Experienced Dr Scheme users I have asked say no
idea what I have done, must be a bug!! Never seen
it happen before.

 Click the wide button on the top right of the drscheme window (you may
 find this useful in other apps, too).
 
 There is a bug in v205 where iconifying the window implicitly clicks
 this button for you. It's been fixed since, but we haven't had a
 release yet.

 PS: windows is the OS where rebooting fixes things ;)
