>Description:
Trying to start the game 'Paint By Numbers' from the
'Choose a game'-Window by pressing the corresponding
butten results in an error message and some
(for me obscure) output in the Standard Output window:

class*: superclass already includes public ivar: get-filename in superclass: derived from frame% for class: generic-frame%
  (#%class*/names (this super-init) (fw... in c:\drscheme\plt\.\collects\setup\..\..\collects\games\paint-by-numbers\main.ss

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Choose HelpDesk
Choose Scheme
Choose PLT-Software
Click games
Press Button Paint By Numbers
-- there is it!!!
