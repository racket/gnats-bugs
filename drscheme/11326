>Description:
In a student language with test cases, I see the message
"The test passed!" not just on initial evaluation, but 
after *every* interactions window evaluation.

I suppose this might perhaps be deliberate, but I'd be 
surprised...
>How-To-Repeat:
Change to Beginning student language
Open a new window
Type (check-expect 3 3)
Run
In the interactions window, see "The test passed!" (as 
  expected)
In the interactions window, evaluate "3".
See "3"... and also, "The test passed!"
Every subsequent interactions window interaction 
  causes the repeat of this message.

 Mike: I think this is because the call I inserted into the test
 library is the wrong one (or maybe we need a new one). It looks like
 we need something that only brings the test window to the front when
 there is new stuff to show in the window and only shows that message
 when there are new test cases.
 
 Is this something you'll look into or shall I?

Responsible changed from "matthias" to "robby" by matthias at Wed, 27 Oct 2010 09:56:03 -0400
Reason>>> robby does drscheme


State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 28 Oct 2010 10:51:07 -0400
Reason>>> fix a (short) while back
