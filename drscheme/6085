>Description:
If I save a file called a.work.scm, then the backup copy created by DrScheme should be called a.work.bak.

Instead it is called a.bak.

I.e. to derive the backup filename DrScheme should strip off the text after the LAST period, not the first period.

I flagged it as serious because I guess that this may affect the ability of the user or of DrScheme to retore work from a backup.

Best, Mark
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
used a more sophisticated function to do just what he asked.
>Release-Note:
there could have been a dependent contract, I suppose, saying
that the result has the same number of periods in it as the
input.
