>Description:
Hello:

   Dr. Scheme is no doubt the best I used so far, better than MIT Scheme.
I was doing some graphics on my IBM clone running win98.

   (define (v)
     (open-graphics)
     (let ((x (open-viewport "view" 400 400 1))
	   (p (make-posn 200 200))
	   (c (make-rgb 0 0 1)))
       ((draw-viewport x) c)
       ...other lines...

  (arity (draw-viewport x)) returns 0; and the function does not take any color arguments and it said it expected 0 arguments.

   I wonder if you could help me solve this bug.

   Thank you very much.

   Sincerely,

   Rong Shen

Fixed. In the next release, draw-viewport will take an additional parameter 
specifing the color to fill the viewport with. Test suite extended.
