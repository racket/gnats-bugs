>Description:
When using DrRacket I can do the following:
- select text in DrRacket using the mouse and then middle-click with the mouse in an xterm to paste the selected text
- select text in an xterm using the mouse and then middle-click with the mouse in DrRacket to paste the selected text
(in fact the xterm can be replaced by another X-Windows application: Firefox, xedit, ...)

What I cannot do is select text in DrRacket using the mouse and middle-click with the mouse in DrRacket to paste the selected text. To make this work I have to explicitely copy-paste using Ctrl-c + Ctrl-v or DrRacket's copy-paste menu entries.

In short it looks like DrRacket has its own separate copy-paste buffer which is different from the one used by all the other X-Windows applications.

This is strange because then I can do the following:
- use the mouse to select some text "abc" in DrRacket
- middle-click the mouse to paste "abc" in an xterm 
- do Ctrl-c in DrRacket to copy "abc"
- select some other text "def" in DrRacket
- paste "def" in an xterm
- do Ctrl-v in DrRacket which will then paste the old text "abc"
I.e. I arrive at a situation where pasting in an xterm by middle-clicking pastes some text which is different from what I get when pasting in DrRacket using Ctrl-v.
