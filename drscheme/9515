>Description:
Copy and pasting between files when the syntax checker is running will cause the syntax checker to crash
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Open Dr. Scheme with two tabs, with a relatively complicated file in one tab (so that check-syntax takes a while).
2) Press Check Syntax
3) Select and copy some code 
4) Switch tabs
5) Paste code

If you manage to complete step 5 before the check is done, then
the following error occurs, your paste goes to stdout, and the good doctor is ill.

hash-ref: expects type <hash> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: #<object:...engine/test-tool.scm:30:6> #<procedure:...heme/syncheck.ss:441:35>

>Fix:
Check Syntax was saving the value of the frame instead of the value of the editor when traversing the syntax objects, so if you changed the current tab, it would get the wrong definitions text ... (bad!)
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. It would not have been a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 21 Jun 2008 10:56:06 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks!
