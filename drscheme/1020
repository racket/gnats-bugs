>Description:
If I ask drscheme to evaluate an undefined variable that starts with an
asterisk or a question mark, the window freezes up.  

More precisely, I start up drscheme (with mzscheme debug, or beginner, 
as the language).  I type,
for example, 
	*hell 
at the prompt in the interaction window, and press return.  
After a long pause I get one or two copies of the line
  "reference to undefined identifier: *hell" 
and no response to any input.  I also get two copies of the message
  regexp: ?+* follows nothing
on standard output.

The "execute" and "check syntax" buttons are grayed-out.  Clicking on 
"break" rewards me with a dialog asking if I want to "break" or "kill".
After pressing one of these the break button is now inactive, and there is still no
still no response to any input.  The close button on the window still 
works, which is a small blessing
>How-To-Repeat:
Type an undefined name starting with * or ? in the interaction window
and press return.  And wait...
