>Description:
Often I join two lines by (forward-)deleting
the CR at the end of the first line.
Almost always, i'm then stuck manually
deleting all the white-space that was
leading the second line.

If the second line is non-blank,
is it reasonable to trim away any
leading whitespace on the second line?


Usually this is when revising code,
(a) combining cond branches onto a single line, or
(b) gathering function args onto a single line
    (often because i've reduced the #args required by that function.)


[no reply needed]

[ps Despite all my bug-reports, i'm
really excited about v200 -- very nice!]

>How-To-Repeat:

      [other-test
       (some-func arg1
                  arg2)])

 Have you tried the meta-space key combo? Try it just after deleting the
 newline.

 Have you ever used the "meta-space" (or "ESC-<space>") binding?  It's 
 similar but slightly more useful than the same binding in emacs. 
 Basically, whenever you have whitespace (including newlines) to 
 eliminate, just keep hitting meta-space until you reach a fixpoint. 
 Robby showed me this.
