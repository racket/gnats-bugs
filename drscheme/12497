>Description:
When DrRacket starts in the initial "no language chosen" state, the OK button in the language dialog stays greyed out even when a language is selected. However, clicking on the "disabled" OK button works (ie, switches to the selected language).

This might be related to PR 12496.
>How-To-Repeat:
Move ~/.racket/racket-prefs.rktd out of the way so that DrRacket will start without a default language set.

Open the language dialog (do not click "Get Guidance").

Clicking on the "Choose a language" radio button selection causes the "Beginning Student" language to be selected, but the radio button is not checked, and the OK button is still greyed out. But clicking on the OK button works!

Also, the keyboard shortcuts (ctl-C, ctl-U) listed by the radio button selections don't cause the corresponding radio buttons to become checked either.
