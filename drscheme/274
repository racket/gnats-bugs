Subject: DrScheme Bug.
Date: Fri, 29 Aug 1997 17:29:52 -0700

DrScheme "Select File" dialog does not have appropriate file extension
available in "Save as type" combo box.

This may seem trivial but it's what I would call a usability bug.

Standard file dialog idiom requires that the "Save as type" combo box
default to a file extension appropriate to your application. In the case
of DrScheme, it should default to ".ss ".  DrScheme doesn't even provide
this as an option! 

The standard behavior is that when a user types a file name without an
extension, the dialog automatically appends the default extension onto
the file name when it saves it. This prevents the careless or
unexperienced user from putting the wrong extension on a file, or in my
case no extension at all. 

If the user would like a different extension, they can select the
desired extension from the combo box, or type the extension they want.

If the user wants no extension, they would select "Files (*.*)" from the
combo box and then type the filename etc.

Case in point: When I first went to save a file, I assumed the standard
idiom and simply typed the filename I wanted. This of course saved the
file without an extension. When I later went to open the file, DrScheme
opened it in an entirely separate window and I was at a loss as to how
to get the dang thing into my interactions buffer. After visiting all
the pull-downs, I finally resorted to cutting a pasting (really). It
hadn't occured to me that DrScheme opened the other window because the
file had the wrong extension. You're probably wondering, why wasn't it
obvious that the files had the wrong extension, after all, the dialog
displays the filename. True, but many apps hide file extensions, except
for the ones they don't recognize, more anoying, your app doesn't supply
the correct extension as an option! How the hell am I supposed to know
what extension to use? How the hell am I supposed to know that files
with one extension get opened in one window, while files with another
extension get opened in a different window? Here's the help the doc
provided:

*Open... will bring up a dialog box from which you choose a file. The
file you choose will be loaded into the program buffer. You will be
warned if the current program buffer contents are not saved. In the
dialog box, highlight a file and choose OK. To switch to a subdirectory,
highlight the subdirectory and choose OK. To switch to a containing
directory press the button above the file list and choose a directory.
To switch to an arbitrary directory type the directory in the little
window along the bottom of the dialog, and press return.

Here it should mention that files with extensions other than ".ss" will
be opened in a separate window.

 This is the problem we saw during the workshop. Having an option to
 open all files like .ss files doesn't much solve the problem if it's
 off by default. wx:file-selector does take arguments to set the list
 of suffixes and the default suffix.

 ... but the option seems to be ON by default. Perhaps he was using
 version 49?

 Is this new? I must have missed it the first time around.

 Can we add a version number field to the online form?

 This is old. I think I mentioned it in my last mail on the subject
 (the list of problems from the workshop).
 
 I didn't push for using this before since it doesn't do anything under
 X Windows and MacOS (and we had a completely portable problem :).  But
 our user makes a good case that it should at least work under Windows.

 I take it you want to know what version I am using?
 
 Where would I find that? Normally I would pulldown help-->about....
 Oh here we go, It seems I had an extra doc directory ie
 plt\doc\doc\(files) instead of plt\doc\(files). Anyway, after rearanging
 my files, I clicked help and the version is indeed version 49:
 (incidently, the edit menue copy command in the help window I got,
 doesn't) so I'll type:
 PLT
 Rice University
 Houston, TX
 
 Version 49
 May 1997
 
 etc.
