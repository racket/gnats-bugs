>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
get-ids is a function that abstracts over the type of mapping being used for identifiers (it dates to a time when I wasn't sure what mapping should be used for identifiers). I had forgotten about it when I made some recent changes to check syntax so had used the raw accessor. Then I remembered and changed the code to use the wrapper, but it has a different signature and I didn't change the call site to use the new signature
>Release-Note:
This was a type error. It was also a contract error.
