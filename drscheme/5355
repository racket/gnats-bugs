>Description:
When you select "Erzeuge EXE..." you will be asked for
the filename of the file to generate and thereafter the
following error will occur:
format: format string requires 2 arguments, given 1; arguments were: "D\374rfen wir Ihr Programm in die ausf\374hrba... "i386-linux"

>How-To-Repeat:
Just do "Erzeuge EXE..." with any program in drscheme
>Fix:

>Release-Note:
This is a contract violation, of a sort. The error reporting
isn't good, tho. The problem is that the format modifiers
in the german string constants and the format modifiers
in the english string constants do not match up.
