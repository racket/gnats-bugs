>Description:
when a file contains a module whose name does not match the 
file's, and that file is required by another, the error message
says that the file "does not contain a module as expected".  Is 
there any chance that the error message could be changed to one
that indicates that the names don't match?

Note: this is only true of the load-handler in DrScheme.
MzScheme's default-load-handler gives a more explicit
error message.

foo.ss:
(module bar mzscheme)

 This appears to be a problem with `check-module-form'. Is MzScheme not
 using that procedure?

 No, MzScheme uses its own versions.

 It's a initialization/bootstrapping/interoperability problem.

 This is one thing that I think Scheme48 does better than us with it's
 module system. Perhaps, one day, it might be worth looking at their
 architecture to see if we can get some of that benefit?
