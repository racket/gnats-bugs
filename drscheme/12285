 For now, set the language to Pretty Big instead of changing the mode
 (or in addition maybe).
 
 I don't really like the interaction between the modes and the module
 language and modes. I think that there shouldn't be an option to use
 any mode other than the module language mode when you're in the module
 language, at least conceptually. I can see how that could be painful
 with the current set of GUI controls and what they actually control at
 the moment, tho.
 
 So, GUI improvement suggestions are welcome, but I'm not excited about
 the prospect of following the "obvious" suggestion behind the PR and
 making text mode + module language be a viable combination.
