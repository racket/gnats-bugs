>Description:
When I create a new window in the Module language, the buffer contains 
only a newline, rather than '#lang scheme'.  The interactions window
(AFAICT) automatically runs this, and produces this error:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.4.3-svn22feb2009 [3m].
Language: Module custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
Module Language: There must be a valid module in the
definitions window.  Try starting your program with

  #lang scheme

and clicking ‘Run’.

Interactions disabled.

This goes away if I axe my preferences file.  I'll attach my preferences 
file to the bug report.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrScheme with prefs file, see this error.

 DO you know how you got into that state? (I've gotten into it too, but
 I don't know how I did.)
