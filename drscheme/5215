>Description:
If you try to browse a module that doesn't compile correctly, you
get a window that stays around forever.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create the module:

(module foo mzscheme
  x)

then use the module browser on it.
I get a (correct) error message, followed by a "module overview progress"
window that doesn't want to go away (no menus to close it, doesn't respond
to keyboard shortcuts).
