>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrRacket
Click on Help in the menu bar

Responsible changed from "robby" to "eli" by eli at Sat, 19 Feb 2011 16:22:17 -0500
Reason>>> I've checked this.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sat, 19 Feb 2011 16:22:17 -0500
Reason>>> I see the menu entry fine -- there might be some problem 
with your setup but since there is no usable email it's 
impossible to ask for such feedback.
