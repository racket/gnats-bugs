This brings up a keyword error.
Click on the hyperlink ("keyword").
The Help Desk page gives the right error message,
  but it's followed by a link to
  "Advanced Student Table of Contents",
   which is inappropriate given the user's language level.

 I think that the only fix to this is to augment the r5, mz, and mr docs
 with each of the zodiac keywords. The zodiac keywords are listed in
 zodiac's doc.txt file. DrScheme already searches in the (what seems to
 be) the proper order:
 
   help (help desk manual itself)
   drscheme
   r5rs
   mzscheme
   mred
   ...etc
 
 when one is in a "full scheme" language level.
