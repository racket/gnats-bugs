>Description:
For some odd reason sqrt2 binds to old sqrt-iter
    function.  This obviously should not be
    happening.  Here is the sample file needed to
    reproduce the error:
-------------------------
;;; (page 25, SICP)

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

(define (new-if2 predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond ((force predicate) (force then-clause))
        (else (force else-clause))))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))

;;; Answer: because new-if is *not* a special form, but a regular function,
;;; all its arguments have to be evaluated every time.  This means that there
;;; is never a chance to break out of a loop, because the 3rd argument to
;;; new-if is evaluated over and over again.  The 3rd argument is evaluated
;;; even if the predicate is #t!  Note: if Scheme used lazy evaluation by
;;; default, the new-if function would have worked!

(define (sqrt2 guess x)
  (new-if2 (delay (good-enough? guess x))
          (delay guess)
          (delay (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                            x))))

;;; There is an odd bug which prevents from defining sqrt-it2 function.
;;; For some reason it keeps pointing to sqrt-iter!
>How-To-Repeat:
1. load the file I provided.
2. try to evaluate (sqrt2 1.0 2).  It should
evaluate correctly, but it doesn't, because it
evaluates sqrt-iter instead.  If you change
sqrt-iter to use lazy evaluation and new-if2
it will work as expected.

 You get an infinite loop in that case.  But you haven't 
 identified a DrScheme bug, merely a problem with your 
 algorithm, as far as I can tell.  Does this program run 
 differently on other Schemes?

 You're right!  The problem is that I made a simple
 typo in sqrt2 function: I called sqrt-iter from sqrt2
 (while I meant to call sqrt2, obviously).
 
 The code ran just fine once I corrected my own bug.
 I'll be more careful next time.  Thanks :).
 
 The lazy version works just fine, so there is no
 problem with my algorithm.  I did make a very stupid
 mistake though, and I feel silly that I actually
 submitted it as a bug report.
