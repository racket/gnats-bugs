Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme\n" #t))
>Description:
Enter the code, click run, open the stacktrace dialog, then close it.  The
focus is now not in either the definitions or interactions window.  For,
example, using Ctrl+PgDown won't switch tabs.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(car 'foo)
>Fix:
Just set the focus to the containing editor when the click happens.

Also, the code for handling buttonness of those little icons was just broken all over the place.
>Release-Note:
I didn't see a type error or a contract error here. Just poor mouse handling.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Tue, 25 Aug 2009 00:55:59 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to svn.
