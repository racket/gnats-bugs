>Description:
I wish there were a way to mark a tabbed window as read-only, at least temporarily.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm grading homeworks.  I have all my database routines in a module db.ss.  My grading.ss looks like this:

(module grading mzscheme
  (require "db.ss")
  (connect)
  '(student-work "F07" "CPTR 125" handle "HW" 1)
  '(submit-student-work "F07" "CPTR 125" student-handle type number submitted)
  '(grade-student-work "F07" "CPTR 125" handle "HW" 1 timestamp grade)
  '(work-submitted-for-assignment "F07" "CPTR 125" "HW" 1)
  '(ungraded-student-work "F07" "CPTR 125" "HW" 1)
  )

What I like to do is grab some of those quoted forms using DivaScheme, copy them into the REPL, and edit them appropriately.  Unfortunately, from time to time I make DivaScheme keystroke errors (I'm still getting used to it), which changes grading.ss, and then my REPL gets the yellow warning telling me that my source has changed.  Yes, I can and do use undo.  However, I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if I could do what I do in Emacs, namely C-x C-q, to toggle the read-only status of the buffer (tabbed window)?"
