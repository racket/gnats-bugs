>Description:
I was testing the XonX version and changed my font, then I installed the native OS X version, but when I go to Preferences, I get the following error message:
"set-string-selection in list-control<%>: no item matching the given string: " Monospace""
and the Preference pane will not display at all. I suppose I'll have to delete my preferences file or find the offending line and remove it.

>Release-Note:
This is a contract violation error message.
