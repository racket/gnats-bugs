State-Changed-Why:
I changed SIXlib to raise an exception when it can't allocate the
viewport's pixmap.

The somewhat more general problem is that errors in GUI callbacks
within SIXlib don't get reported nicely. Fixed, too, even though there
should never be an error in that eventspace unless SIXlib is buggy in
some other way.
