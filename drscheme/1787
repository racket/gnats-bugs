If time is between noon/midnight and 1am/1pm,
it should render the hour as "00" rather than "0".
Arguably so for hours from 1 to 10 also.

 This bug report is incomplete! The program that you does not evaluate 
 the way your output shows!
 
 Please be more careful with this in the future.

 Okay. So the date library does use two digit dates when you are in 24 
 hour time. But, when in 12 hour time, it does not add the leading 
 zero. The default date display format is 'american, which does not 
 have 24 hour time.
