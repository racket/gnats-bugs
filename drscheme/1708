I'm required to load a teachpack for assignments but the set teachpack
option isn't there at all I've tried to download 101, 102, and 103
but to no avail.  In order to complete my assignments I need to 
open and utilize this teachpack.

 In 103, The "Language" menu should have an "Add Teachpack" menu entry in it.
 If it doesn't, perhaps you can send me a list of what it does have
 and that will help me figure out what's going wrong.
 
 Hope that helps,
 
 Robby

 The teachpack that I need to use isn't compatable with the add teachpack
 feature, when I use the add teachpack feature with the library I need to
 use it gives me an error message.  When I use dr scheme 101 at the school
 labs (they have the set teachpack feature on them) it works just fine.
 The versions I downloaded 101, 102, and 103, none of them contain the set
 teachpack feature.  My guess is that whoever wrote the library I need to
 use designed it to use only that particular feature.
 
 Sincerely,
 Brian Mason

 There should be no difference between the "Add teachpack" feature and the
 "set teachpack" feature, in terms of the teachpacks accepted. The only
 difference is that "Add teachpack" lets you have multiple teachpacks set
 and "set teachpack" only lets you have a single teachpack. 
 
 So, I suspect that the problem is with the teachpack itself. If you can
 email the teachpack to m, I can take a look at it and maybe suggest
 something.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
