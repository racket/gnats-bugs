>Description:
I've encountered an issue where DrRacket becomes unresponsive after I open and close several saved files.I have been following along with the systematic program design course on Coursera. After opening and closing 2-3 of the example files provided, DrRacket freezes and I have to force close and reopen the program to continue working.

System is Windows 8 Pro x64
>How-To-Repeat:
I simply have to open and close 2-3 saved files and the program stops responding. 
>Fix:
