>Description:
So here I am in class.  I showed everyone how neat DrScheme was.  We computed (expt 15 100000) just fine.  Then I went for (expt 15 1000000), but it took a lot longer.  I hit Ctrl-C.  Many times.  I pressed the stop button.  Many times.  DrScheme just wanted to make me happy with my original request, and eventually gave me the answer to (expt 15 1000000), but ignored my Ctrl-Cs and Stop button pushes.  Gee.

I also want the students to see how to submit a bug report.  Have a nice day!

 Robby: The Most of the work would be in converting and printing the
 answer in decimal. I think there may already be a PR along the lines
 that you can't interrupt DrScheme when it's busy printing something.

 I'm not sure I'm really solving your underlying problem, but you  
 might be interested to know that the problem here has nothing to do  
 with computing the number, or even in turning it into a string:
 
  > (define a  (time (expt 15 1000000)))
 cpu time: 1358 real time: 1369 gc time: 0
  > (define a  (time (number->string (expt 15 1000000))))
 cpu time: 9035 real time: 9107 gc time: 0
 
 You'll also notice that the break button works fine for all of this  
 (though I see no evidence that ctrl-c does anything at all).
 
 Instead, the problem is simply in printing the number out.
 
 It turns out to contain
 
  > (/ (/ (log (expt 15 1000000)) (log 10)) 80)
 14701.140738196016
 
 about 15,000 lines of digits.
 
 It would still be nice if you could hit the break button during this  
 operation, though.

 Thanks for the explanation!  The students were very impressed with  
 DrScheme's computational abilities (especially the math majors).
