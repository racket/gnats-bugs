>Description:
When trying to load an image into a buffer through the copy-and-paste mechanism, I see that the transparent gif I load is not transparent.

>How-To-Repeat:
Open a browser to: http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~kfisler/PBD/2011/Labs/soccer-goalie.html.  Do a "Copy" on the goalie image.  Open DrRacket.  Do a paste into the buffer.  A goalie image appears in DrRacket with a black background.  The resulting image snip is non-transparent.
>Fix:
