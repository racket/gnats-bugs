>Description:
when existing file was displayed, "new..." when selecting "clear current"
from popup, results in error:
  regexp-match: expects type <string or input-port> as 2nd argument,
  given: #f; other arguments were: #rx"\\.txt$"
>How-To-Repeat:
- start DrScheme
- select "open recent" file
- select "new ..."
- select "clear current"
- see error

(actually it might be nice to replace the "open here..."
 with generic "open..." and have the popup selection for
 "new-window/clear-currect" for new, open, and open recent.)

(also laslty, sorry a being a little lazy, noticed that the
 current framework docs are missing pages ~750-999.)
