>Description:
Hi im doing my third year project on implementing a scheme compiler.  It has to be in for the end of the month.  I didn't know how to program in Scheme so I am teaching myself through a book but the examples in it dont seem to work.  The compiler doesn't recognise lists which are a fairly important part of Scheme.  I can't continue with the book as lists will probably be in every chapter.  I hope you can help.

Below is the version of scheme I am using and the errors I get when I type the code below in.

 You are not using the right language. See the language menu. I can't
 recall what the options are, since you're using a very old version of
 DrScheme. You should also get the latest release, available from
 www.drscheme.org.
