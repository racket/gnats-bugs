>Description:
when a new version of DrScheme is first run, a language configuration
dialog box is presented, which is centered on the screen; if it is
expanded to show more detailed language options, it expands to the
right and down, where on my 768x1024 display it extends off the screen,
as opposed to remaining centered (or being nudged up and left, to
prevent the lower and right edges being drawn off screen).

[don't know if centered is display property, if so, wonder if framework
 should inforce it, and/or try to keep window within screen bounds, when
 it's expanded to be larger automatically?]
>How-To-Repeat:
- run new version of DrScheme.
- exand language configuration dialog box.
- see it expand off screen on smaller displays.
>Fix:
Added calls to `center' in the dialog.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation.

 I guess this is something where I call the `center' method in the
 show-details button callback?

 Yes, that should work.
