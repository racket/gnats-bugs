>Description:
After running a program, DrScheme colors the code in such a way as to highlight which blocks of code have never been tested.
There should be an option to toggle this function on and off, and more importantly these colors should be customizable via the options menu, in addition to the options for coloring symbol, keyword, background, etc.
