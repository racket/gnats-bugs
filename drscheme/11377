>Description:
I've been using Racket for a few days with no problems, reading the Guide and taking notes on a long one-line comment (I am just starting to learn the language). Today Racket crashed soon after starting, it did this several times even after dividing the long comment to a few lines, then blanked the source file. The backup file only contained only a few words and had not been saved for days.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try making a really long comment on one line.  That may have had something to do with it.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 24 Jan 2011 16:13:53 -0500
Reason>>> 

I created a file with only one line that was 131072
characters long. This caused DrRacket to work very hard, but
it did not crash so I'm going to close this report.

Thanks for sharing your experiences with us.
