>Description:
Here's an explanation of the code that breaks.
I want to create a function that invokes a thunk and
restarts that thunk when a break occurs.  with-handlers
does not work (according to the docs) because the right
hand side of the handler isn't protected from breaks.
The current-exception handler must not return and can not invoke full continuations, so it invokes an escaping
continuation.  In order for the code after the escaping
continuation to not break, the handler disables breaks
until a new handler is set up.  (The old handler can not
be re-used since it calls an escaping continuation, which can only be invoked once.)

Here's the problem that occurs.  It works like I expect
in mzscheme and mred.  Breaks cause the program to
print Break! and Unbreak and then continue.  In DrScheme, even in the mzscheme language without debugging, prints in red

  uncaught exception: #f

which is strange.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define t
  (thread (lambda ()
            (let ([parent-exn-handler (current-exception-handler)]
                  [unbreakable (lambda () (let l () (printf "I'm unbreakable.") (sleep 100) (l)))])
              (let loop ()
                (let/ec k
                  (current-exception-handler
                   (lambda (exn)
                     (cond
                       [(exn:break? exn)
                        (printf "Break!~n") (sleep 5) (printf "Unbreak~n")
                        (break-enabled #f)
                        (k (void))]
                       [else (parent-exn-handler)])))
                  (break-enabled #t)
                  (printf "hi~n")
                  (sleep 3)
                  (unbreakable))
                (loop))))))
