>Description:
Check-syntax can't handle require clauses of the form 
  (only (lib "13.ss" "srfi") string-contains)

Upon hitting check syntax with such a module in the definitions window,  I get an internal error that reads

    standard-module-name-resolver: expects argument of type <module path>; given (only (lib "13.ss" "srfi") string-contains)

After hitting OK, the definitions window is unresponsive and will not repaint itself.
>How-To-Repeat:
Module language; enter the following in the definitions window:

(module foo mzscheme
  (require (only (lib "13.ss" "srfi") string-contains)))

and hit check-syntax.

 Never mind -- this has been fixed; I was just running a version of
 DrScheme from before the fix.
