 Unfortunately monospaced'ness is (not a word) built pretty deeply into
 how code is displayed. I think the only recourse is to find a font
 whose bold and regular versions are the same width. Or don't use bold.

 It's not a question of monspacedness:  the bold font you use appears to be
 monospaced.  I think the problem is that the width of the space character
 adjusts for point size, but is the same in bold and non-bold contexts.
 
 The indenter is putting in the right number of spaces, but those spaces
 aren't wide enough.
 
 Try the following at some huge point size so you can see the alignment
 clearly:
 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 X X X X X X X X
 M M M M M M M M
 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
 
 When everything is bold, the first three lines align nicely, but the fourth
 one comes out different, illustrating that all the bold  printing characters
 are the same width, but space is a different width.
 
 When you make numbers and symbols non-bold, then the all four lines come out
 nicely aligned, illustrating that characters and spaces are all the same
 width in non-bold.
 
 Of course this doesn't say what to do when some characters on a line are
 bold and some are not.
 I'd default to using the bold-sized space if anything on the line is bold.
 That will at least make the common case, eg
 
 (foo
  bar)
 
 non-crappy.  Anybody who wants to get other kinds of alignment, eg
 
   (car x)
  (cadr x)
 (caddr x)
 
 does so at his own risk.

 This sounds like a case of a broken font -- one aspect of monospace
 fonts should have exactly the same width regardless of being bold or
 not.  To try it, I set drr to use a bold font for comments, then I
 wrote:
 
   ;MMMMMMMMMMMM
    MMMMMMMMMMMM
   ;           M
               M
 
 and all lines end at exactly the same place.  If you do the same and
 they don't, then that font is broken (or not a monospace font).
 
 (BTW, I tried it on linux, via VNC.)

 Yup, it's Lucida Console's fault.  I tried Eli's experiment with
 
 11111111111111
 ;MMMMMMMMMMMMM
  MMMMMMMMMMMMM
  M M M M M M M
 
 The first three lines should be the same width in any monospaced font.
 The last line will be the same width as the others if space is the right
 width.
 
 All the non-bold monospaced fonts I tried were fine.
 
 In bold here's what I found:
 
 OK:
 Courier New
 Lucida Sans Typewriter
 
 Wrong-sized space:
 Lucida Console
 Miriam Fixed
 Terminal
 Courier New Baltic [under "other..."]
 
 OTOH, Lucida Console in MS Notepad works fine, even up to 72pt Bold.
 
 This was all under Windows 7.  I tried to get at drscheme on login@ccs via
 X, however when I started drscheme, it came up with some obscenely small
 font that I  couldn't see, even under the Windows Magnifier.  (Stop by my
 office tomw and I'll show you).

 Under windows 7 I like bitstream Vera sans mono (it has to be
 downloaded but is easy to install if you get the zip file-- just
 double click on the font files and click "install"). I didn't check
 its bold face behavior tho.

 Okay, it turns out it is possible to make the colorer pay attention to
 whitespace and color it based on settings like the other categories.
 If we made this change, Mitch could set whitespace to boldface if he
 wanted. (The more general thing of looking for nearby boldspace won't
 work with the current setup for the colorer; the way the software is
 organized, there is a lexer that is running continuously on the editor
 and periodically throwing ranges of text and lexical categories "over
 the wall" in the form of directives to color the editor; trying to do
 something that doesn't fit into that strategy is probably not a good
 idea.)
 
 But, this turns out to be slow down opening big files by somewhere
 between 5% and 10% (it is not particularly easy to measure this, given
 the incremental nature of the computation so my test was approximate)
 so I think that probably it is not worth adding this.
 
 So, unless we have any disagreement, I think we should probably leave
 this as "please use a different font or don't use bold ...".
