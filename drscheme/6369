>Description:
After some amount of editing, the greying of parenthetical
s-expressions stops working.  Some operations restore
the behavior.  We have one way of (reproducing) this
problem, but there may be other ways of doing it also.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a new buffer, insert a comment box and type
  (x y)
into the box.  Now select the whole box, copy, paste.
Go into the box, and choose Scheme | Uncomment.
Now you have (x y) in the code, but placing the cursor
  at ( or at ) does not highlight the s-exp.
Saving the file seems to restore highlighting.
Also, switching to another window (like the bug report
  window) and switching back also restores it.

 This PR seems to come down to the fact that on-focus in an editor is
 not called when the focus moves from an text% inside an editor-snip% to
 the editor outside it.
 
 Run the code below. If you click in and out of the inner editor, you
 get on-focus calls. But, if you set the focus to the inner editor and
 then click the button, the focus seems to move to the outer editor, but
 no callback is invoked.
 
 Also, unrelated to the PR, when I click from the outer editor to the
 inner one, it seems that the on-focus methods are called in the wrong
 order (ie, the focus is temporarily in two places). I can't think of
 anywhere that this would break things in drscheme, but if that were the
 case for other on-focus methods (windows, say) drscheme would certainly
 be broken. Is it possible to establish the invariant that on-focus is
 only called with #t *after* it has been called with #f?
