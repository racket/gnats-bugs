>Description:
Consider a preference for undocking the interactions window
from drscheme. 

One of the Quack options is to have a window for the REPL buffer with a dedicated (desktop window system) frame.  Emacs will then not use this frame for any purpose other than the REPL.

I think I first saw something that in ILISP.  I usually use it to, e.g., make a very wide or very narrow REPL frame on my desktop, while keeping my code frames a standard 80 columns wide.  Leaves more space on desktop for shell and Web browser windows.  Tile as much as practical, rather than overlap.  This is especially important now that PLT has moved to the Web browser for documentation and the page layout is currently rather greedy with horizontal real estate.

So, an undockable Interactions window in DrScheme would be nice, as would documentation layout that doesn't want a window wider than the body text.  Variable width of the body text flow would help too.
