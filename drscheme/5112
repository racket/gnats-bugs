>Description:
I've noticed that find does not highlight the found word unless
the word is replaced. If the word appears multiple times the window
does scroll down so that the next occurance of the word appears 
within the window. This only seems to happen when search does not 
use a separate dialogue window. When the search box is hidden, the
found word will be highlighted.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a file.
Search for any word you know is contained in it, not using a separate dialogue window for searching.
Notice the lack of highlighting.
Hide the search, and the highlighting shows up.
