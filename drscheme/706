>How-To-Repeat:
Type the follwing into a DrScheme buffer:

 ; in->cm: num[in] -> num[cm]
 (define

Hit Tab for the (define line. It moves over one space. Hit tab
again. It moves over to line up the ( with the c in cm. 

Removing the [] reduces the weirdness to the previous PR, i.e.,
(define jumps left or right one space with each Tab.
