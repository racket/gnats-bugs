(Sorry if this is fixed in a more recent DrScheme ... I don't have
access to anything newer than 208p1 here in the computer lab and I
wanted to submit this bug before I forgot it.)
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
the bug was that the code didn't anticipate that an image-snip% might
not have a bitmap% in it. Now, it does. It uses the snip's draw method
and get-extent method to build the bitmap (and get the snips size).

 In order to fix this properly, I need to be able to turn an image-snip
 that has no bitmap into a bitmap that looks like it looks. I can just
 code this up, but I think that maybe it would be better if I didn't
 duplicate the code that actually draws the box with the X thru it. Is
 it worth making that code public somehow? I guess I could create the
 bitmap by making a bitmap-dc and calling the snip's draw method. Is
 that a reasonable approach?

 Yes, that sounds reasonable.
