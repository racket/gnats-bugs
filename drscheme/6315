>Description:
The compile-pattern function provided by the
reduction-semantics collection doesn't work; it
complains of a contract violation within
reduction-semantics.ss.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load, e.g., reduction-semantics/examples/arithmetic.ss.
Comment out the (gui ...) call at the end.
Hit execute.

Evaluate
> (compile-pattern lang 'number)
3.3: top-level: "../reduction-semantics.ss" broke compile-pattern's contract: expected a procedure that accepts 3 arguments, given: #<procedure:...ivate/matcher.ss:407:7>
>Fix:
the contract was wrong. it didn't get updated when the library last
changed.
