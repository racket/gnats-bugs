>Description:
Hi Robby --
Don't know if this has been fixed in v299, but in v208p1
I get an error when I try to paste a syntax-snip on Mac OSX.
I can cut/copy the snip, but when I try pasting it I get
   syntax-snip%: got non-syntax object

Cheers --
Ian
>How-To-Repeat:
(syntax 4)
  ;; Highlight and copy (command-C) the result.
  ;; Then try to paste, into either the repl or file-window.

 I've "fixed" this for v299, but there are still some problems. In
 general, syntax objects cannot be marshalled to strings, since they may
 contain arbitrary stuff and because some of the properties may be
 private. I've kind of hacked around that for now, but a real solution
 requires some support from mzscheme, I believe.
 
 Thanks for the report!
