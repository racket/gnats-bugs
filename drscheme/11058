>Description:
I've argued that C-x closes the wrong window.  Worse, it leaves the cursor in the *other* window's last position.  So if I now do keyboard navigation, my screen suddenly jumps to where I was looking in the window that DrRacket closed.

Oh, I think this is a much more general problem: in Emacs, each window has its own cursor.  In DrRacket, all windows seem to be sharing the same cursor -- this problem seems to manifest even if I don't close anything.  

This is seriously buggy in terms of using the same keystrokes as Emacs but with grossly different meaning.  In particular, each window really ought to maintain its own cursor!  In Emacs, C-x 2 gives you the ability to *navigate*.  In DrScheme, it appears to be something that should be treated purely as "read-only".  (At least now the behavior of C-x 0 makes sense -- in the sense of there being internal consistency.)

(I even seem to be able to get the little bar that holds the #lang line to *blink*, which is may be more excitement from an IDE than I can withstand.)

 Yes, the position of the insertion point is state associated with the
 editor, not the display of the editor so, iiuc, that is what both of
 your PRs are asking for to be changed. (Also, I think "grossly
 different" apply if c-x 0 and c-x 2 meant, respectively "delete all
 your files" and "send email to all your friends to try to sell them
 viagra" but it seems a bit hyperbolic in this context (much like the
 parenthetical that this parenthetical is inside :).)

 I'm not disagreeing that it could be even more grossly different (-:.
 But when it seriously screws with muscle-memory developed over two
 decades, that's bad enough.  That's all I'm getting at.
 
 Thanks,
