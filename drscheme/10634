>Description:
When a bitmap image is scaled in 2htdp/image, if the resulting image has a width or height that is not an exact integer, the attempt to display it bombs out when trying to create the rendered bitmap in the do-scale procedure in mrlib/image-core.ss.  In the below example, the icon is of size 17 so 1/2 it is 17/2, a non-integer.  The same problem can also manifest, however, with an icon with an even side length, if the scale is the inexact 0.5 rather than 1/2, since then the resulting size is likewise inexact.  I was able to patch this by editing (exact->inexact (round ...)) into the bindings of scale-w and scale-h.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/image)
(scale 1/2 (bitmap icons/b-run.png))
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
This may have been a type error, if the type system can distinguish exact integers from other kinds of numbers. Note that TS can.
