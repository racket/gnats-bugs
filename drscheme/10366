>Description:
I installed plt-scheme and it worked fine for a day or so, then with no warning this started to happen:

<error-message>
draw-bitmap in dc<%>: expected argument of type <bitmap% object>; given #f

 === context ===
C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\drscheme\private\drscheme-normal.ss:208:15
</error-message>

(xml tags added by me ;-)  This is all I see, and I see it in what appears to be an ordinary windows command shell window.

After this the program just hangs and I can't do anything. Sad really ;)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrScheme from the start-menu.
2. Watch it crash.
>Fix:
There was a bug in the startup splash screen code that was triggered by Eli's bday easter egg
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. It wouldn't have been a type error, since there would have been a bitmap option in the wrong state. Altho a typed language might have forced me to have a dummy case in there (which is what the fixed ended up being).

 Looks like a bug specific to the date. Sorry for the trouble. It will
 pass if you change your computer's date or if you wait until tomorrow.

Reason>>> This has been fixed in SVN.

Thanks for the report.
