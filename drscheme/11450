 It can.. but only if you put the interactions window next to the
 definitions window by checking a box in preferences->general. It might
 be nice to split the definitions pane so you get two windows side by
 side even when the interactions window is below the definitions window.
 
 Having gone through this code just recently I don't think its a hard
 change to make. Maybe add a new option to the View menu like
   * Split horizontally
   * Split vertically
 
 ?

Responsible changed from "robby" to "rafkind" by robby at Fri, 07 Jan 2011 14:47:21 -0500
Reason>>> Looks like Jon is volunteering :)

In all seriousness, the hard part will be tracking the
precise configuration of splits (the tree of vertical and
horizontals and the associated percentages) to deal with
shifting around between tabs. The lower-level
horizontal/vertical panels stuff is all there and easy.

 Oh yea I forgot about this. If I can get it to work reasonably well soon
 I'll make sure it makes it into the next release.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by rafkind at Wed, 02 Mar 2011 12:46:58 -0500
