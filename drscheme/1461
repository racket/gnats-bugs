>Description:
1) Selecting `Kill' when no expression is being evaluated 
   does not prevent the user from typing in the interactions
   window. (Nothing typed gets executed, though.)

2) Selecting `Kill' during evaluation (e.g., a loop), seems
   to kill ok, but doesn't reset the Evaluate button, etc. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Start Drscheme
   Select `Kill'
   Type in interactions window

2) Start DrScheme
   Switch to Full Scheme
   Eval `(let loop () (loop))'
   Select `Kill'
