>Description:
When opening a read-only file in DrScheme the editor is locked
and no changes can be made to the buffer (in fact even the syntax
colorer doesn't work).  But executing or using any tool unlocks
the editor after which changes can be made (and the syntax colorer
works).

I can't figure out what the intended behavior is:
- is the file supposed to be locked all the time and there's a bug
somewhere that makes using execute or a tool accidentally unlock
the editor?  In that case it would be nice to at least allow tools
to color the editor and just prevent inserts and deletes.
- is the file not supposed to be locked and somehow the fact that's
it's read-only accidentally makes the editor locked?

Also, once I've been able to modify the file and I try to save it
I get a nasty "save-file in text%: cannot open output file:
"foo.ss" (Permission denied; errno=13)" error message before seeing
the nicer message box from DrScheme telling something bad happened
during saving (although at that point it doesn't bother telling
me what was the problem...)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file with some Scheme code in it.  Close the editor
and make the file read-only.  Open the file in DrScheme: it will
be locked.  Click execute.  The editor is not locked anymore.

 Wow, this bug was in v201! It looks like it should be an obvious fix,
 but the code is suspicious and I'm not sure if I'd be breaking some
 hidden invariant with the fix. So, I'm going to wait until after the
 release to fix it.
