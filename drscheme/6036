>Description:
I just opened a program and found this nasty surprise. 
Can someone check whether this went into 203? I updated
last night to exp tagged (again) but found I had missed
some files before. 
>How-To-Repeat:
i opened a drscheme and typed in this (module language):

(module contour-bug mzscheme 
  (define some-html 
    <table><tr><td>Hello World<br>tmorrow is another day</br></td></tr></table>	)
  
  (define thatsit 0))

in case it isn't clear, the xml box is a box. file is attached. 

i then asked to see the contour, and things worked fine. 
i closed drscheme. 

i reopened drscheme (post-203 release) and opened the 
program again. volia`, i got the contour with large letters. 
>Fix:
the bug was that the after-load-file didn't properly update
the editor. It seemed to be leftover code from an eralier strategy for implementing the contour window that didn't get updated when I moved to the current strategy.

>Release-Note:
there was no contract violation, but there could have been
one. If the contour's editor class had had a contract on the insert method, it would have said that only certain snips are allowed to be inserted and that would have signalled an error when Matthias saw the bad contour window.

In addition, if there had been a backtrace that would have been
enough information to reproduce the bug, since after-load-file
would have been in the backtrace.

 P.S. I just noticed that I was running the 203 test bundle. So it is 
 in the release.

 I filled out a PR on this, but perhaps I didn't submit it.  The problem 
 occurs reliably for programs that are not saved as text files.
 
 To repeat this, you need to create a new file, save it, click 'no' on 
 the 'save file as text?' dialog, close the window, open a new window, 
 and open the file you just saved.

 The contour window works fine for me.
 
 Are you using the default font?

 John, I didn't see a PR that you submitted go by, nor do the steps you
 list reproduce the problem for me. Perhaps you can list out exactly
 what you do more carefully? (It seems you have some non-standard
 preferences set, for one). Also, if you could CC people when you reply
 to unclaimed PRs, that would also be helpful.
 
 Matthias, I cannot reproduce your description either. I also see from
 the PR log that Matthew asked a question that wasn't answered (at least
 the answer didn't make the log). What was the answer?

Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2003 10:05:55 -0500

 trail&pr=6036&database=plt
 
 This is the contour bug.  Matthias submitted an attachment to the PR  
 which does reproduce the bug (for me).  Unfortunately, it took me WAY  
 too long to figure out how to extract it from GNATS's clutches.  To  
 save y'all the time, here's how to do it:
 
 1) find the PR in GNATS, then go to the edit engine, rather than the  
 viewing engine.
 2) Find the table of attachments, and click the 'download this  
 attachment' button.
 3) Rename the file contour.ss to contour.ss.bin.
 4) Click 'yes' on the 'are you sure you want to change this file's  
 extension?' dialog.
 5) Double-click the new file to open it in Stuffit Expander, which  
 should create contour-bug.ss
 6) start DrScheme
 
 IMPORTANT NEW INFO:
 
 7) type a few chars in an empty window, then choose Show Contour
 8) then, open the file contour-bug.ss in that window.
 
 It turns out (I just discovered this) that if you open the  
 contour-bug.ss file in a window without a contour and then show it, the  
 contour is okay (the bug does not appear).  Furthermore, if you Hide  
 and then Show the contour, the bug disappears.
 
 Now can you reproduce it?
 
 john
 
 p.s.  I don't seem to be in agreement with Matthias about the meaning  
 of the 'Analyzed' state.  In my mind, it indicates that the person  
 responsible for the bug has a good idea of what has caused the bug and  
 how to fix it.  Is this not the same definition that others use?

 This seems to be quite a wierd problem -- I can reproduce it and it
 makes my DrScheme go into a wierd state where the font says that it is
 Courier New but appears to actually be Courier (you may notice the
 letters look a little bit different after following the steps).
 
 FWIW, John's steps 3, 4, and 5 are not neccessary for me.
 
 Also, if I show the contour in a newly started up DrScheme and then
 open the file (in that window) I see the bug too, even without the
 "reuse existing frames" preference set (which I assume John is using).
