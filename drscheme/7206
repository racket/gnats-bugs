>Description:
I was trying to modify the image.ss teachpack in .../collects/htdp.  Playing it conservatively, I added a new function to the source file, didn't use it or "provide" it or anything, saved the file back to .../collects/htdp, loaded it in another DrScheme window, and tried using the "rectangle" function.  I got a "DrScheme Internal Error" window, saying "hash-table-get: expects type <hash-table> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: test-coverage-points5424".  I was unable to close the error window or quit DrScheme nicely (not to mention use Help Desk to report the problem!), so I had to use OS X's "force quit" feature.  This has happened several times.  Even after I restored the image.ss file (verified with "diff") to exactly the way it looked before I added an unused function, I was still unable to use it; however, restoring the image.ss file from my backup copy worked.

 You have to compile the .zo files. This is an efficiency issue, which
 is why we have such a bad error message. Fixing the error message is a
 huge slowdown in the teaching languages, but we did it anyways for 299.
 
 Or, if you'd like, you can just use the module language to develop
 image.ss and test it in the teaching languages when you're satisfied
 with it.
