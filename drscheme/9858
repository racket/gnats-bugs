Subject: inconsistent arity for get-metadata

>Number:         9858
>Category:       drscheme
>Synopsis:       inconsistent arity for get-metadata
>Class:          sw-bug
>Responsible:    robby
>Severity:       serious
>Priority:       medium

>Submitter-Id:   unknown
>Release:        4.1.1.3
>Environment:
mac-i386-osx
>Description:
The get-metadata method of drscheme:language:language<%> is documented in Help Desk with 0 arguments, defined and used in most code with 2 arguments, and defined in module-based-language->language-mixin with 3 arguments.

Two arguments seems correct; the method is never called for module-based-languages as their get-reader-module method returns #f.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
Corrected the arity and the docs, as suggested in the PR.
>Release-Note:
This would have been a contract violation, if the code had been reachable.

This is a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "doc-bug" to "sw-bug" by robby at Thu, 30 Oct 2008 22:49:49 -0400
Reason>>> Since there is a sw-bug, I changed it to sw-bug, so I'll
find this later when I look up contract stats.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 30 Oct 2008 22:49:49 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.
