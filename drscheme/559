>Description:
Where did the save as text menu item go?  I can't convert my WXME file
into a normal text file with this DrScheme 51.  (MrEd works, though.)
Robby says there is a test suite that should have caught this bug.  Hence,
this is both a product bug and a testing-process bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a WXME file in DrScheme.
Look for "Save Definitions As Text..." in the File menu.

 The menu test isn't looking for that item.  Presumably,
 the item was already gone by the time the menu test was
 written.
 
 I'll add it into the test.

 Was this menu item intentionally deleted?
