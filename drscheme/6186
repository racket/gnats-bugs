>Description:
Within the last 24 hours (from 16:00 EST, 2 Apr 03),
something changed in the module language to disallow
(or at least break) providing macros from a module.
When I try to execute or check-syntax the module
given below, I get the error message:
     catch-error: bad syntax in: catch-error
with the occurrence of catch-error in the provide
clause highlighted.  This happens regardless of
whether the provide clause precedes or follows
the definition.

Both execution and check syntax work fine if the
language level is set to Textual.

This works fine for both module & textual languages
in officially-released 203.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following module definition in the
definitions window.

(module utils mzscheme
  
  (provide catch-error)

  (define-syntax catch-error
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(_ pred? body1 body ...)
       (with-handlers ([pred? (lambda (x) 'caught-error)])
         (begin body1 body ...))])))

Set the language level to `module'.  Hit either the
check-syntax or execute buttons.

Set the language level to `textual'.  Hit either
the check-syntax or execute buttons.

 This is fixed now. I think you missed the earlier PR that went by.
 Please cvs update.
 
 Thanks,
