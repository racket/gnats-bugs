>Description:
Consider the following program:

#lang scheme

(require (only-in scheme [+ foo]))

(foo 3 4)

If you hit Check Syntax, and then right click on foo, you get menu item "view documentation for foo".   However, you then get the documentation for `+'.  This could be surprising, especially if the renaming happened in some other file. 

It would be nice if it said something like:  "view documentation for foo (actually + from scheme)"  (not in those exact words).  
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
None of the available names were the right thing, but I had just picked one. Matthew added something to scribble and I now use that (see the email transcript for details).
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.

 I made an attempt at this (earlier) and I ended up getting strange
 results for identifiers that were provided by the contract library
 (ie, seeing the exported/renamed variable from the contract library
 instead of the actual name that shows up in the user's program).
 
 So, anyways, I'm not sure what the right answer is for this. Matthew?

 I think that the doc system will have to provide a mapping from
 bindings to documented names. That will let you show the information
 that Sam requests without getting the strange internal names.

 Okay, I can wait for that. I think the current behavior is probably
 the best, until that comes along.

 I've added `xref-tag->index-entry', which takes the tag that you
 already have (to find the documentation) and returns an `entry' struct
 that has a `decs' field that may hold an `exported-index-dec' that has
 the documented name and exporting library.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 17 Dec 2007 18:17:44 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks.
