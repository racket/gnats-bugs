>Description:
I'm not sure of the platform, this happened to me on Shalom.
When I try to check-syntax on new files, I receive the error message:
Internal Error: with-parameterization: expects argument of type <parameterization>; given #f
This has happens only on the second and all subsequent files I open using new.
It works perfectly on the first window I get by typing drscheme &, and also
works on all existing files I open.
