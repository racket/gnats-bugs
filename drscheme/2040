>Description:
Searching in the HelpDesk:

- using the options "for Keyword, Index Entry, or Text" and
"containing match", if I search for "open-input-file",the cursor
in the "find docs for" blinks continuously while searching, the
windows redraw correctly if hidden/unhidden, and the search
completes after 20-25 seconds.

- using the options "for Keyword or Index Entry" and
"containing match", if I search for "class",the cursor
in the "find docs for" blinks continuously while searching, the
windows redraw correctly if hidden/unhidden, and the search
completes after some seconds.

- using the options "for Keyword, Index Entry, or Text" and
"exact match", if I search for "class",the cursor
in the "find docs for" blinks continuously while searching, the
windows redraw correctly if hidden/unhidden, and the search
completes after some seconds.

But:
- using the options "for Keyword, Index Entry, or Text" and
"containing match", if I search for "class", the cursor
in the "find docs for" stops blinking after about three seconds,
the windows don't redraw anymore, and the search seems to never
terminate. "top" indicates a cpu usage of close to 100%, and a
memory usage of about 60-70 MB (as opposed to a stable 20-30 MB
during the other tests). The GC icon blinks from time to time.
DrScheme has to be killed from the shell.

So it looks like the combination of
"for Keyword, Index Entry, or Text", "containing match", and
"class" triggers an infinite loop. I tried to search for other
common words like "lambda" or "function" but had no problem. I
tried then to search for "e" and hit the problem again after
a second or so.

So obviously the HelpDesk doesn't like searches that return
too many matches.

>How-To-Repeat:
Open the HelpDesk
select the "for Keyword, Index Entry, or Text"
and "containing match" options
type "e" in the "find docs for" and... press enter

 This bug appears to be sparc specific. Certainly the described behavior
 doesn't happen under linux-ppc (mred gets up to about 20 megs with the
 searching described below, running standalone help-desk).

 I take it back. It's not a bug. It works. It's just that it takes 233
 minutes on my machine for the result to appear, and that the GUI
 completely freezes while the search takes place...

 Probably still a sparc-specific bug, unless you have a really old,
 low-memory memory machine?

 64MB ultra 5.
 Something I just noticed: the problem doesn't occur when using the
 helpdesk standalone, only when using it from drscheme. I tried both
 several times, with the same options and of course the same set of
 manuals installed. When starting the helpdek standalone, the answer
 comes back very quickly. When doing the same full-text search for "e"
 using the helpdesk that I start from within drscheme, the search takes
 forever. The interesting thing is that, before freezing, the helpdesk
 has enough time to update its scrollbar, and from the relative size of
 the scrollbar button it seems like the search is finding a lot more
 stuff than when doing the same search from the helpdesk standalone...
 
 I won't be able to experiment much more than that, the system guys are
 right next to me to take my machine away and replace it with a blade
 :-)

State-Changed-Why:

fixed and released. there were two problems.  The main problem was that
drscheme disbaled breaks defaultly, so the technique of sending a break to
the searching thread in Help Desk didn't work in DrScheme (so *lots* of
search results were coming back). The secondary problem was that DrScheme
had some with-handler expressions that caught all exceptions, but should
have let break exceptions through, so the breaks that signalled termination
of searching weren't being handled properly.

 Okay. I found and fixed the bug. there are three changed files: 
 
   plt/collects/drscheme/private/init.ss
   plt/collects/help/private/search.ss
   plt/collects/help/private/helpwin.ss
 
 I've committed and tagged those files, so if you get the new versions,
 things should work properly now.
