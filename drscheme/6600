>Description:
If I select several Scheme files in the Finder, then hit pretzel-O
(or choose the "File->Open" menu item), frequently only one of the
files is actually opened.  It seems to get all the files correctly
iff (or (not (running? DrScheme))
        (> (num-open-windows DrScheme) 0))
(BTW, HelpDesk counts as an open DrScheme window.)
I'm running MacOS 10.2.8.

 Just thought I'd mention that this bug is still present in 209.

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
