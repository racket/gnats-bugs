>Description:
DrRacket has trouble with reasonable sized path names and creating a launcher executable. It gives an error that the command line is too long.

Note: This bug was not reproducible on a 32bit DrRacket.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Save an the following empty program:
#lang racket
2. Make sure that the path is somewhat long, I needed around
/Users/eric/tmp/longlong/test.rkt.

3. Try to create an executable using the DrRacket menu item selecting Launcher and GRacket.

Observe error message.

create-embedding-executable: command line too long: '("-I" "scheme/gui/init" "-qt-" "/Users/eric/tmp/longlong/test.rkt")
