>Description:
When I select "Print rationals in whole/part notation" as the
output syntax for the beginning student language level, I get
wrong answers for negative numbers with a fractional part.

For example, (* 5/9 -9) correctly yields -5,
but (* 5/9 -10) incorrectly yields (+ -5 -4/9)
and (* 5/9 -11) incorrectly yields (+ -6 -8/9).

Also, (+ -1/3 -2/3) correctly yields -1,
but (+ -2/3 -2/3) incorrectly yields (+ -1 -2/3).
>How-To-Repeat:
Please see description above.
