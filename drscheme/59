>Description:
	I opened a web page in MrEd. Then I tried to open a text file
from disk. The result was an error message in the console from
`normalize-path' about the inappropriateness of "http:..."; no
window appeared for the text file. Closing the Web page fixed everything;
after closing the Web Page frame, I could open and read the text file.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
	Perhaps this is a problem in code that checks whether a file
is already open to avoid opening a new frame/buffer?
