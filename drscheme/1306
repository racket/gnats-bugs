depending on the user's preference.

>How-To-Repeat:
Set the preference for using the platform-independent file dialog
Select the "Save Interactions As..." menu item

 Fixed, but I cannot release that file because of other changes, so it
 will have to wait for my next release. I hope this is not too pressing.
 
 If you want to make changes to your local copy, here is the diff (but
 you will have to apply it manually because line numbers have changed
 from the exp tagged version)
