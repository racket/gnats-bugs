>Description:
Searching for a file in DrScheme using "Search in Files" follows cycles in directory paths due to symbolic links.  This results in a non-terminating search and some menu item with a too-long name.  None of the menu items or menu keybindings work after that, including Quit.  Instead, trying to use any menu item
or pull down a menu gives an error like the one below.

initialization for menu-item%: expects argument of type <string (up to 200 characters)>; given "/home/ptg/.gnome-desktop/Home directory/.gnome-desktop/Home directory/.gnome-desktop/Home direct...

>How-To-Repeat:
Make a symbolic link in a directory to a parent directory.
Choose "Search in Files" starting with the parent directory.
Click the Stop button after a while.
Try to use a menu.
