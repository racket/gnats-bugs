>Description:
Cmd-M in OSX is the system-wide standard for Minimize.  So the 
Split command should probably be changed to Cmd-Opt-M or something 
else.

 Yeah, cmd-opt keyboard short cuts! I love that idea. :)

Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 04:58:29 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 09:59:43 -0400
Reason>>> drscheme request (maybe rejected?)
Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Sat, 12 Mar 2005 08:53:10 -0500
Reason>>> I've changed the shortcut for collapse so that it only appears for non-macosx 
platforms.

but cmd-m still doesn't minimize the window.

also, the opt-based menu shortcuts seems like it's yours, too.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:05 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
