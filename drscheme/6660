 Were you using the intermediate language? I see that it doesn't work
 there, and I suspect that something is wrong with the expansion of let
 in intermediate.

 PS: It's useful if you use Help Desk to submit the PR from inside
 drscheme. We get lots more information, like what language you using,
 in this case.

 I know, I was half-way through submitting this, then I saw that it
 happens in advanced too so the extra help-desk info wouldn't help
 much.  (Instead, I should have explicitly mentioned that it happens in
 advanced too.)
 
 (I blame sleep deprivation (and OSX developers, obviously).)
