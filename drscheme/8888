>Description:
The font list in DrScheme's preferences (even in the separate dialog box you get when you choose "Other" from the drop-down menu) doesn't list all of the fonts on my system.
>How-To-Repeat:
Checked out, built, and installed DrScheme for the first time on a new machine, so I didn't even have a PLT prefs file.  

Started DrScheme, selected module language, opened help desk, clicked on 'manuals', clicked on 'refresh all manuals.'  When docs installation complete, closed DrScheme and restarted it.  Opened Preferences box w/ M-comma; chose "Other..." from Font Name drop down menu.  Wanted to select "Lucida Sans Typewriter," but the font doesn't appear in the list, even though it is installed on the machine.

Screenshot at http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/misc/drscheme-fonts.png demonstrates that Lucida Sans Typewriter is installed and visible to other apps.  It also demonstrates that DrScheme can see other Lucida fonts; all of the Lucida fonts (including Lucida Sans Typewriter) are installed in $HOME/Library/Fonts.

OS X 10.4.10 w/ all security updates applied.

 Never mind.  I forgot that, after installing fonts on OS X, one has to log
 out and log back in again before certain apps can see the new fonts.  This
 is true for DrScheme but not apparently for TextEdit -- perhaps it's a
 Carbon-vs-Cocoa thing?
 
 In any case, this was my mistake; close the bug report.
 
 Thanks,
