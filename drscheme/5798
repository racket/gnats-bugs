>Description:
alpha renaming failed on a file that contained two 
XML boxes with nested Scheme boxes that both call 
the function (which was not in a box)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
the renamer muts filter out duplicate identifiers, since some macros may duplicate their source, which would lead to renaming the same original program text twice (which would mangle the original program).

the bug: the comparison for multiple identifiers was wrong -- it assumed that all identifiers were in the same editor
>Release-Note:
an equality predicate was too lax. there's no direct predicate for that, really.
