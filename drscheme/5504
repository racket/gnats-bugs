>Description:
(as in summary), a possible quick fix may be to display the
"new" file in the present file window, optionally saving the
present file as done with "open recent..", and defining an
"new window" menu item which simply does just that. (as a minor
note, I wonder if "open here..." best remains named "open...",
to be consistant with most Mac/OSX apps.
>How-To-Repeat:
after opening an arbitrary file in the definition window,
the only way to define a new file's contents is to delete the
present files contents (which seems very dangerious), and then
"save definitions as.." the desired new file, or visa-versa.

 I'm not following what you want here -- when in "open here" mode, if
 you choose File|New, you get a new window and then can open new files
 there. Does that help?

 Thoughts were to basically to enable file operations to occur within the
 top-most window by default, only opening additional window/environments
 explicitly. (I appreciate my last post confused things, very sorry, what
 I should have more properly requested as a possible quick fix to this goal
 was be a new "Initialize" menu item, to reinitialize the active definition
 window to allow it to be re-used to define a new set of definitions without
 having to open a new window to do so, as below:
 
 New         -> (as now) creates new initialized top-level-environment
                 window.
 
 Open...     -> (as now) opens existing file in existing definition window
                 using file browser, optionally saving the existing file if
                 modified.
 
 Open URL... -> (close to as now) opens URL dialog box/window. (but presume
                 file browsing would be redundant with the above file
                 "Open..." menu item.)
 
 Open Recent -> (as now) from list, opens recent files in existing window as
                 above.
 
 Revert      -> (as now) optionally re-opens the existing file, loosing any
                 edits.
 
 Initialize  -> (new) clears/reinitializes the present definition window
                 after optionally saving the existing file if modified, to
                 allow a new set of definitions to be easily defined without
                 having to open a new window.
 
 Save        -> (as now) saves existing open file/definition window.
 
 Save As...  -> (as now) as above using file browser dialog box/window.
 
 Save Others -> (as now) from list, ...
 
 (... remaining as now, but likely without the "quit" menu item.)

 the "Open..." menu changes to "Open Here..." because I wanted to
 indicate that the behavior of this menu item had changed. Since it is
 the most obvious way to notice the changed preference, it seemed like a
 good idea. In that vein, perhaps I should add a "New Here" menu item
 (but that does seem like a bad title). I don't think that "initialize"
 is particularly good term either, tho.
 
 Also, the Open Url... menu item is a bit funny -- it is going to change
 for 201, which is due out at the end of the summer, so I think that
 I'll leave it alone for now.

 Maybe defining "New" as a menu list containing "Window", and "File" works
 best for all situations, as is done in some applications.

 I've committed changes to the CVS archive that chnage the way "New"
 behaves when the "single frame mode" preference is set. Now, the menu
 item's label is "New..." and it asks you if you want to create a new
 window or not. Hitting <return> in the dialog (so you don't have to
 leave the keyboard) means just to re-use the existing frame.
 
 Let me know what you think.

 I like it, much more convenient; any luck finding the problem preventing
 recent files from properly opening in the re-used windows reliably?

 No, sorry. I just tried again. Here's what I did:
 
   - start drscheme
   - set the "reuse .. frames .." preference.
   - chose the "show recently opened files in separate frame ..." menu item
   - click on many different recently opened files.
 
 When I did that, I saw each file open up in the drscheme window and it
 all seemed to work great.

 How about something like:
 
 - start drscheme
 - set "reuse..."
 - "open here..." /Applications/PLT/collects/browser/browser.ss
   > which should display the file in the window
 - "open here..." /Applications/PLT/collects/browser/browser-sig.ss

 (this consistently happens on both the released and prerelease version)

 Problem Found !!!
 
 - If the file is READ-ONLY, the widow's editor frame doesn't update,
   effectively preventing the file from even being displayed, only when
   in "reuse existing frame..." mode.
 
 - because the distribution files are installed as root:admin with
   -rw-r--r-- privileges, no one other than root has write permission.
 
 - If you are root no problem, otherwise the window frame does not update
   until only after you fist try to open a file which you do have write
   permission for, then the next file if also writeable will properly be
   displayed.
 
 The fix would be to:
 
 - update the window and editor frame regardless of write privilege,
   although the file should be prevented from being saved under the
   same name, it should be allowed to be saved under a different name.
 
 and optionally to also:
 
 - If the distributed files remain installed as root:admin, they could be
   given -rw-rw-r-- privileges by default so that any one who is a member
   of the admin group could at least have the opportunity to optionally save
   the file; rather than either having to login as root, or change the
   permissions on the files to save a tweak to the distributed files (which
   hopefully seems like a reasonable, but likely lower priority tweak).
 
 Best of luck, thanks again for your help,
 
 -paul-

 - Yes, setting a maximum size would be nice, as an increasingly
   long list becomes cumbersome.
 
 - And still need a delete, otherwise how exactly does one remove
   a reference to a file which has been deleted or renamed?

 Oh, it should just go away, but I can add something that filters out
 non-existing files at various points.

 I've added a preference for that one (there is a new slider in the
 preferences panel -- the missing title is a macos x bug, I believe. I
 know about it). The files are committed now, too.

 I think that it is best to just let those fall off the list. The
 current problem is that I don't want to do disk access too often to
 figure out when the files have been removed or renamed.

 Thanks for finding this one! The fix is committed now.
