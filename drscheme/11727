>Description:
There are a couple of cases of event handling oddities that I suspect are related. The problems occur with the 10.6 SDK 64-bit builds on my system. The problem only occurs in the 64-bit build, it does not occur with either 32-bit build I tried (10.4 SDK and 10.6 SDK). I wasn't able to build a 10.4 SDK 64-bit build (CC=gcc-4.0 isn't propagated to libatomic sub-build), so I didn't try that one. All of these were tested on the release branch. Additionally, I verified the problem doesn't exist in the 5.0.99.900 official build.
>How-To-Repeat:
Case 1) Open DrRacket. Right-click the icon in the dock and select quit. Nothing happens. Select File|Open, the application quits.

Case 2) In Finder, select a racket file to open in DrRacket. DrRacket will open, but the file will not load. Select File|Open, then cancel. The file from finder pops up.
