>Description:
Right-clicking on selected text has an item for searching in the
docs.  That entry should be created after removing control characters
(newlines, page feeds, tabs, etc), and trimming it.  Otherwise you
get a weird character when you have just a newline selected, and an
invalid-looking menu entry when you have lots of text selected.
