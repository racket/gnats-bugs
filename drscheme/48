>Description:
I've noticed the following discrepancies with Check Syntax. 
I realize that hilighting syntax is a hard problem, so if some of these
are impossible to fix, feel free to say so.  But they all had surprise
value to me, the naive programmer.

1. illegal syntax (eg, mismatched parens) causes internal error.

2. (quote x) is marked as const (correct), but quasiquote, unquote,
unquote-splicing (spelled out, not tick mark) are unmarked. 

3. 'a and '(a b c) are unmarked.

4. (or 1 2 3) and (and 1 2 3) fail to mark the last element.

5. #&a, #&"hi", #&2 are entirely unmarked (not even the "hi" or 2).

6. local is unmarked, and so is define inside local.

 It's just "define" inside local that's not highlighted.
 begin, lambda, if, etc are all marked as syntax.

 What is this apropos to?  define inside local is a local keyword, not
 a regular Scheme special form.  It is _not_ the same as top-level
 define; it just happens to share a name with it.

>Unformatted:
I have looked at this a bit.  I don't know why some of these happen.
What I can add is:

- local is now fixed; eventually all such "macros" will be fixed.
  They have to be done by hand one-at-a-time, though.

- The keywords inside local are not marked, and probably won't be.
  Nobody's mentioned this in the past two months, so it was probably
  time for it to come up again.  Notice the answer hasn't changed. (-:

- quasiquote, unquote, unquote-splicing may eventually be marked.  It
  doesn't matter whether you write them out or abbreviate them; in
  either case, they are still internal keywords.

- I couldn't find any clues in the output of (or ...) that told me
  what was wrong.  Note that (or), (or 1) and (or 1 2) also don't
  produce the right output.  In each case, the abstract syntax looks
  right, unless I'm missing something (Robby?).
