Subject: error message from thread exception treated as user input

>Number:         6949

>Description:
When a thread raises an exception in DrScheme, the editor
confuses the bug icon and error message as something
entered by the user.  This leads to an annoying error when
the user enters another expression.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a suitable language level, type the following in
the interactions window:

> (thread (lambda () (sleep 1) (/ 1 0)))

Wait until DrScheme reports the division by zero error.
Note that the error message is plain gray and editable,
unlike the italic red it would be if the error arose in
the main thread.  Press Enter.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Mon, 19 Jul 2004 14:31:03 -0400
Reason>>> drscheme

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 19 Jul 2004 15:41:43 -0400
Reason>>> this has been fixed in v299 -- I don't plan to fix it in 20x branch, since
the fix came about by a completely rewrite of the REPL. Sorry...
