>Originator:     julien
>Release:        203
>Organization:
plt
>Environment:
linux-redhat
>Description:
if the buffer contain the following line
(define tordu3 '(a . #0=(b c d . #0#))) 
then the check syntax loops
>How-To-Repeat:
(define tordu3 '(a . #0=(b c d . #0#)))
>Fix:
the bug: in the main syntax-case for check syntax, let-values became
let-value, which means that the code that checks a pattern match in the
let-values case was looping over the input structure.
