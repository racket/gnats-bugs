I installed DrScheme here at SunLabs under Solaris 2.5 with cde (Sun's
official window manager).  The installation went very smoothly.

I have encountered one serious problem in using DrScheme for utility
computations: the printer is very slow.  I wrote a simple program to
generate large boolean formulas to use as test data for my boolean
simplifier.  DrScheme ground to a halt when I tried to print the
complete cnf formula with 8 variables (256 conjunctions).  I didn't
know what was going wrong.  To make sure my code was not at fault, I
eliminated an append operation (by adding an accumulator) to make my
generation algorithm linear in the size of the output.  I expect that
a simple powerset program will produce the same problem on input lists
of length 10 or greater.

I got around the problem by using the explicit print command write/display.

BTW, is there any way to eliminate the escaping backslash in front of
the symbol name "|" in printing lists, short of writing a custom list
printing function?  I used emacs to edit the output to convert "\|" to
"|", but this was an expedient kludge.

I have improved printing some. It is a faster (not fast :) and the value
printer display partial results, like display does.
