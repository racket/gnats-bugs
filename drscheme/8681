>Description:
I just attempted to add a path to the collection path, in the Language...|Choose Language|(module... dialog, and when I clicked the "Choose" button it produced a standard output text window that contained the following message:
append in list-control<%>: expected argument of type <string (up to 200 characters)>; given #<path:/Volumes/Users/andrew/sandbox/foo/collects>

>How-To-Repeat:
On Mac OS-X (if that matters): attempt to add a collection path to the defaults, by sellecting a "collects" directory with the file chooser dialog that pops up.
>Fix:
Turns the path into a string.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. 

It might have been a type error, but only if paths and strings are separate types in the type system (and given our set of primitives, it isn't clear if that's possible).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 18 May 2007 10:20:38 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN. It will be in our next release.

Thanks for the report!
