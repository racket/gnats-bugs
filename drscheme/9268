>Description:
clicking a word will sometimes select a character, causing f1-search-help to fail. 
Specifically, if you happen to click the right-hand side of a character you will select it rather than move the cursor.
If you then press f1, the search will be for the character only. 

This seems to happen enough to be annoying for me, but I don't know if anyone else experiences it as a problem
>How-To-Repeat:
click the right-hand side of a character you will select it 
press f1 (to search for the selected character only)
>Fix:
