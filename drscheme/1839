State-Changed-Why:

this bug is due to a chance in the behavior of the
current-library-collection-paths primitive. In the past, it did not raise
an exception when it got a list of strings. Now it raises an exception if
the list of strings are not complete paths. The fix: give up on testing the
primitive's input and instead just catch any exceptions to display to the
user.
