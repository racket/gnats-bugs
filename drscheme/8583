>Description:
When switching between two tabs, only one of which has
the interactiosn window shown, each tab's definition
window is scrolled by the time you return. One goes up
and the other goes down, I think.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open two tabs in DrScheme with long files.
In one tab, show the interaction window.
Scroll to the middle of each file.
Alternate tabs, and watch for the scroll position
 in each definitions window to change.
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
Same as PR 8851.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 12 Oct 2007 10:18:52 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed and released to SVN.
