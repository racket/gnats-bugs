 Thanks for the bug report.
 
 The parenthesis matcher needs a complete overhaul unfortunately. Things
 like that (and others...) can confuse it. We have this on our
 collective TODO list, but it is a low priority right now.
 
 If you are interested in contributing a parenthesis matcher that would
 be wonderful!
