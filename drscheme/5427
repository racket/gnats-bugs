>Description:
It seems to me that an XML box should not be allowed to
contain an empty Scheme box inside it.
>How-To-Repeat:
In a fresh document, insert an XML box, then type
<head>, and after the open tag, insert a Scheme box
with no contents.  Click Execute.  You get the value

(list 'head empty #<eof>)

Incidentally, if I replace the Scheme box with a
Scheme Splice Box, I get

scheme-splice-box: expected a list, found: #<eof>

when I Execute, with no source location.  But you probably
already know that.

    probably there should have been a contract for read-special
