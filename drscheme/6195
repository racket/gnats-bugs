 What is "read-comment"?

 I defined one: 
 
 (define (read-comment x) "hello world")
 
 But, the one from xml.ss supersedes the one that I refer to in my xml
 box. 
 
 I'll try to re-construct the bug more patiently later.

 Oh! It's a defined variable! That makes much more sense. I was trying
 various kinds of comments in scheme boxes in xml boxes to figure out
 what you meant....
