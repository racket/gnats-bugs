>Description:
	1. open existing file into bew drscheme; i get a new window
	   that used to go into the untouched buffer! It should go there. 

  	2. check syntax still doesn't work: 

	Internal Error: in-parameterization: expects type
	<parameterization> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments
	were: #<primitive:read-case-sensitive>

	That's rather annoying because I downloaded a bundle this afternoon
	for that purpose. 

>How-To-Repeat:
	try the above on the current bundle

I cannot reproduce either of these problems in drscheme -x. Do you have a
sequence of steps that exhibit the problem?

 That code doesn't cause any problems in the currently released -x. Maybe
 something screwed up in the bundle?

 This is the version I downloaded: 
 
    Welcome to DrScheme, version 51/9s1d4.
 
 For syntax check, I put the following text in and clicked on CS:

 (define end-annotation? 
   (mk-annotation (lambda (str E)

 			(eqv? (string-ref str 0) #\<)
 			(eqv? (string-ref str 1) #\/)
 			(eqv? (string-ref str E) #\>)))))
 
 (define (end-annotation ann)
   (if (annotation? ann) 
       (let ((str (symbol->string ann))) 
 	(string->symbol
 	 (string-append "</" (substring str 1 (string-length str)))))
       (error 'end-annotation "not an annotation: ~s" ann)))
 
 (define (write-file  los)

 Check bundle then. Bundle it up, install it on some machine, and fire it
 up. I sued sparc-solaris, not -motif. Ask Matthew whether this does
 anything bad.

 What does "sued" mean in this context?

 There was no problem with the version I bundled. There is no problem with
 the -x version. My only conclusion is that perhaps your bundle had
 problems. Probably you should try again.

 sparc-solais xt is the default for solaris, not -motif.

 If -motif is the default, is it possible that the xt bundle version does
 not pick up the latest release? Please check!!!!

 And in fact, I already did make a bundle and try it. And it worked. It
 worked just fine.
