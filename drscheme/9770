Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme\n"))
>Description:
Enter the program below in the module language, click run
and get two errors.  Trying to change text close to /
inside of the highlighed range pops up an internal error:

  unhighlight-range: range not found; start: 155 end: 158
  color: (red: 255 green: 192 blue: 203) caret-space?: #f
  style: rectangle
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed-scheme

(: check-token (Any Any * -> Boolean))
(define (check-token str . toks)
  (if (null? toks)
      #t
      (and (let ([tok (car toks)])  tok) #t)))
>Fix:
This was a bug in the error checking. If you added the same range twice, it was only added once, so the second removal resulted in a bug. The fix was to record each range multiple times (once per time is was registered), changing an internal hash table so it maps from ranges to lists of integers instead of just integers
>Release-Note:
This was a bug in the contract enforcement itself. It could not have been a type error, but it was a contract violation.
