>Description:
Every time I switch the GUI language,
(for me, between Chinese and English),
and restart DrScheme, the programming language setup is lost. DrScheme says
"No language chosen" and "DrScheme cannot process programs until you choose a programming language.
Either select the “Choose Language...” item in the “Language” menu" ...
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
the bug: drscheme was saving strings in preference that were being
translated, so when the preference file was read back in, in a new language,
the preference was treated as trash and ignored.
>Release-Note:
there was no contract violation here, because bogus preferences are
handled silently whenever possible (in order to cope with corrupted
preference files). I'm not sure this is the best position to take in general,
but it has been important in the past to avoid failing in this case.
