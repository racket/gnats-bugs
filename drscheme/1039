>Environment:
Linux
>Description:
Every time I select "New" in DrScheme, I get a window named
"Untitled". Thus, if I select "New" five times, I get five "Untitled"s
in my "Windows" menu (and my icon bar), making it difficult to switch
among them.

The first window should be "Untitled". The second should be "Untitled
2", etc.

>How-To-Repeat:
Select "New" in DrScheme's window five times
Look at the "Windows" menu

>Fix:
