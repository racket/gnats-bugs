 The interactios window is not frozen for me. Hit backspace and go fix
 the expression!
 
 But I think you've reported this behavior before as a bug, so maybe it
 is time to think about some slightly different behavior that will be
 less surprising somehow?

 Or maybe the teaching languages should have a less forgiving
 interactions window, ie one that treats any return (when the cursor
 position is followed only by whitespace) as an attempt to submit an
 expression?
 
 Would that have done the trick?

 Given how we suggest beginners deal with the repl, this might work.=20
 But honestly, I can see more pressing work to be done.=20

 That seems way too strict to me: it outlaws
 (list 'this
         'is
         'a
         'test)
 
 I think the criterion should be "is what the user has typed so far  
 POSSIBLY a PREFIX of a legal expression?"  If there are already more  
 right than left parentheses, the answer is "no", so it should be  
 flagged as an error.
 
 In recent memory, DrScheme has displayed three different behaviors  
 when faced with this kind of input:
 
 1) evaluate each of the expressions on the line in turn from left to  
 right, and then complain about the unmatched right-parenthesis when  
 it gets to it;
 2) complain immediately, without evaluating anything;
 3) sit there and wait for you to figure out on your own why nothing  
 is happening.
 
 I respectfully submit that #3 is the least beginner-friendly of the  
 three :-)  I could go with either of the others.

 Honestly, when I put in the bug report I had forgotten that I had  
 already complained about this behavior.  It looked to me (and, more  
 importantly, would look to a rank-beginner student) as though the  
 Interactions pane was frozen.

 FWIW, this would have been a trivial fix.
 
 But I agree with Stephen that it would be a bad idea.
 
 Do the studies from WPI suggest anything (or tell us if this a more
 universal problem)?
