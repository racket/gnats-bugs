 Did you consider adding this yourself? I think it is doable with what
 you have.

 The scheme:text (and/or text:color) methods should tell you if you're
 in a comment, as well as where matching parenthesis are.
 
 I guess you'd start with the keybindings stuff, tho. The starter docs
 for that are in the drscheme manual.
 
 hth,

 Okay, I'll take a look.

 Just to double check: you do know that there are word-by-word
 keybindings already, right? Just not one key that does both in a
 context sensitive manner?

 Actually no. I see now that ctrl+right-arrow works.

 I will still try see if I can figure out to do it in a context
 sensitive way - the alt-arrow combination is still in my
 fingers from the Emacs days.
 
 And now I know there is code to steal...

 And now I know there is code to steal...
 
 ... ideas from ;-)
 
 
 At
 
 <http://pre.plt-scheme.org/docs/html/drscheme/drscheme-Z-H-3.html#node_sec_3.3.7>
 
 it says that keybinding-proc-expr in
 
      (keybinding keybinding-string-expr keybinding-proc-expr)
 
 should a suitable second argument for add-function in keymap%.
 
 And in the section on add-function it says that it
 will receive an "arbitrary" value and an event% object. It also
 says that for keymaps associated with an editor, the "arbitrary"
 value will be the target editor.
 
 What kind of editor can code evaluated through the "Add User-defined
 keybindings" expect to receive? A scheme% editor?

 It can expect to receive whatever editor the keybinding is pressed in.
 Interactions is a drscheme:rep:text and definitions is
 drscheme:unit:text.
 
 Those both have the scheme:text mixin mixed in.

 PS: but the scheme:text's paren matching stuff will only work after the
 last prompt (I think the relevant method is reset-region) in the
 interactions window.
