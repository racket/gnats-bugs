 What should the answer be? Like `write'? Or an error?
 
 The docs for write-special have a typo: "if it support special writes".
 Probably should be "supports".

 Like `write' (well, `print') makes sense to me.

 print seems more difficult, since I have to call untrusted code to get
 the string, but I'll look into it.

 Ok, `write' seems fine. It really doesn't matter, I think.

 What wasn't clear from the docs (at least to me) is the contract on
 write-special. Is it supposed to work for all values if it works for
 any values?

 Yes, that's the intent.

 Is it safe to convert the value (via format, I suppose) to a string on
 the same thread that the user calls `write-special' on? That is, the
 write-special proc on the port? It seems like it should be. this might
 also make for a safe way to use `print'?
