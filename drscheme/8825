>Description:
I have a workshop participant's code fragment that does not indent in response to tab or reindent-all.  The code was originally written in 370p1 under MscOS.  I tried the file on my WinXP (also 370p1) and didn't get it to indent either.  Code fragment is below, and I can forward the actual file to whoever claims the bug.  Note fragment does indent if the (cond is on a line by itself.
>How-To-Repeat:
; a list-of-number is
; - (cons number empty), or  (i.e. a one-item list)
; - (cons number list-of-number)

; largest-of : list-of-number max -> number
; finds the largest number in a list

#| Template

 Strangely enough, this works properly for me. I opened a new drscheme,
 pasted the code from the PR, selected all, and hit tab, and got the
 proper indentation. I then did undo and hit command-i (indent all) and
 also got the proper indentation.
 
 Any other hints?
 
 Thanks,

 Kathy: when I hit tab with the Scheme code in this PR, but in profj, I got this:
 
 <=: expects type <real number> as 2nd argument, given: #f; other
 arguments were: 417

 I don't recall what the code in question even was here.  I'm guessing
 I ran into this while prepping the latest workshops, but I don't
 remember other details.  Sorry.

 I've attached the original file.  I still get the non-indenting
 behavior reported in the PR.

 Aha! The problem is that there is a tab in there, not a space. The
 tabber apprently has the wrong semantics for tabs. Here's a shorter
 example:
 
 (fghij	1
               2)
 
 Where the whitespace between "fghij" and "1" is a single tab
 character. This causes the next line to indent to the wrong place.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Okay, I'm about to check in a fix. It doesn't count characters now,
 but instead find the position of the start and end, and then their
 locations, and then the width of the letter "x" and then does the
 expected division to find out how many spaces to insert. This seems
 like a generalization of what worked before and, given that tabs can
 be specified in graphical locations, a reasonable approximation to the
 truth.
