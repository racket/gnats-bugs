>Description:
Search in Files seems to miss many hits.  Here's the grep output of
searching for 'gen-match' in the plt/collects/mzlib directory:

[osterley:~/plt/collects/mzlib] clements% find . -exec grep -H 'gen-match' {} \;
grep: .: Is a directory
Binary file ./#plt-match.ss#1# matches

./match.ss:                   (gen-match (syntax the-exp)

./private/plt-match/match-inc.scm:    (define gen-match-opt
[osterley:~/plt/collects/mzlib] clements% 

DrScheme produces only four hits:

    match.ss:               (let-values (((stx t rt gc) (time-apply gen-match 
plt-match.ss:                    (gen-match (syntax the-exp)
plt-match.ss:                    (gen-match (syntax the-exp);(syntax (list exp ...))
plt-match.ss:             (let ((x exp)) #,(gen-match (syntax x)

Note that it's not just a question of finding the right files.  In the file
match.ss, for instance, DrScheme finds one hit, rather than four.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme, choose Search in Files...
Enter the path for collects/mzlib, select "search in subdirs", enter
search text gen-match.
Click okay.
>Fix:
I rewrote the threading aspects of the searcher to
use the new cmz libraries in mzscheme.

 I tried to use it yesterday on one of the machines and it didn't work.
 Sorry, no reproduction ...

 If of any help, can confirm that on OSX (at least), search only
 finds 1 of 4 "gen-match" search string instances within match.ss,
 for some reason.
