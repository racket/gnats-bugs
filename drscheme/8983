 This seems like a bad installation of DrScheme -- would you agree?
 
 I don't know how this can happen, otherwise.

 It seems like something is wrong with your installation of DrScheme.
 I'm not sure what that could be, however. Do you have other
 installations of DrScheme on that machine? Did you set any environment
 variables?
 
 [ Eli, Matthew: any ideas? ]
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 (I just sent this with bad headers, so here it is again)
 
 JFYI, the "Thank you ..." email for this PR bounced back, so it's
 unlikely to get any further details.

 It said:
 
   <felges@c13-ss-2-lb.cnet.com>... Deferred: Connection timed out with c13-ss-2-lb.cnet.com.
   Warning: message still undelivered after 4 hours
   Will keep trying until message is 5 days old
 
 So maybe it will go through eventually.
