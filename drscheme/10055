>Description:
When you search for a word, it's possible for the only search result to appear underneath the floating "#lang scheme" bar. When that happens, clicking "next" and "prev" won't move your buffer, but the match to your search doesn't actually appear on your screen. This could potentially make you unhappy. I request that this behavior be changed so that DrScheme doesn't count your word as being onscreen if it's covered.
