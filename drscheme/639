>Description:

	After CheckSyntax + alpha-renaming, DrScheme becomes semi-active. 
	The Definitions window no longer show where teh cursor is but I can
	still Execute and occasionally I was able to edit but the edits
	wouldn't show up!

>How-To-Repeat:

1.	load the following code: 

(define (payment-plus transactions balance rate last-date current-date)
  (cond
    ((null? transactions)
     (pay-for (date-minus current-date last-date) balance rate))
    (else (let* ((d/w (first transactions))
		 (new-date (dw-date d/w))
		 (amount   (dw-amount d/w))) 
	    (+ (pay-for (date-minus new-date last-date) balance rate)
	       (payment-plus (rest transactions) 
			     (+ balance amount) 
			     rate 
			     new-date 
			     current-date))))))

2. CheckSyntax

3. Place cursor on last-date so arrows show up 

4. Ask for rename with right mouse button

5. Type in some new name and hit <return>

Result: An internal Zodiac error box shows up; click ok; then you're
hosed. Works w/o fail everytime I do it.
