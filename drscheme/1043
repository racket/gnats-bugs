>Description:
The test procedure "test:mouse-click" in the framework doesn't work. Here's the error message:

ivar: instance variable not found: set-event-object in class: $$mouse-event%
  (#%ivar/proc event (#%quote set-event-object)) in Barbican:plt:collects:framework:testr.ss

  (#%begin (begin-action) (pass-errors-out thunk) (end-action)) in Barbican:plt:collects:framework:testr.ss

>How-To-Repeat:
no obvious short sequence.  Here's the program, though you have to put it in somewhere where test functions work:

(test:mouse-click 'left 30 30)

State-Changed-Why:

this has been fixed, a while ago. But, here is how you would reproduce such
a bug, in Scheme code (you will need to do this kind of thing to write a
test suite in general....). Put the following code in a file named
filename.ss and start mred with "-f filename.ss":

  (class canvas% args
    (override
     [on-event
      (lambda x
	(printf "x: ~s~n" x))])
    (sequence
      (apply super-init args))))


(define f (make-object frame% "frame" #f 300 300))
(make-object cnvs% f)
(send f show #t)

(require-library "framework.ss" "framework")

;; need to run test suite in a thread that _isn't_ the eventspace's thread.
(thread
 (lambda ()
   (begin
     (printf "before~n")
     (test:mouse-click 'left 30 30)
     (printf "after~n"))))

(yield (make-semaphore)) ;; so console doesn't appear
