>Description:
I usually run DrRacket in #lang mode, but sometimes have to go into, say, an HtDP language to check something or answer a question.

Because my default is not #lang racket but something else and much longer (e.g., #lang planet cs019/cs019), it'd be real nice to not have to type that repeatly.

However, when I switch back to #lang, it has forgotten my default #lang choice.  This is a heavy penalty to pay for a one-minute incursion into a HtDP language. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to Language | Choose Language ... Show Details.
Select, say, typed/racket as the #lang default.
Now go again to the menu and choose Beginning Student.
Go again to the menu and choose #lang and Show Details.
The Automatic #lang line is back to "#lang racket".

 The patch is a good example of why getters and setters are a nice idea!

 Not really. It was private to the module all along so the usual benefit
 doesn't apply here. And usually just using a getter like I did here is not
 enough as you also have to make sure that the getter is called at the right
 time (when I was changing this I felt lucky that the variable references
 happened to be in just the right places for the calls to the getter).

 Maybe in this particular example the privacy helps, but you'd still
 only need to (a) define the getter, and (b) set it in the right place.
 The plumbing could be left alone:
 
 -           default-auto-text
 +           (get-default-auto-text)
 
 -                                         default-auto-text
 +                                         (get-default-auto-text)
 
 -    (install-auto-text default-auto-text)
 +    (install-auto-text (get-default-auto-text))

 But this is totally trivial!
