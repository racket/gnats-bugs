>Description:
On startup, DrScheme reports

  invoke-open-unit/sig: invoke unit imports 0 units, but 1 units were provided

and startup is aborted (an EdJr window is opened).

Everything was working fine for weeks.  Perhaps it's coincidence,
but maybe the stuff I was working on somehow corrupted DrScheme
(none of the DrScheme files have been recently modified, however).

The two notable things I did recently were 
  - Select a library (mred/collects/graphics/graphicr.ss)
  - Experiment with using draw-string for various fonts.
    The fonts were constructed using (make-object wx:font% ...)

After I did this, I exited DrScheme and restarted (to verify that
my code would work without selecting the graphicr.ss library),
which is when the error occurred. 

I'm now unable to run DrScheme at all.  I'm going to try reinstalling
it to see if that solves the problem.

 Probably you just want to delete your .mred.prefs, rather than re-install.
 
 If deleteing your .mred.prefs works, please send me the code in the
 library.
 
 Thanks,

 It did that because you selected that as a library. That file does not meet 
 the specifications of a library. In fact, those functions are already
 available in drscheme without specificing a library.
