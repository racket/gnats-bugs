>Description:
Check-syntax does not properly understand the 
(lambda (named-arg . rest) ...) form of lambda. It does not color
any of the lambda's variables in the formals or the body 
expression, as it does in the (lambda (arg) ...) and 
(lambda arg ...) forms.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Drscheme's definitions window, type:

(lambda (a . b) (map a b))

Click "check-syntax." Notice that it will not paint arrows from
the variable declarations in the formals to their uses in the
body.

State-Changed-Why:

Fixed. The bug was that I used syntax-object->list where I should have used
a variant on that function that works on improper lists.

This couldn't have been caught by a contract checker.
