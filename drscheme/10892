>Description:
After filling out the bug report form in DrRacket, when trying to submit it, I got the following error message:

sequence-contract-violation: negative: method set-paragraph-margins cannot be called, except in states (unlocked), args 6 28 28 28
>How-To-Repeat:
Fill a bug report from DrRacket, then try to send it.

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 25 Dec 2010 21:52:08 -0500

easily lead to this message that I've recently fixed, so I'm
going to close this PR on the assumption that that fixed
this bug....
