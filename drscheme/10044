>Description:
Given the amount of my (and Casey's) code involved here, it's far from clear
that this is your bug, but here goes: when I use an emacs-style keyboard 
macro in conjunction with a user keybindings file that sends a "call-
function" message to the keymap, I get two error dialogs.  The first one 
says "hey, you forgot to call end-edit-sequence." The second is an internal 
error that says, "hey, you can't call end-edit sequence here!" So... these 
error messages would seem to cancel out, if only I could figure out how.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add this user keybindings file:

(module jbc-keybindings framework/keybinding-lang
  (keybinding 
   "~c:s:\""
   (lambda (editor event)
     (send
      (send editor get-keymap)
      call-function
      "insert-\"\"-pair"
      editor event #t)))
  )

Now restart, and in a fresh buffer, issue this sequence of commands:

c:x;(   ;; to start an emacs macro
"       ;; to introduce a *pair* of quotes
c:x;)   ;; to end the macro
c:x;c:e ;; to use the macro

Get two errors, the first with this text:

Error running keybinding ...c-keybindings.ss:29:3

Editor left in edit-sequence

... and the second with this text:

sequence-contract-violation: negative: method end-edit-sequence cannot be called, except in states (in-edit-sequence)

 Well, the second error sure looks like it is a bug in the code around
 line 56 in framework/keybinding-lang.ss, but I sure don't see it by
 code inspection. It somehow seems unlikely to be a bug in the contract
 checking, since edit sequences are used all over the place.
 
 Patches welcome. :)
