>Description:
Put the following program in the buffer:

(module m mzscheme
  (define X 1)
  (provide X)
  (provide (all-defined-except X)))

Hit Check Syntax.

Note that there is an arrow between the first two X's, but not to the 3rd X.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
Added a case to check syntax for all-defined-except.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract error, but might have been an ML type error, depending on how the data structure for provides would have changed.
