>Description:
When a program prints both to current-output-port and
current-error-port, all of the output prints are together
in a box and all of the error prints are together after
the box (assuming the first print is to output).
>How-To-Repeat:
> (begin
    (printf "1~n")
    (fprintf (current-error-port) "2~n")
    (printf "3~n"))
; Shows 1 and 3 in a box, then 2 outside the box
