>Description:
Looks like C-Left searches only the previous line.
In the definitions window enter this program (each
line that begins with a "|" is a line that should
be entered, with the empty lines.

  |0
  |
  |
  |

C-left works only when on the second line.

Possibly related, enter this program:

  |0
  |;;
  |
  |

and place the cursor on the third line, no hit
C-left and you get to between the two semicolons.

BTW, this is not a scheme-mode problem -- I see
the same behavior with C-left in the bug dialog
fields.
