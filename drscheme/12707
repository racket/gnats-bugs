>Description:
On Windows alt-tab cycles through the active tasks in order from most recently used to least recently used.

Please change ctrl-tab to cycle through the active tabs in a DrRacket window in the same order (from most recently used to least recently used). The 'next tab/previous tab' functionality is already given (currently duplicated) with ctrl-shft-[ and ctrl-shft-].

Changing ctrl-tab to mimic Windows (and Textpad et al) enables you to edit in one file, quickly switch to another for reference, and perhaps copying into the clipboard buffer, etc., and then quickly switching back to the file being first file for further editing.

 Note also that in Windows ctrl-tab cycles through the list in MRU->LRU
 order and ctrl-shft-tab cycles through the list in the reverse (LRU->MRU)
 order.

 Is this knowledge coming from some windows UI guidelines, or from
 experience with some apps? (If the latter, which ones?)
 
 Thanks,

 (FWIW, when I saw this I tried the three major browsers, and random
 dialog boxes; all went left to right.  It sounds like a cute option,
 but doesn't look standard.  I do like to reorder tabs quickly with
 drag and drop to make such navigation easier for related tabs.)

 alt-tab & alt-shft-tab cycle through open windows LRU->MRU on all versions of windows since 3 (not ctrl-tab as previously stated).
 
 The editor I have used for years is textpad and it cycles through the open tabs MRU->LRU with ctrl-tab and ctrl-shft-tab. Others do also but I can't test right now. 
 
 I was very disappointed when Firefox choose L->R cycle when it first supported tabs - would love it if MRU->LRU could be an option there.
 
 Didn't think to try dragging tabs around in DrRacket - doh! Thanks for the tip.

 (Yeah, I know about alt, of course -- but I've never used textpad, and
 I was surprised to hear about it since I've never heard about anything
 that does that.)
