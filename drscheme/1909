 This seems to be fine in DrScheme as well. Perhaps you want to use the
 Full Scheme language level. If not, this program works equally well in
 Beginner Scheme:
 
 (define build
   (lambda (n)
     (cond
       ((> n 0)(cons 'x (build (- n 1))))
        (( = n  0 )  empty)
        (#t (error "build fail"))
        )))
 
 In the future, you may wish to consult the documentation in DrScheme
 (in Help Desk, as a separate app distributed with DrScheme, also
 available from the help menu). 
 
 MIT Scheme is not our metric for correct behavior.
 
 Thanks for your interest.
 
 Robby

 are you saying that you are running drscheme in beginner scheme and it
 complains about '() not being a symbol? 
 
 beginner scheme isn't mit scheme or r4rs. please raise your language
 level.
