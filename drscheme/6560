 Please be more specific (please consider this a general request :).
 
 In this case, your description is not enough to reproduce the bug. In
 particular, this program:
 
   (write "hi\n")
 
 in advanced works fine as an executable (on my mac).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 This program produces the very same bug as my large one.
 
 You forgot a piece of the context: the draw.ss teachpack.
