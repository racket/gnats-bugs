>Description:
from SK.
>How-To-Repeat:
Beginner, Win2k, build from tonight.

Definitions window:

(define (square n)
  (* n n))

(define (hypotenuse ln ht)
  (sqrt (+ (square ln)
           (square ht))))

Click Execute.  The two definition lines, and corresponding close
parens, are black; the two body expressions are red.

In the REPL:

> (square 5)

Expression is colored.
Answer, and body of SQUARE turns black (so the whole def is black).

> (hypotenuse 5 12)

Expression is black.  Body of HYPOTENUSE stays red.  Entering the same
expression, same outcome: the REPL expression is still black, the body
is still red.

In contrast, in this sequence:

> (square 5)            <-- colored
> (square 12)           <-- black
> (hypotenuse 5 12)     <-- colored
> (hypotenuse 5 12)     <-- colored

In a fresh REPL, entering

> (hypotenuse 5 12)

produces the right answer but both the bodies of SQUARE and of
HYPOTENUSE remain red.  (The expression is colored.)  Subsequently
running

> (square 5)

doesn't affect the color of the body of SQUARE.
>Fix:
The bug: the test to decide if highlighting should be shown
in the definitions window at all was "is there any code that would
be red?". So, if you run the program and there is some red, but
you then subsequently run an interaction that would turn everything
black, this test (errorneously) decided not to do any coloring.

Now, the test is more like "Has the buffer been colored since the
last execute *or* is there anything that would be red?"

There is no contract violation I can see here.
