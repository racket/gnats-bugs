 The low-tech hack is just to not quit you drracket until you get back
 online (leaving the windows open). Or, if you're worried about
 drracket crashing, you could start up a separate one just to hold onto
 the bug reports. Or, you could just put them into a regular file and
 copy and paste them into the form when you get back online .... is any
 of that too unworkable to justify adding this feature?

 I have done all this for years. Every time I do it, I remember
 (1) files I forgot to turn into bug reports (2) drracket's that=20
 force-quit or crashed with the bug report still open and (3)
 similar things. Every time I want to file a report that a small
 addition could help .. So now I did :-)=20

 The forgetting files thing suggests that drracket should be saving the
 partial bug reports somewhere for you, not asking you to pick a place
 and remember it, right?

 I'm not online completely yet, but did you try to submit a test report
 to make sure that everything works fine re the information sent out?
