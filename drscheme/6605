>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
Go to Edit:Search in files...
I then type in a directory to search.
- If I don't select "recur over subdirectories", I get an internal error: 
  procedure build-flat-file-list: expects 1 argument, given 2: "/Users/ian/Src/Collects/Ian" #f
- Even when I do select "recur over subdirectories", it'll find matches deeper down, but
  but not those directories immediately within the directory.

Apologies if this has already been fixed between 205 and 205.9.

(Hey wow, just noticed the feature of clicking
in the mred internal-error-dialog,
and the menu option "copy message into clipboard",
exactly what I wanted!)

 Hey Ian, Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.
 
 Yes, indeed search in files has been fixed since v205, and the first  
 problem you mentioned has gone away. The other, however:
 
  > Even when I do select "recur over subdirectories", it'll find matches  
 deeper down, but
  > but not those directories immediately within the directory.
 
 I can't seem to reproduce. For instance, I can find "Kathi" in  
 plt/collects/drscheme/ack.ss even when the search directory is  
 plt/collects/drscheme.
 
 This is a ptr to the pr, for reference:

 trail&pr=6605&database=plt
 
 Thanks for the report!
 
 Robby
