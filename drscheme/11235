>Description:
There is an inconsistency in the way scenes crop their contents.
On the NW edges, the contents cover the border, on the SE edges,
the border covers the contents.

A program that demonstrates the issue is below.

(I think the right behavior is to have the border always crop
the contents, i.e. the SE behavior is the right one.)

;; This program rotates a white rectangle around an empty scene.
;; You can observe the intersection of the rectangle and the
;; North and West border, but not the East and South.
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)
(define rocket (rectangle 50 100 "solid" "white"))

(define (degree->radian d)

(define (render t)

 It's consistent, that's the most important thing (and fixes what I 
 consider the bug).
 
 As a feature request: I do think animations would look better if the 
 black border were always visible.
 
 Thanks for the fix!

 In case it wasn't clear, the black border is something that you're
 putting in there yourself (by calling empty-scene); it isn't put in by
 the system.
 
 Also, just in case you haven't already, you might want to read this
 section of the 2htdp/image docs:
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/teachpack/2htdpimage.html#(part._nit=
 ty-gritty)
