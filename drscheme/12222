>Description:
In the Show Details menu for language selection, the Automatic #lang
line buffer's editor doesn't respect the "Emacs mode" setting in
Preferences.  Furthermore, not all keys work: C-a selects all, C-v
pastes, but C-c does not copy, instead it switches modes in the
language selection menu.

It would be far preferable if this editor respected the preferences,
so people used to Emacs bindings could continue to use them here.

[I guess I notice this since I have to edit in this buffer frequently
-- often more than once a day.]
