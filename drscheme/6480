>Description:
So you all have got the emacs keystrokes.  How about another 
great emacs feature -- classic black backgrounds.

If no one has any time to do this, please send me an email.  
I'll hack it in if I have to, but it would take me a decent 
minute to figure out how to add a new preference properly 
on an alien codebase.

>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.  Edit -> Preferences.  Voila ;)
