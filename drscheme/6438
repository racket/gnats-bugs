>How-To-Repeat:
paste the above class into a 
drscheme using the default font 

the indentation under the let is wrong and off

i must admit that i also don't like the choice of a 
variable width font for programming as the 
default.

 Wait -- how did you get a variable width font? That shouldn't be.

 That's the default that comes up after installing 205.2.
 I never had a font like this before.
 
 Something else that changed is the file selection menu. It's behaving
 in a strange and irrational way.

 What is the file selection menu? Do you mean the dialog box you get
 after choosing the "file open" menu?
 
 I don't see the funny fonts in 205.2 (today's version). Can you send a
 screen shot? Also, perhaps try deleting any of your preferences that
 have the word "font" in them (be sure you get them all -- the name has
 changed over the centuries and you want to be sure you delete the one
 that affects the current version of drs) and restarting drs.

 Will try. Still it's like the other default thingie that took us by 
 surprise.
 
 Yes, I mean the dialog box that comes up with File | Open,
 Language | Add teachpack, etc. They all used to have
 certain defaults that are now gone. You always start at
 the top.

 It's tough for me to reproduce such things. Maybe if I knew what date
 you'd last updated (it was reported in the welcome to drscheme line of
 the repl, but I doubt you recall -- the version number is probably too
 gross of an approximation, since that's Matthew's release schedule and
 mine is totally independent)

 I believe it should have an app-specific default; ie if you open a file
 in drscheme and then quit and restart drscheme you'll be in that
 directory (same for word, etc).
 
 Still, I seem to recall that mred never really did that. I'm not sure
 if that's a responsibility of Scheme code or of the os, tho. Matthew?
 
 Meanwhile, I almost never use that dialog; I suppose if you're adding
 teachpacks, you cannot get around it, but for file|open, the shell
 command "open" works much better.
 
 For teachpacks, I always use the home and desktop shortcuts (cmd-h and
 cmd-d) to get me started.

 The file dialogs seemed to behave like you describe,
 in an app-specific independent manner. They dont do
 so anymore.
 
 I know how to work around the problem.
