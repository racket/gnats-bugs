>Description:
When used with SML, check syntax raise vector index out of bound error.

"#lang sml" invokes the SML reader, which gengerate a syntax-object. To help deguging, you can call read / read-syntax on a file start with "#lang sml" to get the output of the reader.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Install SML from http://www.cs.utah.edu/~czhu/sml.htm
2. In interaction window:
#lang sml
structure foo =
struct
val x = 1
val y = 2
end

3. Check-syntax
>Fix:
There were some non-original bindings that were being added to the internal id maps.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. It was not a type error, unless the syntax system would have original syntax objects being a different type than non-original syntax objects.

 While I'll agree this is probably a bug in check syntax, I doubt I'll
 make much progress on it until I have a reasonably sized test case
 ...
 
 Thanks,

 I already asked Chongkai for this. Here was his reply:

 I consider this reply completely unprofessional (indeed the entire bug
 report is unprofessional to begin with) and have (already) lost my
 patience to help him.
 
 Impossible indeed.

 Can't you make a smaller test case to demonstrate the problem? This is
 too much.
 
 I see that you have a fairly small ML program as input, so I would
 think that you could cut out a lot of the intermediate code, and get to
 a small reader/expander.

 I can do the debug on my own.
 
 With some adjustment in my code, the error message now is:
 
 -: expects type <number> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: 1
 
 The code generate this message is normally (- (syntax-position stx) 1).
 
 The reader does produce some identifies with syntax-position #f (those 
 that doesn't show up in ML code), but they all have syntax-original? #f. 
 Seems that syntax-original? is not tested for quite many cases. Is this 
 intended?
 
 Thanks,
 Chongkai

 I was never very clear on the connection between syntax-original? and
 the values of things like syntax-position, but that seems like a bug
 in check syntax.
 
 I'd still love an example. Debugging things without producing test
 cases isn't a good use of time, as I'm sure you well know!
