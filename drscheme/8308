>Description:
There doesn't seem to be any way to override the ctrl-; keybinding for the preferences dialog. Not only that, it seems to be activated on ctrl-alt-; as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Demonstration 1:
1. Highlight some code and type ctrl-alt-;

Rather than the code being commented out, the preferences window comes up.

Demonstration 2:

1. Create a keybinding module my-keys, containing the following:

(module my-keys
  (lib "keybinding-lang.ss" "framework")

  (require (lib "scheme.ss"
                "framework/private"))

  (keybinding "c:semicolon"
              (lambda (editor event)
                (send editor insert
                  (make-object string-snip%
                               ";"))))
)

2. Add this keybinding module using the
   Edit-> Keybindings -> Add User-Defined ..
   option

Now, rather than ctrl-; producing a semicolon, the preferences dialog is still activated.

 I've just realized that this has to do somehow with menu keybindings. When
 those are turned off then everything is back to normal. Of couse, though,
 life is harder with menu keybindings turned off..

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Mon, 16 Oct 2006 23:17:49 -0400
Reason>>> Looks like DrScheme, but maybe it is a MrEd issue?


State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 28 Sep 2011 15:13:38 -0400
Reason>>> 

This seems to have been fixed somewhere alon the way; it
works in the latest pre-release from git, anyways.
