Looking at my preference file, I see a very long list in
`plt:framework-pref:drracket:console-previous-exprs'.  I'm
not sure about it, but it looks like an easy fix -- the
code in "drracket/private/main.rkt" uses `drscheme' instead
of `drracket'.

And as long as I'm looking at it -- keeping only 30 entries
seems very short.

 I think you misunderstand that code. It is there because old versions
 of DrRacket didn't trim that entry and this problem means that the
 peformance of DrRacket suffered (a lot). That has nothing to do with
 how current versions of DrRacket save this preference.
 
 (Or maybe you do understand it and there is a bug?)

 OK.  (And BTW, since the name of that configuration is different,
 isn't it time to remove that code?)

 I don't know -- something looks wrong.  I now have 2500 entries in
 that list, and it doesn't seem to shrink.

 The code is there in case people were using the old version and then
 switch to the new version and then experience horrible performance. I
 don't see a need to remove it.

 Looks to me like the limit is 10,000 characters or something like
 that. IIRC, Casey (possibly with me) determined this empirically to be
 a number that wasn't too bad.
 
 But you can see in yours. Open DrRacket, wave your mouse around next
 to the amount of memory in the bottom right of the window. You should
 see a "P" on a blue background appear. Click it and see if the time
 under the "setting a preference" line is something non-trivial.

 But if you switch to a new version, and there's a different piece of
 code that trims it, then there's no need for this trimming to happen
 too.

 Trimming based on characters sounds weird to me.  I don't think that
 I've seen any history mechanism that does that (in readline, emacs,
 and various shells).  It might be that I'm under that limit since I
 obviously just iterated over entering a single character input over
 and over.  If that's the case then consider it a feature request to
 add a maximum numer of history items in addition to this maximum size
 requirement.

 The byte count for it is shown as bigger than 10k:
 
   preferences taking the most space:
     plt:framework-pref:drracket:console-previous-exprs (16059 bytes)

 Sorry-- I left out a question mark or something.
 
 But I assume you're confirming that it doesn't take a long time.
 
 In other words, there is no actual problem anywhere as far as I
 understand this conversation.

 No, that is incorrect. Look: the point is that an old version can have
 a VERY long list. This VERY long list will make a current version
 fail. So the current version trims the OLD version's long list.
 
 It is an unlikely situation nowadays, but it rendered Casey's DrRacket
 completely unusable.

 Well, this is what we determined caused performance problems, so
 that's how we trim.

 Yes, yes. It isn't the same kind of counting.

 Then it sounds like the code that trims the new version is the wrong
 place, possibly only when saving it instead of after it loads it to
 make sure that it's always under the limit.  (IOW, you might get long
 lists for a long-running drr session.)

 I'm not asking to change it -- I'm asking to further restrict it by a
 number-of-entries.
 
 But another possible problem with using a total size quota: do the
 mistake of pasting a sufficiently piece of text -- and your history
 vanishes.  I just tried it, and ineed that wiped my history.  So maybe
 it's better to filter out long entries (and use a number of entries
 which would be the only thing needed).

 No, it doesn't take a long time.  My issue started since I needed to
 manually edit the file for a different entry and to my surprise I saw
 that most of the file is that history.

 I don't agree. The trimming happens when the preference is saved and
 the timing of when to save the preference in the presence of multiple
 REPLs was something that we spent a while hammering out. This is a
 completely different issue.

 On further playing with it, I indeed misunderstood things.  I verified
 that if I have a long entry for `...:drscheme:console-previous-exprs'
 then it does get trimmed to 30 values, but it's never actually used.
 So if this is done just to keep the preferences file at a small size,
 then why do it just of this?  The question here is whether the prefs
 are something that only code in the tree should deal with or whether
 it's open.
 
 More practically for drracket, it looks like a better approach is to
 just pop up a warning dialog and pending user approval delete all of
 the old `...:drscheme:...' entries (and if it's not approved, add a
 preference that remembers this to avoid repeated nagging).

 OK, I'll send a patch.
