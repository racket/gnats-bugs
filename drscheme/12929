>Description:
When adding comments to code in DrRacket, particularly when deleting text in comment, DrRacket frequently crashes. This occurs very frequently, perhaps 50% of the time during the above activity.

I am using Windows7 pro 64bit, SSD with rkt file on normal HDD, Core i5-3550, 4Gb of RAM. Same problem does occur with rkt file on SSD itself however.

Occurs regardless of what other programs are active in the background.

I note that when I use a different computer (Windows XP 32bit, no SSD) this problem never occurs.
>How-To-Repeat:
1st scenario: Write a comment for a line of code (sometimes does it)

2nd scenario: Write a comment for a line of code, delete part of it, then start typing again.
>Fix:
