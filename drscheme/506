	The current directory is not set properly during elaboration
while loading a file.

>How-To-Repeat:

Put this in a file in a different directory than your current
directory, then load/cd it. All the directory names should be the
same.

(printf "clrd: ~a~n" (current-load-relative-directory)) 
(printf "cd: ~a~n" (current-directory)) 

(define-macro mmm
  (lambda ()
    `'(,(current-load-relative-directory)
       ,(current-directory))))

(printf "expanding: ~a~n" (mmm))

Note: DrScheme Jr currently does not pass the unitsig.ss test suite if
it is run with `load' (from a directory other than the test
directory). DrScheme doesn't pass when load/cd is used.

Here is an example of the bug that doesn't use files. It relies on the fact 
that the current-directory is different than "/tmp". It either evaluates to 
the symbol 'test-passed or a list with some info about the failure.

(define-macro m (lambda () (current-directory)))

(let ([cd (current-directory)])
  (when (string=? cd "/tmp") (error 'test-cannot-be-run-in-/tmp))
  (current-directory "/tmp")
  (let ([res-m (eval '(m))]
	[res-d (current-directory)])
    (begin0 (if (string=? res-m res-d)
		'test-passed
		(list 'test-failed res-m res-d))
	    (current-directory cd))))

; --

Also, this is a good test:

(define-macro mt (lambda () (current-thread)))
(if (eq? (mt) (current-thread)) 'test-passed 'test-failed)

It currently passes, tho.
