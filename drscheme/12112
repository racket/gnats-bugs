>Description:
There was an error in 5.0.1 where if you tried to start up a second DrRacket with one already running, it warned you about the lock on the prefs file and did you want to steal it; if you clicked Cancel, it proceeded to try to get it anyway (?) and resulted in an Internal Error.

The good news is that that behavior no longer happens on 5.1.2.  But the bad news is you can't start up the second DrRacket at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
ventoux ~/Desktop/Plt> drracket &
[1] 4496  ## <-- succeeds
ventoux ~/Desktop/Plt> drracket &
[2] 2684  ## <-- produces the following output to the shell; same output both times; then the second process is done
