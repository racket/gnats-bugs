State-Changed-Why:

I cannot reject the bad preference at drscheme startup (so drscheme will
have this "badfont" in the definitions window) without searching for all of
the fixed with fonts on every startup of drscheme. So, I only reject the
preference when the preferences dialog is opened. I hope that this is
satisfactory.
