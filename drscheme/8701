>Description:
The extra regexps for customizing indentation don't show up the first time the preferences frame is shown. The text entries beside the "Extra regexp" labels are empty. They do show up if the preferences frame is closed and reopened.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter something in the regexp fields, save the preferences, and restart DrScheme. (I used "^begin", "^def", and "^with".)

Open the Preferences frame, select the Editing tab, and then select the Indentation tab. The regexp fields are blank. Close the preferences frame.

Open the Preferences frame again. The text fields are filled in correctly.
>Fix:
The gui wasn't initialized properly.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation (also not a type error).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 25 May 2007 22:49:26 -0400
Reason>>> Thanks for the report. fixed in SVn.

(note that ^begin and ^def were already defaults, but you
just didn't see them!)
