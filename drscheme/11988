 Hi,
 
 so as you can see I tried to use the Bug Reporter Form...
 
 Unfortunately when pasting into the summary field, more than one line is
 accepted as input, without visual indication depending on which line
 happens to be visible. At least this is what I think happened.
 Unfortunately this borked the summary of this bug report which should
 instead have read:
 unable to middle-click paste in Bug Report Form fields
 Excess material seems to have been reported under the `Unformatted:' field.
 
 Marijn
