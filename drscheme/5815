>Description:
i just upgraded to 202.2 and noticed a problem with the 
prefs one more time. 

a week ago i had installed matthew's teachpack, played with
it, and then moved it to a permanent location. 

i also did a clear all teachpacks in drscheme. it crashed 
and all re-starts over the past week kept asking me about
the lack of this teachpack. at the same time, every restart
also keeps asking me whether i'm really interested in 
english as my natural language and whether i wouldn't 
consider beginner as my first Scheme language. 

something's wrong, and I am sorry if i don't provide a
better error report.

 The preferences file is saved on exit of any framework-using
 application. So, there are many things that can go wrong:
 
   - you start sirmail, you start drscheme, you configure drscheme,
     you exit drscheme, you exit sirmail.
 
 In that case, sirmail doesn't pick up the changed preferences and
 writes the original preferences to the file.
 
   - you start drscheme, you configure drscheme, it crashes.
 
 in that case, you never got your preferences saved.
 
 So, do you think that one of those two things happened, or is this a
 new problem?
