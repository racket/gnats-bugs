>Description:
When I comment out a box and place my cursor after its succeeding charecter, it deletes the box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type into the defintions window a short 2 charecter sequence.
Comment out the first charecter with a box.
Place your cursor at the end of the line (just after the second charecter)
Chose Scheme->Uncomment from the menu, the box gets deleted.
