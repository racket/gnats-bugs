MS Windows 95
>Description:
When I start up DrScheme, I am placed in the Interactions window
with the cursor at the first prompt, which is location 3:3.  However,
the display at the bottom reads

  0000:000-0000:000 

At the first re-draw, this corrects itself.  (Well, so I thought as I copied-
and-pasted that into this report.  But when I went back, I found that
the location hadn't corrected itself.  When I unselected and went back
to the DrScheme window, it had fixed itself.)

Also, when I select File|Exit I get a "are you sure" warning.  In this
window, the Exit button is highlighted.  However, hitting Return is
not enough -- you have to click the mouse on the button.  It's not clear
that this is even consistent with the Windows interface.

Also -- I know this doesn't belong here, but it's too minor -- the Why
DrScheme? section of the manual (a nice addition, methinks) has the
name of the conference slightly wrong, and doesn't link directly to the
paper in the publications page.

Finally, the help browser has no shortcuts for Back, Forward, etc.  I
think Alt-B for Back is far more useful than Alt-B for Bookmarks.

 More on the Exit+return issue.  The first time I get that window,
 return has no effect.  If I tab over to Cancel and tab back over to
 Exit, the visual appearance is the same, but now return indeed makes
 the application to exit.

 Alt-backarrow is the windows shortcut.

 I believe you wanted "space". Don't ask me why.
