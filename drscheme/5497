>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
On relatively slow systems (300mhz G3 Macintosh/ OS X 10.1.5), in DrScheme for OS X/Quartz windows show up like that: The dialog opens, all controls are visible and the cursor is blinking.

But it takes up to 5 seconds until the window responds to any kind of user input. Related to that, in a standard IDE edit window the edit field first has focus (during the 'sleep time' described), so you can type but will only see what you've typed 5 seconds later. But after the 'sleep time' is finished, it looses focus (you need to click on it again). 

Instead, the edit field should have focus all the time, but only allow user interaction when it is ready to give immediate visual feedback. If possible, extensive initializations should be done in advance before the window is actually shown.

 The focus problem, at least, is definitely fixed in more recent
 versions of MrEd.
 
 There have been so many other improvements since 200alpha21 that I'm
 not sure about the rest, but I recommend updating to the latest
 CVS-based version.
 
 In principle, I should be sending update messages to plt-scheme... but
 that would be just a cron job, because I commit significant
 improvements every few hours.
 
 Any feedback you can provide over the next few days is especially
 helpful, because we're planning to provide a Mac OS X bundle in next
 week's v200 release.
 
 Thanks for the feedback,
 Matthew

 Hi Erich,
 
   I don't know if Matthew Flatt has mentioned this to you or not, but
 many of the problems that you are mentioning have been fixed since
 alpha21 was released. In fact, Matthew is releasing daily improvments
 to the Quartz binaries! (this particular bug was one I found quite
 annoying, too -- it has been fixed).
 
 So, let me encourange you to get the latest version of the source code
 from the CVS archive by following the instructions at:
 
   http://www.plt-scheme.org/anoncvs/
 
 before submitting any more bug reports.
 
 Thanks very much for your help and support!
 
 Best,
 Robby
