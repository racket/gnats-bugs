 Are you switching back and forth between version 5.1 (or close to 5.1)
 and 5.0.2? If so, that would explain this. In particular, the two
 versions use the same lockfile under windows but use it differently.
 Long story short: they used it wrong in 5.0.2 because there are
 certain invariants that all non-windows filesystems provide, but
 windows doesn't that made the locking we do incorrect. THis error,
 roughly speaking, means "you used the other version and I'm taking
 over the lockfile from it to use it in a different manner".
 
 No to be too dumbed down, but I forget exactly the details but they
 are in the dev list archive (mostly messages from Matthew).

 The error looks to me like the bug that the change in v5.1 is intended
 to fix, as opposed to a problem when switching between versions 5.0.2
 and 5.1.
 
 Mitch: definitely let us know if you see the problem after upgrading to
 v5.1.
