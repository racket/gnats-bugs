Human Language: English
>Description:
DrScheme v200alpha does not seem to recognize and specially indent
MODULE.  Since I expect most of our code will be inside this form, it
would be nice to indent it as a special form (ie, 2 spaces) rather
than like a function -- the same thing Matthew's "how to" doc does.

>How-To-Repeat:
Go into the REPL with language set to module.
Type 
 (module canvas mzscheme
and hit return.  The cursor goes below CANVAS.

 Please note, for what it's worth, that this id is really from Windows
 2000 Professional.  On the other hand, I am constantly reminded that
 W2k is "Built on NT Technology", so iz arright.

 It does -- you just have your indenting preferences as some old 
 version's default. Either add it in, in the control panel, delete 
 your .mred.prefs file, or carefully edit your .mred.prefs file.

    module indentation is special -- the preferences need
