>Description:
See steps below
>How-To-Repeat:
In a fresh frame, create two tabs
In one tab, run Check Syntax
If you edit the program in that tab, the status line
 goes away
(If you run Check Syntax in two tabs and then edit one,
  the status line sticks around until you edit the
  other --- that's good)
If you close the tab before you edit, however, then
 the status line sticks around in the frame forever
>Fix:
when a tab closes, the status line needed to be closed.
>Release-Note:
there is no contract violation here.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 09 Jun 2006 21:27:18 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN
