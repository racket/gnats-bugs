>Description:
The initial repl before hitting Run in a new window in Beginning Student custom (w/ world.ss teachpack) is active in the Beginning Student language, but does not include the teachpack.  The repl should be inactive, or should include the teachpack.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load up the Beginning Student language.  Add the world.ss teachpack.  Run it.  Open a new window.  Try to run (empty-scene 200 200) in the new repl.
