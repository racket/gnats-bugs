>Description:
The module browser shows edges between module nodes, but
the direction of the dependencies isn't clear.  The point 
of modules (as against units) is that they can be topographically sorted, which isn't evident from what's shown.

There's probably no room for arrowheads, but maybe just 
a pixel or two of a different color could be used to indicate the directionality.  

The initial left-to-right layout appears to indicate directionality, I think, but users can move nodes around 
so the layout gives no information.
