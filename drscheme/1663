>Description:
I sent in a bug report about a week ago about Dr. Scheme pasting when you don't want it too. I thought it did it randomly, but I've figured out exactly what's happening. When I press the wheel on my Inteli Explorer mouse, it pastes whatever is on the clipboard into the Dr. Scheme definitions window at the point where the mouse is. Not Critical, but definitely annoying when you keep hitting it many times.

 Steck has one of those mice, I believe.

 This is, of course, a feature to those of us who are used to X bindings
 (i.e., middle button pastes).
 
 Should we change something?

 I had no idea! Pushing the wheel means button2? If so, we should 
 probably only map button2 to paste under X.
 
 What does pushing the wheel do under microsoft word and thing like that?

 I propose that I just remove this keybinding, under windows. Anyone
 against? I checked on Donna's computer and neither word nor ie do
 anything when you click the ball.

 Okay -- I changed it. Did anyone respond to the original poster 
 explaining the problem (and possibly how to fix it)?

 Hi. I am just writing to let you know that, for the next version, drscheme
 will not paste when you click that ball. 
 
 If you are interested, I can send you intestructions on how to change your
 version of drscheme so that clicking that little ball doesn't do anything.

 Okay. Here's what you do. Open up the file:
 
    plt/collects/framework/keymap.ss
 
 in your drscheme distribution. On line 978, you should see this:
 
    (map "middlebutton" "paste-click-region")
 
 just stick a semicolon at the front of that line:
 
    ; (map "middlebutton" "paste-click-region")
 
 Then, run "setup plt" with the "-c" commandline flag. Do this by 
 starting up a command prompt, using "cd" to get to the directory 
 where your PLT installation is and then typing this in:
 
    "setup plt" -c
 
 Hope that helps!
 
 Robby
