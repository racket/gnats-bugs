>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
The scrollbar of the edit field dissapears after you've hidden the definitions and showed them again. Refreshing the window doesn't seem to get back the scrollbars, so it might be more than a simple OS X display bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open an existing DrScheme document that does not fit on the screen (such that the scrollbar is shown when it first displayed).
2. Menu: Show -- Hide Definitions 
3. Menu: Show -- Show Definitions
