>Description:
DrRacket switches between tabs unbearably slow, and it's worse the more tabs I have. It takes ~5 seconds to switch between them with two tabs, and ~7 seconds with four tabs and ~10 seconds with six tabs.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrRacket
2. File -> Open Recent -> mod_graph-color.rkt
3. File -> Open Recent -> test_graph-color.rkt
4. Try to switch to the other tab that you have open by clicking on it
5. Wait... and wait... and wait...

Note that all of the files I'm using are on my local network on a Samba share, but I don't think network latency could explain the issue - I can open up 15 of the same files in Notepad++ and switching between tabs is instant.

 I'm about to push a fix for this bug that I've somewhat optimistically
 labelled as closing this PR.
 
 Alex: if you have the time and the interest to give it a try, that
 would be much appreciated, but if not, don't worry about it. To try
 it, I expect the easiest thing is to wait until this web page:
 
   http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 says that the build has been created on some day that is tomorrow or
 later and then download and install that version.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
