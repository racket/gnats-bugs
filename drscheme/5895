>Description:
(as in summary)
>How-To-Repeat:
open preferences window, click upper left most close window button,
see dialog displaying "are you sure you want to quit?"

>Fix:
the problem: the preferences window was being removed from the group list when the frame was closed, but when it was made visible again, it didn't get added back to the group list.

the fix: override the `show' method and add the frame back to the group. this also requires adding a check to the group's adding method, since the same frame can now be added multiple times.
>Release-Note:
contract: here's a contract that was violated: all visible frames must be in the frame group. It's easy to state, but I'm not sure where the enforcement would go.

 The problem appears to be a little more subtle, the first it's tried after
 starting DrScheme this doesn't occur, but will on the second and subsequent
 attempts to open then subsequently close the preferences window via the
 close window button.

 Is overriding the `show' method enough to catch all calls to show #T
 and show #t or is there another method I should use?
 
 Thanks,

 The bug: the preferences window is closed, via:
 
   (when (send f can-close?)
     (send f on-close)
     (send f show #f))
 
 but the window is still held onto (ie, not gc'd).
 
 Then, it is (send f show #t)'d. I'm not sure of the best way to deal
 with this, but I've hacked together something now (when ever show #t is
 called, the frame is added to the group list, unless it was already
 there).
