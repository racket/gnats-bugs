When the bug was submitted and the dialog box says so,
clicking the done button still offers to save it.

(I'm not sure about that, so this bug report is going to
be its own test case, which makes me very happy.)

 Must be some race condition, since this reflective test didn't show
 the problem.  I think that in the previous bug I might have hit space very
 quickly once the text showed -- I'm almost sure that I've seen the
 confirmation test appear, so maybe I hit it while it was rendering
 it.  I'll try it more from home, when I disable the actual emails...
