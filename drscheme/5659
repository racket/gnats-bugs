 That's kind of violent -- I wouldn't expect software to work under those

 If you do the mv before running install, everything should work.  That's
 what we do for the released versions in /proj/scheme/.

 I'm not sure that that will work for macos x, but it's okay since we
 number the directories with the version numbers now.
