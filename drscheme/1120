>Description:
The Edit/Preferences panel's font changer (in particular, the size slider,
I haven't actually tried the more general font change) takes effect for
the current DrScheme session even if you click the Cancel button rather
than OK.  The difference between cancel and OK is only apparent if you
quit DrScheme and restart.
>How-To-Repeat:
Edit/Preferences, slide slider, click cancel -- note fonts are different
size.
