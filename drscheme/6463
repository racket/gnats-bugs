 Thanks for the bug report!
 
 FWIW, We're planning a totally new integration of the test suites into
 DrScheme for the next release (it won't be a separate window anymore).

Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 05:00:03 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:56:24 -0500
Reason>>> drscheme (probably already solved)
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 03 Apr 2004 19:15:27 -0500
Reason>>> v206 has a new test case mechanism that doesn't have this problem.

Thanks for the report!
