Why is ctrl+y not REDO in dr scheme?

Every other program on the planet has ctrl + y as redo..

I just accidently pasted shit all over my code, and now I can't even undo and redo it.

Press ctrl + y

 C-y is redo in DrScheme, where it is a convention to do so.

 Uh, no, that's wrong in general, and more wrong on Linux where there
 are no standards than on other platforms.  If you're looking for more
 complete uniformity, then you're using the wrong OS.
 
 It's true that C-y has become common enough to justify a feature
 request -- and saying just that would have made your bug report less
 likely to be ignored.
 
 Also, IME, C-S-Z started to become a common alternative for a redo
 key.

 1. Undo should also work in undoing any shit that you might have
    pasted.
 
 2. If the pasted shit was not desired, then why would you want to redo
    it?
 
 3. If you do want to redo, then have a look in the edit menu -- it
    says that Ctrl+Shift+Z is the key for redo.

 Also to note: redoing shit used to be the damn control-y shit key, but
 it shit shit shit shit was changed for contsistency with other shit
 apps. Yes, on this planet. Shit.

 Just to note:
 I am sorry for my use of the word 'shit' in a bug report....
 I did not really mean anything "offensive" by it, so I am sorry if that
 offended you.
 
 It is a word in the english language.
 
 
 And I still think that ctrl+y on LINUX should be redo....
 Sorry if other people disagree

 Thanks for the apology. I hope you weren't too annoyed by response
 poking fun at you.
 
 You might want to look into the user keybindings section of the manual
 to be able to set that keybinding up yourself. It shouldn't be too
 hard. (Let me know if you get stuck.)
