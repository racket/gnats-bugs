 Yes, sorry. The docs are out of date. evaluate-from-port is what you
 (probably want).
 
 I'll try to get them updated soon.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

State changed from "open" to "closed" by dyoo at Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:36:10 -0500
Reason>>> This appears corrected.  There are no references to do-many-evals or do-
many-text-evals in the current scribble documentation, and evaluate-from-
port has documentation.
