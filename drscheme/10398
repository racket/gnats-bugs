>Description:
After lauch DrScheme,I could only input an ascii character wherever in file editor area or in read-eval-print area, even in an input field of bug report dialog. I guess the problem may be caused by locale setting, because my locale settings are "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.UTF-8" when the problem occurred, but after I set LC_CTYPE to en_US.UTF-8, the problem vanished.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. set LANG to en_US.UTF-8
2. set LC_CTYPE to zh_CN.UTF-8
3. run DrScheme
>Fix:
