>Description:
redex.racket-lang.org
In first paragraph:
  "allows you to interactive[ly] explore"

5.2.1/DrRacket/3.3.8 "Defining Custom Shortcuts"
  Spurious blank line in `frame-key' definition.

5.2.1/Reference/5.4.1 "Methods"

  Did double-take on "Method names within a class can only be",
   as referring to method names that come from a class.
   Consider "Method names used within a class can only be".

  `send*' should have `+' on `msg ...'
  And error message refers to implementation:
    > (send* #f)
    let*: bad syntax in: (let* ((o #f)))
