>Description:
Since the buttons on the lower right corner of the bug report dialog now
have a "Close and Save" button, the difference in order due to OS conventions
becomes very confusing.  On Linux I have C&S,Cancel,Submit and on Windows it's
C&S,Submit,Cancel.  I'd prefer if it had the same order regardless of platform
conventions -- but if that's unacceptable, then at least move the C&S button
to a place it won't be confusing?

 I've moved it over to the left-hand side of the button bar, but I
 think this isn't really an improvement. Most people stick with one OS
 so won't be confused like you were, I expect.
 
 If you had something else in mind, let me know.
