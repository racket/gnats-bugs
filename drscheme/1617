>Description:
the standard s-expression highlight normally shown when the cursor
is immediately to the right of an sexp is not shown when that 
line contains a semicolon in a string. However, the sexp editor
bindings (back sexp, forward sexp, etc.) still work fine, so it's
not the paren-matcher that's broken.

(curiously, I've discovered while submitting this bug report
that the text-boxes in the bug report form do not recognize
semicolons as comment characters and thus do not suffer from
this problem)
