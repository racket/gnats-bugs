>Description:
Check-syntax erroneously issues an error message when asked to
check files in which a module is declared and then later required.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following code into drscheme's definitions window:

(module a mzscheme
  (provide b)
  (define b 1))

(require a)

Run check-syntax. It produces the error message "require: unknown
module in: a"

If you click execute, the code evaluates correctly (no error, and
the identifier b is bound to value 1).

 FWIW, this is one in a series of bugs that we plan to address in the
 future with some better support for the top-level.
 
 Right now, since the way execute "knows" that the module is defined is
 by a side-effect that happens during evaluation, check syntax (since it
 doesn't do any evaluation) can't figure that out.
 
 Use separate files to work around the bug for now. In file "a.ss"
 
   (module a mzscheme (provide b) (define b 1))
 
 In another file:
 
   (require "a.ss")
 
 Hope that helps,
 Robby

    works now. even this works:
    
    
    (module a mzscheme
      (provide b)
      (define b 1)) 
    
    (module b mzscheme
      (require a)
      b)
