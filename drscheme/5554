>Description:
If you hit the break button just after startup, type an 
expression, then hit Enter, DrScheme goes into a loop.  
You can break out of the loop, but it's unexpected behavior.

Hitting break later doesn't seem to cause the problem.


>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Hit the Break button
Enter 42
Hit return
>Fix:

>Release-Note:
I'm not sure precisely what contract could have caught this one,
but there is clearly some contract. There was an invariant
that was broken: the repl should only have allowed
breaking when there was something to break (ie,
a user evaluation). The state was initialized wrong.
