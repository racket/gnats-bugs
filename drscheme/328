>Description:
If an invalid library unit is selected, DrScheme will not execute anything
as it shouldn't.  However, after quitting DrScheme, it won't start up
again properly.  Instead it gives the same error messages it gives when
trying to execute something with the invalid library selected.  Then
MrEdJr pops up instead of DrScheme.  It would be better for DrScheme to
select no library if the given one isn't working properly.

This problem appears on australia and on my power Mac at home.  I've tried
both drscheme and drscheme -x on australia.

Removing the library line from the preferences file allows DrScheme to
start up again.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load the library t.ss which contains
(unit/sig (x)
  (import)
  (define x 5))
Type 5 in the definitions window.
Click Execute.
Clear the error message.
Quit DrScheme
Restart DrScheme
