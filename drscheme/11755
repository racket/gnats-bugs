 What platform?
 
 For example, under windows control-l is a menu shortcut that opens the
 language dialog. Under mac os x, control-l centers the insertion point
 vertically (ala Emacs). Also, I just tried both and they both seem to
 work so I think we need more information to figure out what happened.
 (I'm using a slightly newer version than 5.1, tho.) One thing to try:
 does this happen in a freshly opened DrRacket?
 
 Also, In the future, please use DrRacket to submit bug reports instead
 of the web form.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 In fact I had used several times ctrl-L with no problems before, then
 one time happened the freeze.
 I had to shut down drracket through the task manager. I tried
 successively in another session and the freeze happened again.
 
 Now I tried several times and the choose language dialog opens regularly.
 
 I can't reconstruct what I did differently the other times.
 
 AHA!  I just did one last try before sending this email and it froze again.
 
 I had just done a "check syntax" then hit "run", the cursor was in the
 interaction window.
 The drracket window is irresponsive to anything. The drracket process
 is sucking 50% CPU (on a dual core).
 
 Let me try again in a new drracket...  nope. Doing the same now doesn't freeze.
 
 I'll let you know if I succeed in finding a reproducible sequence of
 actions which causes the freeze.

 Alas, I cannot. I am at work, behind a firewall which allows external
 connections only through Internet explorer 8^(

 Thank you. I don't think that we have any regular users of XP on the
 core development team so maybe someone switching over for a little
 while would help.
 
 The big changes in 5.1 suggest that this may be a problem with
 sequences of callbacks that confuse the gui, and it could even depend
 on how busy drracket is or how fast (or slow) you click. (Not very
 helpful, I know...)

 FWIW, I have a not-so-fast windows laptop running xp, so I tried to
 reproduce this in several ways that involve syntax check, but it
 always worked fine (even when during the check syntax).

 I observed that sometimes when I'm getting this error, other programs
 acts strangely too. For example I.E. cannot open new tabs.
 
 Could it be that there's a windows resource that gets low when
 there are many graphical objects active, and drracket is not checking
 correctly a return value from an OS call?
 
 Cheers.

 I have windows XP on my laptop and I played around for a bit but could
 not reproduce the problem. I even set my cpu load to 100% (two cores),
 but I could not get drracket to hang. Is there a specific file you are
 using when drracket freezes? Also, how long did you wait before
 force-closing drracket? Could it be that the responsiveness of your
 overall system was just slow?

 We do our best to check all such things of course! This may be a
 useful clue tho. Thanks.

 It happened while working on the two different files I'm working currently
 (two unrelated projects).
 
 Yesterday happened once more, after pressing the Macro Stepper
 button.  My feeling, now, is that is the attempt to open a new window
 in a strained resource condition, that causes the problem.

 No, I waited long enough to exclude this possibility.
 
 (and thanks to all the developers for the whole system and for your
 responsiveness!)
