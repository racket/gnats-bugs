>Description:
try check syntax on this: 

(define-macro inf
  (lambda ()
    (let [(body '(lambda () #f))]
      (set-cdr! (cdr body) body)
      body)))
(inf)

it goes into an infinite loop.

Responsible-Changed-When: Wed Nov 28 20:17:03 2001
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    this is something that expand doesn't handle, actually.
    here is the updated v200 example that runs forever:
    
    (define-syntax (inf stx)
      (datum->syntax-object
       (syntax 1)
       (let [(body '(lambda () #f))]
         (set-car! (cddr body) body)
         body)))
    
    (expand '(inf))
State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 10 16:52:46 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    Check Syntax just needs a break button. If there was
    a problem with MzScheme where expansion didn't break
    (and maybe there was - I forget), it's been fixed.
