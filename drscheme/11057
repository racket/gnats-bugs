>Description:
It's great that C-x 2 and C-x 0 work, but C-x 0 closes the wrong window ("pane?").

In Emacs, C-x 0 means "I'm done with this one".  In contrast, in DrRacket, C-x 0 seems to mean "Close the OTHER one".  That means the usual Emacs pattern of "C-x 2 ... go on an excursion ... done and ready to return to where we were before ... C-x 0" fails devastatingly in DrRacket (you're now left at the end of your excursion, which is totally the wrong place).

This manifests itself as an ill-definition, too: if you have three windows/panes open, in Emacs, C-x 0 unambiguously means "close the one I'm in".  In DrRacket, it closes a different one than the one I'm in, which can be surprising when there is more than one different one (ie, there is no unique "other").

I strongly encourage aligning DrRacket's C-x 0 with that of Emacs, since it addresses a common use-case in Emacs-land, has a cleaner semantics, and resolves the weaker definition in DrRacket than in Emacs.

Thanks!
