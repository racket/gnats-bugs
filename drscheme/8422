>Description:
When I edit a DrScheme file that is not saved, I see a #mredauto#1#
file appearing in my home directory.  I think that it's questionable
whether people want autosave files for buffers that were not associated with a file yet (I tend to create lots of little throwaway tabs with
snippets in class) -- but if it does, then the autosave should go in
~/.plt-scheme/, not where DrScheme starts (I guess it appeared in my
home dir since that's where I started it).

 I've resisted changing this, since I dont' want those autosave files to
 get lost.

 So maybe the bug should be considered a mred bug -- I said that it's
 questionable whether you want them or not (and I vote for no: if you
 didn't save it, you deserve what you get...) but what I *definitely*
 don't want is to have files popping up in my home directory, when
 there's a perfectly reasonable place to put them.  That's even more
 true when you consider people who use DrScheme and have no clue what
 the file is until they look inside.
 
 (A temp file is even better than ~/.plt-scheme for these things.)
 
 And yes, if they're saved elsewhere, then there's a question of
 actually finding them -- but if you *want* them to stay in, then they
 should not be called "#mred#1#" on unix since that's hard to deal
 with.  (So in that case, I'd at least vote for changing the name, and
 adding an option, hopefully with a false deault value.)

 I think an optimal solution would involve drscheme knowing about the  
 files and asking to open them back up again when it is restarted  
 (note that this code is in the framework, so there would have to be  
 some way to record whose files they were -- sirmail will create them,  
 as well as drscheme and you don't want the wrong one opening them up).
 
 Anyways, that's another thing that's going to get pushed low on my  
 priority list.
 
 Speaking of which -- how's the lazy stepper coming?  ;)

 Well -- email is different.  Even in Emacs, you almost never get
 autosave files for unassociated buffers, but almost all mailers *will*
 save replies (which are unassociated buffers) somewhere.

 How about just moving it to /tmp for now?  That shouldn't be hard, no?

 Believe it or not, I had this problem while playing with it.  (The
 version that is in my class plugin, not the one in the plt tree.)

 No -- I don't want the files to get lost. I'm worried about students
 who don't save until just before they turn the thing in. (they exist! I
 had one this quarter ...)

 So my other side applies:
 
 How about just calling them "drscheme-autosave-N" instead?  Calling it
 "#mred..." is almost as good as lost on some interfaces.

 You're welcome to fix it, when the stepper is done. I'll fix it when I
 have time.
