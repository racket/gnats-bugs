>Description:
I got this bug when starting DrScheme from the latest SVN sources (it only came up the first time, not subsequently, but that one time it completely halted DrScheme):

current-eventspace: expects argument of type <eventspace>; given #f

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The bug seems to have been that nothing was holding onto the user's eventspace (except via a weak-box) for a short time and, if a gc happened during that time, the eventspace was lost. To fix it, I just hold onto the eventspace during that time.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. It would not have been a type error.

 This happened to me once too, but I couldn't figure out what made it
 happen or how to bring it back or anything like that. If you do notice
 something, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
