>Description:
www.drscheme.org says "DrScheme is useful given at least 32 MB of RAM."
I think expectations for 204 would be set better by recommending a
number than results in at least 48 MB of RAM be available for DrScheme
alone, on top of the memory requirements of the rest of the system.

I've found that the 48 MB RAM on my X86 GNU/Linux laptop isn't adequate
for running DrScheme on any but the smallest programs, even though I've
minimized the memory requirements of the kernel, system services, and X.
At startup of DrScheme, just after selecting English and the MzScheme
language, the "mred" process is using 43 MB of VM.  Hitting the GC button
a few times, then loading a file like "sxml-tools.ss" in the editor and
hitting the Check Syntax button results in close to 10 minutes of lockup.
This seems to be due to swap thrashing.

Perhaps recommend 128 MB RAM, but note that DrScheme can run with less?
