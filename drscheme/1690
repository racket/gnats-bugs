>Description:
I downloaded a mysterx.plt file
I dropped it on DrScheme and started the install process 
It turns out that the file is apparently truncated. 
This triggers two errors: 
  1. char->integer given eof 
     that's during unpacking apparently
  2. fprintf error: wrong format for printing an error 

PaulS has a copy of the truncated file. He cannot reproduce 
it on his VAIO. 

Sorry that's all I have
