 You can change this with the `compile-enforce-module-constants', but
 you might just want to provide a `trace-fact' function.

 Hi Richard -- you want to add the line (trace fact) to the Definitions window (say bottom) and then you can use it just like in Chez:

 NOTE: the example in the reference manual needs an annotation that it is for plain racket not drracket.

 Wasn't there supposed to be a language option that toggles
 `compile-enforce-module-constants'?

 For drracket, that's the wrong thing.

 Another question -- Enable Tracing is supposed to be on the Choose Language/Details panel.  Doesn't seem to be there.
