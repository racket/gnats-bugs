>Description:
Enter the code below in a fresh tab, click run, and hit the stacktrace
button without saving it.  When I do this I get:

open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/home/eli/unsaved-editor1149" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(car 'blah)
>Fix:
The interpretation of the source location field was wrong (it matched an old version of how things worked). 
>Release-Note:
This was a contract error. I think it couldn't have been a type error, since in both the wrong and the correct code, symbols are the type. In principle, the symbols in the correct code could have been an abstract type, but they have to be marshallable to be saved in a compiled file, so they couldn't really have been (if that makes any sense).
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 10 Aug 2009 21:05:45 -0400
Reason>>> fixed in SVN.

THanks for the report!
