>Description:
In case-expression clauses having multiple datum's, only the first datum is colored as a literal;  all the others are colored as base syntax.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter code like

    (lambda (x)
      (case
          x
        ((a b c) 1)
        (else 2)))
in the definitions window and check-syntax.  "a" will be colored as a literal, while "b" and "c" will be colored as base syntax.
