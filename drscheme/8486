>Description:
I'm still seeing the behavior I described in bug 8138, although only w.r.t. certain keybindings.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following two module definitions in different tabs in the same DrScheme window:

(module a mzscheme
  
  (require "b.ss")
  
  (b))

(module b mzscheme
  
  (provide b)
  
  (define b
    (lambda ()
      (#f))))

Save as a.ss and b.ss in the same directory.

Select the a.ss tab.  Hit Run.  Click on the dog-eared page icon in the resulting error message; DrScheme will highlight the application (#f) in b.ss.

Change this application to (printf "42~n"), and save.

Switch back to the a.ss tab.  Hit the 'f' key; nothing happens.  Hit F5 (i.e., Run).  Nothing happens.  Cmd-T, however, *does* re-execute the file.

 I'm not seeing the behavior you report in the PR.
 
 In fact, I always get the focus in the definitions text (and
 everything works properly) after the switch back -- even when it
 should have been in the interactions window ... I'm not sure why that
 is, tho.

 I just started a fresh DrScheme and reproduced the behavior that you
 described above.  I don't have time to investigate right now, but I'm
 starting to wonder if this isn't a stateful problem: after a lot of user
 interactions and executions, DrScheme gets into a state where it doesn't
 restore the focus correctly in these situations.  That was certainly the
 case in which I noticed it yesterday.

 Okay. If you do happen to discover what triggers it, that would be a help.
