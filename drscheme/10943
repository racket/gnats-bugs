On XP, DrRacket v5.0.0.1,

with:
#lang scribble/manual

when clicking on the Scribble HTML button, this attempts to use "open", but fails with the error:

 [Output to E:\Projets\Scheme-svn\towers\docs\manual.html]
'open' n'est pas reconnu en tant que commande interne
ou externe, un programme exécutable ou un fichier de commandes.

(this is probably the shell speaking)

However, the html file is generated (but not opened)

 If the above says that "open" is not a recognized command, then it
 looks like sendurl might be trying to use `open' as in OSX.  Can you
 check if the sendurl library is working=3F

 Can you try a more recent version? I think I fixed this sometime after
 May 20.
 
 The bug wasn't in `sendurl'. The "HTML" button was using "open" for
 HTML on all platforms (though code that was intended for use with PDF).

 I suppose this is not the same as the 5.0.0.1 I have ?

 FWIW: No -- and DrRacket shows some extra information that indicates
 the date it was built from, and the relevant commit.
 
 (Maybe racket should show it too?)
