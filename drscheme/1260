 The code in ~scheme/plt/collects/drscheme does not have this string;
 did the release somehow get that string in it?
 
 Strange.

 Tabbing works under windows (except from the two big tecxt fields,
 where it indents scheme code...)
 
 Is that true of unix, too?
 
 [I would ask someone else, but you are the only developer using unix
 these days...]

 Yes. Tabbing works the same on all platforms. I assumed that the PR was
 about the mutli-line text fields.
 
 BTW, I find the Scheme mode in the two big fields annoying. I think
 others have complained, too (or maybe just Shriram). Scheme mode sounds
 like a nice idea, since a user is somewhat likely to place code there.
 But the mode seems to get in the way more often than it helps,
 especially since Scheme code is usually pasted from somewhere else.

 Ah. I just mistakenly focused in on the capitol P. Thanks for pointing
 that out. I have fixed and committed this (but not tagged or released it).

 Yeah, I have been thinking the same thing. I will get rid of it.

 Thanks for the bug report. I have fixed the typo for 102. As far as
 the tabbing goes, the two larger text boxes are in Scheme mode (just
 like the interactions and definitions windows in drscheme proper) so
 tab means "indent line". This was a bad idea. In 102, they will just
 be regular text boxes and tab will work as expected.
