>Description:
when a simple error (e.g., providing wrong number of arguments to
a function) is encountered, execution stops, the appropriate error message
is reported, and the offending code is highlighted...

however, at that point, a couple of windows pop up (one of which is
standard output) saying that i should check the "get-admin" function
in one of the files i have loaded.  that function is nothing i have defined by the way...

i hit OK and close those windows ... but then dr. scheme's definitions
and interactions windows are frozen (more or less)... i can scroll them
but i can't enter anything into them...

my only recourse has been to close the window (if possible) or 
hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and kill dr. scheme altogether.

i haven't been able to reproduce this error using simple code existing
within a single file; but any error seems to cause this problem.

i have used "define-syntax" to define some macros ...
does that have something to do with it?

any help would be much appreciated...

i use dr. scheme for a class ... we use Macs in our lab...
but i have a windows machine at home that i want to use to develop
the code and i need it to work on both platforms... many students
do the same thing...

luke hunsberger

p.s. i will try to whittle away at my files so that i can reproduce
the error with a minimum of code... but that may take some time...

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The fix is to filter out source locations that aren't
editors for the red error arrows in 
plt/collects/drscheme/private/debug.ss
>Release-Note:
This is a contract violation, but probably only would have
been triggered in the situations that manifest the bug already.

 Can you send in the exact text of the error message that appears? I
 believe it should appear in a box labelled "internal error".
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 hi robby,
 
   the actual text of the error message is as follows:
 
 send: target is not an object: |C:\Documents and Settings\luke hunsberger\Desktop\cs365\asst-2-search\gen-search.scm| for method: get-admin
 
   it appears in a window labeled "DrScheme Internal Error".  It also
 appears in a "Standard Output" window.
 
   there are multiple files that are loaded in a chain.  i evaluate an
   expression E1 in "vac-world.scm" that in turn evaluates an
   expression E2 in "gen-search.scm" that in turn evaluates a different
   expression E3 in "vac-world.scm" <-- whenever I introduce any kind
   of silly error into E3, the definitions and interactions windows
   become unresponsive in the "vac-world.scm" frame; any other frames
   (e.g., "gen-search.scm") that happen to be open are fine.  the 
   error in expression E3 in "vac-world.scm" is properly highlighted.
   it seems that Dr. Scheme is trying to point to the source of the
   error in "gen-search.scm" and is encountering some problem with
   its "gen-admin" function.  
 
   by the way, I am using the language "Graphical (Mr Ed includes MzScheme)"
   
 thanks for looking into this.
 
 i am not currently able to test any of this on macs (am out of town).

State-Changed-When: Thu Jun 19 11:57:09 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    
    fixed and released to CVS
    
    to get the fix, you need to either wait for v205, or start
    using the CVS version of DrScheme. Details at:
    
      http://www.plt-scheme.org/anoncvs/
    
    These are the conditions that trigger the bug:
    
      - an error is raised in a debugging language level 
        (but not teaching langs)
      - the source location of the error is in the definitions window
      - the stack trace contains frames that are not in the definitoins
        window (and thus have source locations in some other file)
    
    
    (note: if the source location for the error is also in the other file, the bug doesn't happen).
    
    
    Once the bug happens, you do not need to restart DrScheme or force
    quit or anything. Just close the window where the error happened
    and open another window. The bug only disables the one window.
