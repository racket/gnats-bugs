>Description:
"Jump to Definition" (context menu command enabled by Check Syntax) doesn't necessarily jump to the name's definition site, but rather to the module the name was imported from (which may re-provide it from another source).

It seems like "Jump to Definition" should jump to the actual definition site (source-mod instead of nominal-source-mod, in the terminology of the 'identifier-binding' docs).
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(apply + '(1 2 3))

Run Check Syntax. Right click on 'apply', select "Jump to Definition". DrScheme opens $PLT/collects/scheme/main.ss, which doesn't define 'apply', just re-provides it from scheme/base.
>Fix:
The bug was as described in the email transcript and the fix similar (altho there were a few other little things to fix on the way).
>Release-Note:
This probably would not have been a type error, since the various results of identifier-binding would have had the same type (since they are different instances of the same kinds of things).

This was not a contract error.

 Yes, I've noticed the same thing recently and was surprised that it
 didn't already do that. Anyone see any reason why it shouldn't?

 Maybe Check Syntax is currently using the third and fourth results of
 `identifier-binding' because those are the ones needed to connect
 identifiers to `require' forms. But it should use the first and second
 results for jumping to a definition.

 Thanks, that was it and I've committed a fix.
