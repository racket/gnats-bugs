>Description:
Whenever I open files in DrRacket the internal counter for new documents seems to be incremented.
Actually when opening a file (in a new tab) before the file is loaded it seems that a new empty file is created. Thus, after opening and closing some files, you end up getting "Untitled 34" for maybe you first new file.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Start DrRacket.
2) Open several files in new tabs.
3) Observe that before each file is open, a new tab appear showing "Untitled NN" (ever increasing NN).
4) Create a new tab/file (ctrl+T).
5) Observe that the file is called Untitled 13, instead of Untitled 1 or 2.
