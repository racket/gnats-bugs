>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
set the language level to include test coverage annotations
in the "show details" portion of the language dialog.

run this program and click the button

(define f (new frame% (label "frame")))
(define b (new button%
               (label "button")
               (parent f)
               (callback
                (lambda (x y)
                  (+ 1 2)))))
(send f show #t)

it should color the callback green, but it doesn't
(until you type something in the interactions window)
