>Description:
	Clicking the execute button while DrScheme is already
executing or evaling an REP expression gives a strange error message
about the thread being killed. In the case of clicking execute while
DrScheme executing, it seems that DrScheme's evaluator doesn't recover
(it gets into a strange state), but I can still exit.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Execute (let loop () (loop)), then click Execute again.
>Fix:
