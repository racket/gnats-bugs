Responsible-Changed-Why:

I fixed the bitmap to be a .bmp file, size 8x8, but mred does not recognize 
it as a b/w bitmap, even though it appears to be black and white and I
saved it as a black and white bitmap, using paint under windows. 

To reproduce:

  [Thu 09 Sep] ~> mred -f tmp.ss
  set-stipple in pen%: bitmap is not monochrome: #<object:bitmap%>

where tmp.ss has this:

(send (make-object pen%) set-stipple
      (make-object bitmap% (build-path (collection-path "icons") "paren.bmp")))
