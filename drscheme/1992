>Description:

the exit procedure in the beginning languages is documented as taking zero
arguments, but it really takes one.

Something needs to change if it really takes zero, no no zero argument apps 
are allowed.

I didn't do an exhaustive check, so someone might want to do that to be
sure that there aren't other primitives whose behavior in beginner doesn't
match mzscheme's built ins.
