The "Implementing DrScheme Tools" documentation says what six signatures
must be imported into a tool, and then gives an example that differs
from what was just said.  It turns out that neither the text nor the
example is right.

Thanks for the report. The documentation has been fixed. The correct
example is:

(unit/sig ()
  (import mred-interfaces^
          mzlib:core^
          framework^
          [print-convert : mzlib:print-convert^]
          [drscheme : drscheme:export^]
          [zodiac : zodiac:system^])

  (mred:message-box "tool loaded"))

The mred-interfaces^ signature has everything in the mred manual, plus
interfaces for all classes that didn't have them. It is described in the
framework manual. The zodiac:system^ signature is described in the tools
manual (and the docs are a little skimpy, right now).
