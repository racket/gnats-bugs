>Description:
According to the docs, split should not be in the teaching languages.

It is, however, an din a funny way. No matter how one tries to use
it, it is a keyword error.

presumably the other turtles keywords need to be checked and the 
other langage levels need to be checked.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; all of the following examples highlight the keyword,
;; none of them highlight any parenthesis.

Welcome to DrScheme, version 103.5d104.
Language: Beginning Student.
> split
keyword: invalid use of keyword split
> (split 1)
keyword: invalid use of keyword split
> (split 1 2)
keyword: invalid use of keyword split

we should remove `split' from the teaching languages and instead have a
"little language" for the turtles.
