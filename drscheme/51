>Description:
Suppose I am in directory A.  A has a sub-directory B.  In B are two
files, 1 and 2.  1's contents are (load-relative "2").  2 does a
printf.  From A, I do a (reference "B/1").

In MzScheme, this works fine.  In DrScheme, it doesn't, as Robby has
observed earlier.  However, it doesn't work in DrScheme if you use
load/use-compiled either, which means the problem likely isn't at the
level of M3.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow the layout above.
>Fix:
Matthew believes the problem is because the load-handler is being
overridden improperly in DrScheme.

 In fact, the bottom load-handler is not called in drscheme. However, I do
 set the load-relative directory for the load handler, and it works in
 Spidey. I don't see in the documentation anything that contradicts what I
 do -- I set the current-load-relative-directory to the directory where the
 file that is being loaded sits, and after the load completes, I set it back
 to whatever it was before. Is that right?

 That's right.
 
 Where can I find this code?

 ~/plt/drscheme/rep.ss. I'm trying to track down exactly what's going on
 now.

 Sorry -- it looks like I hadn't released that. I will release soon.
