>Description:
Under Mac OS X, when you open a file with DrRacket and DrRacket isn't already open, this should cause DrRacket to start up and then bring up a window editing that file.  Usually this is indeed what happens; but if you switch away from DrRacket while the splash screen is still up, then it merely loads a new untitled document instead of the file.

I've produced this behavior in this version, in v5.1.3.2, and in v5.1, while I've observed correct behavior in v5.0.1.
>How-To-Repeat:
0. On Mac OS X, ensure that DrRacket is not open.
1. Open a file with DrRacket.  This can be done by e.g. double-clicking a "file.rkt", or running "open -a DrRacket.app file.rkt", or drag-and-dropping a file onto the (not open) DrRacket icon in the dock.
2. Switch to a different application while the splash screen is up, so that DrRacket is not the active application when the splash screen finishes.
3. Wait for the splash screen to finish, and observe that the file doesn't get opened.
