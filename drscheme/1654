>Environment:
MS Windows 98
>Description:
When Dr. Scheme is open, and I try to paste something from the clipboard, whether pasting in Dr. Scheme or in some other program, like Internet Explorer, random placements of what's on the clipboard appear in my Scheme code. I found it many places, so I knew it wasn't just a user error
>How-To-Repeat:
I copied an web address from an e-mail, then pasted it in the Address bar of Internet Explorer 5.5. I found that web address in many places in my Scheme code.

I also copied one part of my definitions code, and pasted it somewhere else in the code, and it appeared in more than one place.
