>Description:
After an error in check syntax, you can't use the mouse to select
text in the definitions window until you press a key.  You can still
use the keyboard to select text.  This also appears in 
DrScheme 103.5d105.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; paste into definitions window

(cond 6)

;; hit check syntax
;; dismiss warning window that pops up
;; use the mouse to try to select text

;; as an aside: having a window pop up is annoying
;; how about a status bar?
