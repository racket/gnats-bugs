>Description:
When a program is running, the Step, Check Syntax, and Execute
buttons are all greyed out, so visually, I can easily tell that
the program is running.  However, when the program is *not* running,
the Break button is *not* greyed out.  As far as I can tell, the
Break button has no use unless the program is running, so I think
that it should be greyed out most of the time.

 The buttons being greyed out corresponds to the main thread running an
 interaction or an execution, not other threads, nor other GUI
 callbacks.
