>Description:
I was just playing with ghc (for reasons I won't go 
into).  It issues warning messages when one binding 
shadows another.  

I think it would be useful if Check Syntax colored 
shadowing bindings somehow.  Like in
  
  (lambda (x)
    (lambda (x) x))

maybe the inner x could have a special color.

I realize the Check Syntax arrows already provide 
this info, but unless you mouse over the bound 
variable, you might not be aware of a problem.
A different color would reveal the issue immediately.

 That's the same issue as proper alpha renaming, right?

 I'm not sure what you mean. Check syntax does proper alpha-renaming,
 right?

 No, it doesn't allow names that occur somewhere else. 
 I.e., it doesn't take a true alpha quotient.

 It's not that. It doesn't let you introduce a hole in the scope of a
 binding. In this program:
 
   ((let ([x 1]) x)
    (let ([y 1]) y))
 
 you can rename the `y' to an `x' just fine.
 
 I forget now, but it might be possible to do the real thing. I don't
 recall why I didn't do the real thing. Certainly I wont do anything
 until I find the time to build a test suite...
