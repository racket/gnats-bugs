 I haven't been able to reproduce your problem. I have used DrScheme with
 lowercase and uppercase on our windows machines here.
 
 A new release is coming out this week; perhaps that will solve your
 problems....
 
 Sorry I can't be of more help!

 I don't think we have hebrew mode around here any where, but you should 
 probably at least know about this.

 Thank you for trying.
 The problem was because i use an hebrew version windows. Instead of getting
 lowercase letters, the computer got hebrew letters, and that i think was
 the problem.
 Thanks again.

 Is it really a font problem, i.e., if he changes the font through the
 preferences, does it fix the problem?
