 The paren matcher is approximate (at best) and it is used to determine
 when a complete expression is available for input. Rather than fix the
 paren matcher (a long standing task no one seems to want...), I've
 added something to DrScheme so that when you type alt-return, DrScheme
 trusts your judgement and starts processing the input as a complete
 expression. The new code is available via our CVS server (see
 http://www.drscheme.org/ for details on using it) and we should see
 another release before the end of the summer.
 
 Hope that helps!
