>Description:
in my drscheme, case-lambda & case-lambda* are indented like other lambda
forms.  It appears to me that they should be indented like 'begin' (as
other (kwd clause ...) forms are).  If this is just my messed up prefs file,
please disregard this change request.

 I'm such an idiot.  I meant 'match-lambda,' not case-lambda.
 
 Make more sense now?

 Ah. Yes. (It hadn't even occurred to me that case-lambda* was something
 not in help desk :). that's fixed, now. Same caveat applies, however.
