Per Robby's request:

   5. So now I was curious. After all I had developed the core of the system
   inside of 52/* and switched to a MrEd script at the very end (when I
   added tcp connectivity). 

   Here is what I get on the Acer/linux box, which is the best I have at home: 

   - the MrEd language signals the same error message. 

   - when I broke the execution I got the following error message:
   BREAK-THREAD: EXPECTS ARGUMENT OF TYPE <THREAD>; GIVEN #F
   (both in a box and in a console)

   - in the R4RS+ language I get a bit further than on my old Pentium: 
   /HOME/MATTHIAS/BATTLESHIP/BATTLE-SHIP.SS: 37.61-37.64: UNBOUND SIGNATURE NAME: WX^

   I thought we had agreed that we would get all of MrEd in the MrEd
   language. Where is wx? 

The code is in cs:~matthias/RobbyBS/battle-shop

>How-To-Repeat:

	use the code and run
