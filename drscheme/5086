 This is not what happens for me.
 
 1) when I start help desk, the default is "containing match".
 
 2) when I change the popup menu to "exact match" I don't get hits on 
 "documentation", I only get "do".
 
 Perhaps you can explain precisely the steps you took, from a freshly 
 opened help desk (or a freshly opened drscheme if that's what you 
 started from)

 When I open a fresh help desk, the default is "exact match."
 
 Thinking about this a little more, I strongly suspect that this is a 
 problem with OS X choice boxes.  I will claim this bug when I get 
 internet access again.
