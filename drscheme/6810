>Description:
In DrScheme, I like the drop-down in the upper-left "(define ...)",
as a quick way to get to functions.
Myself, I prefer the "sort by name" rather
than "sort by position in file".
Alas, for every single session for every single file, I need to
re-select this option.
Could there be a preference that remembers this between sessions?

I would guess that a single global preference would suffice.

Cheers,
ian

been that way at one point in the past.... oops!)
