>Description:
DrScheme fails to load and halts with the following message in the console:

draw-bitmap in dc<%>: expected argument of type <bitmap% object>; given #f

 === context ===
C:\Program Files\PLT\collects\drscheme\private\drscheme-normal.ss:208:15


DrScheme used to load on the same machine previously and it suddenly stopped exhibiting this behavior. I don't recall making any configuration changes to DrScheme. The problem does not occur in versions prior to 4.2 but is present in prerelease 4.2.1.3. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Launch DrScheme
2. Halts with error message in console
