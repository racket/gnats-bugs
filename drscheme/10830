1. Create and save a teachpack.

3. Select the teachpack you saved.

 Looks like should have been an error of the form "you cannot add two
 teachpacks with the same name" (in the second time you get to step 4).
 Ie, this is a very bad error message.

 Ideally, what I'd want there is the option to completely replace the  
 old teachpack.  (indeed, that's precisely the use case I was dealing  
 with, before I sent the report: I'd made a couple fixes to a teachpack  
 I had installed earlier, and wanted to put them in place.)
 
 Best,
 Jordan

 Does using require not work well for you? That's probably the best thing.

 For modules for my own personal use, sure.  For sending an update to studen=

 (who don't use the module languages), though, I don't think so... (but I di=

 say "ideally." :)
 
 In any case, the "Overwrite?" dialog presents a conspicuous inconsistency
 that's worth addressing one way or the other.
