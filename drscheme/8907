 The one labeled "X options (must precede all other options)" in
 `mred -h'.  Perhaps you omitted them intentionally since they have no
 effect, but the new `-singleInstance' flag does have an effect.  (And
 some people might want it as a default.)  Oh, -display should be
 mentioned too.

 Oh, these are all linux-specific flags. I see.
 
 Matthew: it looks like mred doesn't use cmdline.ss. Is that right? I
 think I can use the help-labels clause to get close, tho. Seem right
 to you?

 Hm. on second thought, I'm not sure of the right way to do this. It
 appears that drscheme doesn't get a chance to process those flags and
 so probably drscheme shouldn't be the one that specifies what they
 are? That is, I'd like to be able to not have to change two places if
 that set of flags change. Is that something that's doable?
 
 I also tried "drscheme -iconic" which didn't signal an errors, but
 also didn't seem to do anything different from not supplying that
 flag.

 Maybe a cmdline version for mred?  Or maybe have mred bind something
 to the description of arguments it deals with, and you use that in
 your use of cmdline?

 Sure, something like that would work.

 I'll have to add something to MzScheme/MrEd that "cmdline.ss" can call
 to get that information.

 Are they there only because some contexts expect X apps to get them?
 If so, the -h (and man page) should say that they're ignored.  Or
 maybe just have mred provide some `global options' value that mred
 apps can inspect and see if they want to respect some things.
