>Description:
In DrScheme, typing Meta-<num>-Enter produces several newlines. If
you do that and then hit undo, DrScheme only undoes the one of 
the newlines, not all of them.

However, if you follow Meta-<num>-= (or any other character, I 
think) with undo, it undoes the entire insertion.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
