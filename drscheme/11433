(define h (make-hash))

and get

procedure make-hash: expects 1 argument, given 0

with "(make-hash)" highlighted.  I press F1.  It seems pretty evident that I want help with the procedure invocation that has been highlighted.  But instead I get the generic help-desk.

In fact, getting help with make-hash is "hard".  Even if I right-click on "(make-hash)", I only get "Collapse s-expression" in the contextual menu.  I have to be sure to move the mouse inside the expression to get "Search in help desk for make-hash".

 At the moment, f1 is a very specific, well-defined thing not a "please
 help me in a good way" kind of thing.
 
 After some thought about this I don't see a lot that can be improved
 in a straightforward manner.
 
 So I think that you should build your own version (use f2 for now,
 say) and when you get it going, we'll switch it out for the current
 f1.
