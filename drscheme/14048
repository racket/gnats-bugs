>Description:
Sometimes, when a program is running in the command window, the ESC key does not work in the associated editor window (it is ignored most of the times: pressing ESC-< inserts <).

With some programs it happens always, with other programs it doesn't happen.  I don't have a small program which causes this to happen.

Later I'll send an example program which causes this.
