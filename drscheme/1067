>Description:
DrScheme makes the names of procedures in error messages into
links that refer to Help Desk.  It doesn't do this consistently.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the Beginner language, type
  (+ 1)
or
  (+ 1 'foo)
in the Interactions window.  Each produces a different error message,
but neither has a link for `+'.  In contrast,
  (car 1)
  (first 1)
both have links for `car' and `first', respectively.
