Solaris
>Description:
If you choose the "Keyword, Index Entry, or Text" option for
Search in Help Desk, you get a bunch of filenames spewed to
stdout, like so:

checking "/home/scheme/plt/collects/stepper/doc.txt"
checking "/home/scheme/plt/collects/texpict/doc.txt"
checking "/home/scheme/plt/collects/userspce/doc.txt"
checking "/home/scheme/plt/collects/xml/doc.txt"
checking "/home/scheme/plt/collects/zodiac/doc.txt"

Furthermore, when I try to subsequently use the bug report
form from Help Desk, I get the following to stdout:

default-load-handler: cannot open file for input: "/home/scheme/plt/collects/help/compiled/bug-report.zo" (24 - too many files open)
  (#%require-library/proc "bug-report.ss" "help") in UNKNOWN
  ((#%require-library/proc "bug-report.ss" "help")) in UNKNOWN

>How-To-Repeat:
Start up x-help-desk.
Type "foot" in search buffer, select the search option for text,
and click on Search.
The text should appear on stdout.
Now go back up to the Help Desk front page and click on 
"Submit bug report".
You should see the error.  Help Desk does not go to the bug report page.

 This looks like debugging code that wasn't turned 
 off.

State-Changed-Why:

fixed, released.

Unfrotunately, help desk's "Text" search searches in the source, not in the 
output text, so searching for "foot" gets lots of missed searches, because
footnote shows up in the source a lot and not in the output. Other
than that both the reported bugs are fixed now.
