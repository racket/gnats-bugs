>Description:
With DrScheme set to use the Expander language, I 
evaluated (lambda (x) x).  The result is a syntax object.
When I click on the displayed wedge, it says the origin
of the object is something to do with the stepper 
collection.  

That doesn't seem right.

 It is saying that the source location is an editor object (presumably
 the definitions window) whose class is in the stepper collection, which
 is, technically, right.
 
 I wonder if the best way to handle this is to make mred aware of
 editors as sources in syntax and somehow get the filename or something?

not a drscheme issue. possibly a mred issue. possibly a non-issue.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:29:40 -0500
Reason>>> mred(?)
BTW, I also think that the filename should be used.  This 
is really confusing, especially for people who play with 
syntax that are already confused.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 02 Dec 2011 18:17:09 -0500
Reason>>> now uses file name
