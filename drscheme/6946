>Description:
At the Brown TeachScheme workshop, several participants
have reported that syntax-highlighting sometimes stops
working in the Definitions window (also possibly in the
Interactions window).  No one has noticed a specific
sequence of steps that reliably reproduce the problem, but
clicking Execute seems to fix it.  The presence of certain
teachpacks might be related.

 Might be unrelated, but I think that this report is not very useful
 anyway...  -- At some point I've noticed that read-only files are not
 colored, probably because the text is made read-only along with its
 colors.  Maybe this also happened here?  (Although I don't think that
 execute fixed it.)

 Could you be more specific on what you mean by ``stops working''?  Do 
 the color cease to change altogether, are bits of the text colored 
 incorrectly, or is something else happening?

 P.S. This is more of a bug hearsay than a bug report, but I don't 
 suppose there is much chance of getting a TeachScheme! student to 
 directly describe their experience with this bug.

 That is almost certainly what happened -- clicking execute locks the 
 editor (stopping the colorer) and if the colors weren't in sync when 
 that happens, it's possible that somehow the colorer didn't get turned 
 back on until the next execute. Right now, that interaction is 
 suboptimal. DrScheme uses `lock' to mean "user cannot type" and the 
 colorer uses lock to mean "don't color". These aren't always the same, 
 however....

Reason>>> Probably drscheme shouldn't use `lock' to keep the user from typing; instead 
it should override some of the can-...? methods.

 My apologies.  The bug report was second-hand and apparently misleading.
 There is no problem with syntax *coloring*.  What "stops working" is the
 gray background highlighting of well-formed s-expressions adjacent to the
 cursor.  I believe I just saw it happen---a user was editing a template in
 a comment box, in which the highlighting was working correctly.  When he
 clicked outside the box and started editing other definitions, the
 highlighting was not working.  Syntax-coloring was still active, and
 parens themselves would flash gray or pink, but the text between parens
 would not stay gray while the cursor was next to them.
 
 Sorry I can't give a better description.  I'll try to keep an eye out for
 the problem and look for a consistent way of reproducing it.
