Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #()))
>Description:
It looks like "Macro Stepper" and "Debug" buttons are not
enabled the right way.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrScheme.

2. Use the Module language.

3. Create a new tab, but go back to the original one.

4. Enter the program
     #lang scheme
     (let loop () (loop))
   and Run it.

     => "Macro Stepper" and "Debug" buttons are disabled

5. Switch to the second tab

     => Unlike the "Run" and "Check Syntax" buttons, the 
        "Macro Stepper" and "Debug" buttons are still disabled.
        That's the bug, I think.

6. In the second tab, run the program

     #lang scheme

     => When it completes, all the buttons are enabled,
        and clicking "Macro Stepper" or "Debug" works fine.
        This seems to confirm that it's ok to debug multiple
        tabs at a time; if not, enabling the buttons is
        the bug.
