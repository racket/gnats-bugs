>Description:
I keep finding myself using C-d and C-e just to switch
between the windows (I know about C-f6, that's just a
little too random for me to remember.)

Anyway, how about this change: if you're not in the
definitions window, C-d just moves into it (showing it if
it's hidden); if you're already in it, then remove the
interactions window.

... But this has the unfortunate by product of reversing
the current meaning of the key.  But scanning the
keyboard, I found that C-j is still available, and can be
used to do the same thing that C-f6 is doing -- and it
even has a nice hook to remember -- `j' for "Jump".

 How about using control-x;o?

 (And, fwiw, control-j is used under mac os x, but it is used for
 something pretty useless.)

 You mean cut & open-file=3F
 
 But seriously, I hate many of the default emacs keyboard chords.
 (Like I said, I don't even like C-f6.)
