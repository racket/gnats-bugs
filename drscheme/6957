>Description:
DrScheme *partially* processes test boxes when inside a #| ... |# context.
If the text box has a To Test but not an Expected, that gets signaled
  as an error.
If the test box contains a syntactically malformed expression, you get a
  READ error.
But if you have a run-time error, you don't get any report.

>How-To-Repeat:
New editor.
#| ... |#
Put a test box in place of ....
To test: (/ 1 0); Execute; error for not having an Expected.
To test: (/ 1 0; Expected: 2; Execute; read error.
To test: (/ 1 0); Expected: 2; Execute; no effect.

 This one's a problem with our infrastructure, I think.

 Probably not drscheme, but it is fine to leave it with me for now.
