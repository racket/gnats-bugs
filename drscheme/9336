>Description:
Whenever I go to DrScheme > Preferences > Editing and delete the "^begin" or "^def" from the "Extra regexp" fields, or type a character and then delete it from the blank field under "lambda-like keywords" I get this internal error message:

preferences:set: tried to set preference framework:tabify to (#hasheq((rec . lambda) (fluid-let . lambda) (call-with-input-file* . lambda) (let/cc . lambda) (module . lambda) (local . lambda) (with-handlers . lambda) (do . lambda) (case . lambda) (lambda/kw . lambda) (class100 . lambda) (lambda . lambda) (Î» . la... but it does not meet test from preferences:set-default

>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
>Fix:
There was a bug in the code that updated the preference. It used the wrong variable (using a loop variable that was searching for a place to put something, instead of using the variable bound to the thing to actually put at that place)
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation.

This could also have been a type error, I believe (number vs regexp-or-false).

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 30 May 2008 16:29:31 -0400
Reason>>> this is fixed and released to SVN.
