 I don't see this problem under linux. Is the interface to something
 platform dependant?

 No it happens on all platforms:
 
  * Open a new DrScheme window
  * Type a character in the def window
  * Click the "save" button
  * Click "Cancel" in the file dialog
 
 I thought this was already a PR, actually.

 It was a different (and closed) PR. I probably should have found this
 problem when I was testing (Lord knows I clicked and clacked
 enough....)
 
 Getting the interface to these little, distributed state machines can
 be quite difficult. Now, the "close the last but unsaved window" dance
 is failing. argh.
