>Description:
Just checked out a fresh copy and built it on OS X
10.4.9.  The installation process didn't associate the
correct icon with the drscheme.app bundle; I'm getting
the OS X default application icon instead.  This certainly
applies to the bundle's icon in the Finder; on one
occasion, a running instance of DrScheme also had the
default app icon in the dock and the command-switcher
window (i.e., that which appears when you hit cmd-tab but
don't release cmd).  After restarting DrScheme, tho, I'm
seeing the correct icon in the dock and command switcher.

 That happens to me a lot.
 
 Re-running setup plt usually fixes the problem (all but this one time
 where I re-ran it 15 times and I still got the bad icon ...).
 
 You can just do "setup-plt -l drscheme" to avoid waiting forever.

 Ah -- good to know; thanks.
 
 Once I saw that the Dock had it right, I just copied and pasted the icon in
 the Finder, so I can't test to see whether setup-plt would have fixed it,
 but I'll keep that in mind for the future.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Richard
