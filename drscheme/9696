Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme\n"))
>Description:
Put this program in the defns window, module language.

Hit run.

Enter `(f 10)' at the prompt.  Hit enter.

Note that there is strange highlighting in the defns window.

#lang scheme

(define-syntax (f stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(f arg)
     (begin (sync (thread (lambda () (raise-syntax-error #f "one" #'f))))
            (sync (thread (lambda () (raise-syntax-error 'f "two" stx))))
            (raise (make-exn:fail:syntax "both" (current-continuation-marks) (list #'f stx))))]))
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The bug was that I was recording the definitions text in a cache when the correct value was the interactions text, meaning that only the second error's source location was going in the wrong place
>Release-Note:
This was not a type error, nor was it a contract violation.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 22 Aug 2008 08:53:17 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN
