>Description:
The flash-matching-paren flash sometimes misses the parenthesis.

>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following into a DrScheme buffer:

 ( + 1 2

When you type a close paren, the parenthesis-flash hilights
the space before "+" rather than the open parenthesis. In
contrast, the backgournd hiliting gray gets it right, hiliting
everything from the open paren to the close paren, as does
backward-S-expression moving.

 This probably the same things as 547.

 Quoting Robert Bruce Findler:

 It seems that 547 is more about a situation where no matching should
 occur at all, rather than a match that misses its mark.
