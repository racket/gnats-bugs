>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
I copied and pasted the contents of a .docx file into TextEdit, then copied and pasted this into DrR's definitions pane.  Then I tried to copy part of the definitions pane, but got an error beep because the "copy" and "cut" commands were greyed.  "Paste" is still enabled, and works, but that's not what I wanted to do :-)

Unfortunately, I don't know under exactly what circumstances this happens, so it may be difficult to replicate.

 Was anything selected when you clicked on the edit menu? Was the focus
 in the definitions window (the focus can sometimes be on a button
 depending on how the os is set up)?

 Yes, the focus was definitely in the definitions window, at least  
 sufficiently that I was able to select a region of text by mouse- 
 dragging.  Which answers the other question: a line of Racket code  
 was selected (i.e. highlighted in blue, not just shaded in gray).

 The greying out is just calling the can-do-edit-operation? with 'copy
 and 'cut depending on the menu item in order to determine if it is
 disabled. Straightforward manipulations of the editor seem to work
 fine wrt to this.
 
 So I think we need more to go on, or we should just close this one.

 Oh, in case it matters, I tried the keyboard shortcut for "copy"  
 first, it beeped at me and didn't copy, and then I looked at the edit  
 menu and saw that "cut" and "copy" were both grayed out.
