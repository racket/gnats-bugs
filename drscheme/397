>Environment:
Solaris
>Description:
1. See ~matthias/docs-*.ss

2. run drscheme 

3. open docs-lib.ss

4. open new unit: docs-test.ss

5. change language to intermediate

6. hit execute

Effect: DrS gc's every few seconds, execute remains "lowered", 
DrS accepts no more commands and seems to be in an infinite loop
(no watch cursor)

I have repeated this twice now.

There is no ~matthias/doc-*.ss. However if there was I would ask you to
please narrow down the expressions involved until they fit reasonably into
the pr....

 Thank you very much for your problem report.
 It has the internal identification `all/397'.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

Oops, wrong responsibility. 

Anyways, After getting the files from Matthias, I have narrowed down the
criterion for reproducing the bug to this:

1) set the language level to intermediate
2) set the library to a file containing:

(unit/sig () (import (P : plt:userspace^))
  
  (P:wx:message-box "about to append")
  (P:append! (list '<html>) (list '<html>))
  (P:wx:message-box "appended"))

3) click execute

The second message box never appears.

State-Changed-Why:

Fixed for next (internal) release. The bug is the rice-defs append! was
always an infinte loop. For now, avoid that primitive and you will be
fine. (use #%append! temorarily, or change the imports on the library)
