Linux
>Description:
The window created by a call to open-viewport is larger in x and y
by roughly the width of a scroll bar than the requested size. The
excess is the same in the x and y dimensions. This worked fine under
version 49.
>How-To-Repeat:
(open-graphics)
(define *arena*
   (open-viewport "Arena" 500 500))

((draw-solid-rectangle *arena*)
     (make-posn 0 0) 500 500 (make-rgb 0.5 0.5 0.5))
