>Description:
I get the following error message when I attempt to copy and paste
(using the highlight, middle-click copy and paste) text while my 
code is highlighted and arrows are drawn:

procedure application: expected procedure, given: #<struct:var-arrow>; arguments were: #<void>
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter code in definitions that will draw arrows: 
(define (a b) (a b))
Press check-syntax
Tack an arraw on a or b
Copy the code, and try to paste, using the mouse
>Fix:
This is a classic type error. I introduced a hole in the scope of a variable accidentally and didn't fix up the references.
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation, but probably could have been detected statically.
