>Description:
When I check-syntax (define (f x) (f x)) in beginning student, and
then select f at it's definition to rename it, I am presented with
two "rename f" options. If I select the top option, all is well. If
I select the bottom option only the definition and not the use 
changes leaving me with (define (f1 x) (f x))


>How-To-Repeat:
Switch to beginning student (or beginning with list abbreviation)
type (define (f x) (f x)) 
check-syntax
attempt to rename f at the definition point

State-Changed-Why:
    fixed and released to CVS.
    
    the problem was in the expansion of `define' in the beginner
    language. It produced an original identifier that wasn't really
    original and check syntax was offering to rename it. (That the
    identifier had the same name (it was uninterned) as the original
    definition but didn't bind the same things was unrelated to the
    problem, per se)
