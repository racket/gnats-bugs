Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 00:39:43 -0500
Reason: I don't know where these descriptions are written, but I 
didn't grep because it seems like this would be a good 
chance to add a description to this that says that the 
first argument is turned into a string using expr->string 
(and I'm not sure wheather this should be documented 
behavior...)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 12 Mar 2005 08:03:03 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released.
