>Description:
See below. A kill restores the window, but only if you select
"Kill" from the "Scheme" menu. You should be able to hit "Stop"
and have DrScheme eventually ask whether it should kill.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme on Mac OS X
Hit F5 
Very quickly, hit Cmd-B
If you're fast enough, DrScheme might stop with
 ../../../collects/drscheme/private/rep.ss:1028:13: user break
at which point only the "Stop" button is enabled, but clicking
"Stop" just beeps.
>Fix:
There were two bugs (I found):

1) the dispatch-handler for the user's program (which just has the job of enabling/disabling breaks) was being set too early, so queue'd callbacks that were supposed to just setup the user's setup were actually being run with breaks enabled. 

2) the break button callback was looking at the value of the user's eventspace from the get-breakables method after asking the question about kill/break. Since the breakables are only set up when evaluation is happening (so that that button can be used by all tools) the kill was ineffective. The sequence of actions went goes something like this: tell the GUI that the break button should operate on the user's thread. run a little code. tell the GUI that the break button shouldn't do anything (since the evaluation has happened). But, before the third step, the "ask about kill" dialgo appears (at the user's request). By the time the user says "yes, kill" the third step has happened, so the kill does nothing. That fix was easy -- just record the thing to be killed before opening the dialog.
 
>Release-Note:
There was a kind of off-by-one contract, ie you saw the break exception happening in th user's program, due to a bug in drscheme. I'm not sure that that counts.

 I think I've fixed it. Do you mind trying it out? (checked in).

 Oh, duh. YOu're sleeping. I'm going to close the PR. I'm pretty sure I
 found the right fix to the problem.
