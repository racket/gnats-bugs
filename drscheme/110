>Description:
	
Check syntax generates output when run.
For example:

followed to: 1 - 7
#(struct:symbol #(struct:origin source source) #(struct:location 0 1 1 #<object:wx:media-edit%>) #(struct:location 0 6 6 #<object:wx:media-edit%>) define define ())
followed to: 16 - 22
#(struct:symbol #(struct:origin source source) #(struct:location 1 4 16 #<object:wx:media-edit%>) #(struct:location 1 9 21 #<object:wx:media-edit%>) lambda lambda ())
followed to: 32 - 38

Furthermore, I was able to generate internal errors from check
syntax, but now I can't repeat it.  I'll keep trying.

>How-To-Repeat:

Well, I thought it did this on virtually every program, but
now I'm having some trouble repeating it.  It does produce 
output when using letrec.  For example:

(letrec
    ((loop
      (lambda (n)
	(if (= n 1) 'done (loop (- n 1))))))
  (loop 10))
