Dear Sir or Madam,

today we found out, that there is a strange start-symbol when starting DrScheme. Another one than before. We changed the system-time and so we got out, that it's only on March 2nd.
Is there a special reason for this? I couldn't find out anything from Google or somewhere else.

Yours faithfully,
Florian Wirth

    Same as 6735,
    which is not a bug.

 This is just an easter egg that is triggered on the Texas independence
 day.  See the mailing list for more details...
