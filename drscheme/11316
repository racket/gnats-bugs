>Description:
A "Clear Find" button next to the Find field at the lower left-hand corner of the screen would be very helpful. Currently, the only way to clear the pink ovals around each instance of the found text is to go into the field and delete the text there. This is both counterintuitive and a waste of keystrokes/mouse clicks (get-focus/delete/delete/delete... or get-focus/select-all/backspace). A "Clear Find" menu item would also be helpful.

 I guess it does (though that was not intuitively obvious to me), but it also 
 closes the Find window, which you may not want to do because:
 a) keeping it open reminds you of your last search and
 b) you may want to do another search soon, in which case you need to do an extra 
 keystroke or mouse click to open it up again
 
 Also, there is no menu item for Hide Find as there is for Hide Replace. The 
 inconsistency is puzzling.
 
 Thanks for the reply,
 Alan

 Thank you for the recommendation.
 
 Matthew: is it possible to put shortcuts that don't have the menu
 keybinding prefix into a menu?

 Good to know. I'll do that in the future. I would also recommend adding "'Hide 
 Find' Esc" to the "Edit" menu.
