>Description:
If you start DrScheme with no file, start a loop in the
interactions window, then try to open a file, DrScheme
gets confused. 

DrScheme thinks that it has opened the file, but since the
definitions window was locked, the file's content isn't there.
(Revert gets the content, but trying open again doesn,t
which is that much more confusing until you realize what's
happened.)
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.

    fixed, released.
    
    talk about corner cases.
    
    in this case, drscheme now opens a new window.
    
    if `lock' trigger a state variable that caused a
    contractual failure, this would have been a contract
    error, instead of the wierd behavior Matthew saw.
    
    Making lock'd editor trigger this contractual error
    would not be a small task, however, since some edits
    (like the user typing) should be silent failures and
    others (access thru scheme-level methods) should
    signal violations.
