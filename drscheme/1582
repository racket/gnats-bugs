 Thanks for the bug report.
 
 Right now, you must be running Help Desk from within DrScheme and the
 font size configuration for DrScheme itself also controls the size for
 Help Desk. 
 
 We are working on a rewrite of the browser in Help Desk, which will
 have better configuration for the font sizes.
