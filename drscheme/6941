>Description:
Inserting a graphical lambda (from the Special menu)
causes problems with the syntax highlighting and
paren matching on the remainder of the line; see
below for details.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Ensure that on-the-fly syntax coloring is enabled.

2) Put the following in the definitions window.

  (map (lambda (x) x) '(1 2 3 4 5))

where `lambda' is actually the graphical lambda character,
not the 6-letter word.

3) Enjoy the pretty colors.

4) Comment out the line with a couple of semicolons
at the beginning.

5) Enjoy the pretty colors.

6) Realize that you shouldn't be enjoying the pretty colors.
It colors the "(map (" correctly for a comment, but
leaves the colors intact on the remainder of the line.

7) Put point at the end of the line; notice that
the last paren is highlighted in red.

Any text on subsequent lines is unaffected.

 FWIW, I suspect this is related to Scott's colorizing code.
