>Description:
Open collects/drracket/private/expanding-place.rkt (the file is just an example).
Wait for online check syntax to run.
Right-click on the reference to `set-basic-parameters/no-gui', and choose "Jump to definition".
This will open eval-helpers.rkt, and run the full check-syntax coloring.
Go to the end of the line, hit Enter.

Now the bugs appear:
 - first, the cursor goes to column 0, not the proper column for the indentation.
 - second, if you start typing, it appears all in black, rather than being syntax-colored.
 - third, the check-syntax coloring does not disappear from the rest of the file.

 Thanks. FWIW, this is an interaction between online check syntax and
 regular check syntax (which gets triggered by the jump to definition
 callback). I need to make them cooperate properly.

 Something along those lines to make things more smooth, yep. The "jump
 to definition" actually has to have a check syntax'd buffer to know
 where to jump to, so there is some plumbing to redo.

 One possibility would be just not to trigger regular check syntax,
 since we now have online check syntax, right?  That would have the
 advantage of being faster, since it doesn't do the re-coloring.
