 I routinely use drracket in this configuration (well, not a 17 inch
 mac pro, but on a mac running snow leopard) and don't see these
 crashes. Is it possible there is somethign else special about your
 configuration that could help us understand?
 
 Also, as far as the two program goes, they are the same. See also here:

 Do you get a crash report? Do you see anything in the logs in the
 Console application (in the Utilities folder)?

 It looks like little snitch is causing you problems. This web page:
 
   http://ringo.net/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=3228.0
 
 suggests uninstalling and reinstalling it. I have no idea if this is
 connected to the problems you're seeing with drracket.
 
 You might also try disabling the special things you have installed and
 see if that helps.
 
 Sorry I don't see anything particuarly telling.

 As far as this secondary item goes, I'd like to reiterate my support for =
 adding something to the README explaining the profusion of apps in the =
 distribution. When I first opened the new racket bundle, I read the =
 README *myself* looking for some explanation, and I'm one of the =
 developers, for heaven's sake.
 
 How about something like this (last two bullets are new):
 
 Important executables:
 
 * DrRacket: Racket's integrated development environment (start here!).
 
 * Racket: the main command-line entry point for running racket programs
   and scripts.
 
 * GRacket: the GUI-enabled Racket executable.
 
 * raco: Racket's command-line toolset.
 
 * DrScheme: another name for DrRacket (preserved for compatibility).
 
 * MrEd.app: another name for GRacket (preserved for compatibility).
 
 David, would something like this have answered some of your questions?

 (BTW, it sounds better to consolidate them into a single entry, and
 also add the mzscheme executable to the list.  But I have no opinion
 for or against adding this.)

 For point 3, you might just need to re-install the teaching (new
 versions require you to reinstall teachpacks, in general).
 
 And, to the larger concern: we do try as best we can to avoid
 incompatibilities, but it is not always possible, since we do make
 changes generally throughout the codebase. So, if I were you, I would
 let students use the latest version, but I would make a note somewhere
 about which version is known to work when you developed the examples,
 and keep that in mind as a fall back (since old versions are easy to
 install).
 
 Hope that helps.

 Hi, folks;
 
 Sorry for the delay in responding;=20
 we had commencement activities
 over the weekend.
 
 I have three items.
 
 1.  The quitting-early behavior.
 
 I re-downloaded and re-installed
 the Racket package, and since then
 I haven't been able to reproduce the
 problem.  Everything seems to be
 working as expected.  So I'm=20
 prepared just to write it off, unless
 there's some further follow-up you
 want me to try.
 
 2.  DrRacket, DrScheme, and package
 documentation.
 
 John suggested including this line in
 the top-level README file:
 * DrScheme: another name for DrRacket (preserved for compatibility).
 I think this would have resolved my
 confusion just fine.
 
 3.  DrRacket/DrScheme compatibility.
 
 I'm a little concerned that there will be
 minor mechanical gotchas in using my
 current course materials with Racket.
 I'd really like to avoid having to retest
 every little example program or custom
 teachpack.  Here's one example of=20
 something that I ran into:  I have a little
 example program that does some text
 I/O using a teachpack that simply says
 	(module simple-text-io mzscheme (provide begin read display =
 newline))
 The program works fine when I run it
 in DrRacket.  But I tried Create Executable,
 and I got this dialog:
 
 	DrRacket Internal Error
 
 	call-with-input-file: cannot open input file: 		=09
 	=
 "/Users/dgk/Library/Racket/5.0/collects/installed-teachpacks/simple-text-i=
 o.rkt" (No such file or directory; errno=3D2)
 
 	 =3D=3D=3D context =3D=3D=3D
 	/Applications/Racket =
 v5.0/collects/compiler/embed-unit.rkt:366:4: get-code
 	/Applications/Racket v5.0/collects/racket/private/map.rkt:45:11: =

 	/Applications/Racket =

 	/Applications/Racket =
 v5.0/collects/racket/contract/private/arrow.rkt:1434:3
 =16
 I haven't yet tried to rename my teachpack
 with ".rkt" instead of ".ss".  That's something
 I'd rather avoid doing, since I have other=20
 teachpacks and myriad assignments and
 other documents that use the ".ss" name.
 
 Is there some other way to deal with this,
 maybe enabling some kind of backwards
 compatibility with teachpack file extensions?
 
 Thanks a lot,

 Hi, all;
 
 I'm just now following up on an
 issue that I mentioned a few
 months ago:  I can't seem to=20
 get "Create Executable" to=20
 work.
 
 I'm running DrRacket 5.0.1 on
 MacOS X 10.6.4.
 
 I saved the following source
 file as facts.rkt on my desktop:
 
 (define fact
   (lambda (m)
     (cond
       ((<=3D m 0) 1)
       (else (* m (fact (sub1 m)))))))
 (fact (random 100))
 (fact (random 100))
 (fact (random 100))
 
 I run the code and get, as=20
 expected:
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.0.1 [3m].

 1551118753287382280224243016469303211063259720016986112000000000000

 But when I do Create Executable,
 I get this DrRacket Internal Error:

 When we corresponded last on this
 issue (see below), there was some
 thought that teachpack installation=20
 was involved, but of course the above
 code doesn't use a teachpack.
 
 Hope there's an easy answer,

 FWIW, the create executable bug has been fixed (at some point in the
 past, not sure which one).

 Well, I get further than I used to=20
 when I try to create an executable,
 but I still don't get something that
 works.
 
 When I run this code:
 
 ; fact: number -> number
 ; Compute n-factorial
 (define fact
   (lambda (n)
     (cond
       ((=3D n 0) 1)
       (else (* n (fact (sub1 n)))))))
 (map fact (build-list 10 identity))
 
 in DrRacket [5.0.2, MacOS X 10.6.5],
 I get
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.0.2 [3m].
 Language: Intermediate Student; memory limit: 1024 MB.
 (list 1 1 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 362880)
 >=20
 
 When I do Create Executable, it creates
 and saves a .dmg file with a fact.app file,
 but when I launch the app, it just launches
 (displaying "fact" in the menu bar) and
 returns, displaying nothing.
 
 I get similar behavior with #lang racket
 programs and with teachpacks that do
 interactive, text-based I/O or animations.
 I can send that code along if you like.

 I'm not completely clear on the details as to why myself, but I think
 that if you want to see stdout, you have to run from a Terminal
 window.
 
 Inside the .app bundle (aka directory) you'll find (a few directory
 levels deep) a regular binary that you can just run if you want to see
 stdout.
 
 I'm pretty sure that this is a non-optimal solution, but I'm not sure
 that we can do better in the short term.
 
 If it matters for your classroom, perhaps you should try using the
 universe teachpack (to get GUI programs) or the module language, where
 you have more flexibility with the kinds of applications you can
 create (and thus get something that runs at the command-line more
 conveniently).

 Hi; thanks for the quick response.

 When I try to Create Executable from
 a file with #lang racket (instead of a
 student language), I get a little dialogue
 box that asks for the type of executable
 (I choose "Distribution") and the base
 (Racket or GRacket).  
 
 If I pick Racket, then instead of a
 whatever.app icon (that, when clicked,
 launches and quits right away), I get a
 folder that contains bin and lib subfolders.

 Right.  In that situation, the code works
 as expected in the Terminal window.

 I'm not desperate for an optimal solution
 in the short term; I won't be teaching this
 for a while.  But I'd really like an optimal
 solution (where a student can click
 Create Executable and seamlessly get
 an app that can be double-clicked to
 run on somebody else's machine) some
 day.  
 
 (Students are already skeptical about 
 learning a language they've never heard
 of.  It significantly bolster's Scheme/Racket's
 credibility if students can write code, turn
 it into an app, and distribute it to their friends
 and relatives seamlessly.)

 I'm satisfied enough with the kinds of
 programs they can write on their own
 machines with Racket installed.  I'm
 trying to give them a connection to the
 rest of the real world.
