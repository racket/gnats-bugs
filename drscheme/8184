 While fixing this PR, I've stumbled across some strange behavior. It
 seems that map-function is being called with a strange string:
 
 (map-function "\u001F" "undo") "\u001F"
 
 Is that intentional? If so, what key is that supposed to be? It prints
 out as blank space in the keybindings dialog.

 This is probably a character generated by some option combination (on
 U.S. keywords); in that case, it's presumably an attempt to match some
 Emacs meta combination. I have no guesses on which one, though.  :(
