>Description:
There's a slight error in the syntax highlighting logic: keywords are highlighted as keywords, even when they're symbol literals.  See below for details.
>How-To-Repeat:
Change your color preferences so that keywords and symbols appear different (e.g., make keywords boldface).  Ensure that real-time syntax highlighting is enabled.  Then type 'lambda in the definitions window; note that the six letters in lambda are highlighted as keywords, even though they're quoted.  I'd expect them to appear as symbols (or, for that matter, even as constants, but that's a separate issue).

This happens in Beginning Student, Module, and Textual languages, so it's not a language-dependent issue.

Reason>>> The keywords in Scheme aren't connected to an expansion of the language, 
they're just special symbols. Maybe someday expansion information will
be available to the syntax colorer. Not today.
