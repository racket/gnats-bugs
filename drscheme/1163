 Perhaps it printed:
 
   open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/home/scheme/plt/collects/mysterx/
   doc.txt/doc.txt" (20) 
  
 in the stdout window? In general on unix, watch stdout for error messages.
 
 I have seen this error myself, but it appears to be intermittant so I
 have not been able to find the bug.

 The bug is still there.
 
 Open x-help-desk.  Search for cgi.  In the resulting list, click 
 on cgi-error.

>Unformatted:

Shriram reports:

When I type in "url" one of the entries is

  In net collection
    url in doc.txt

When I click on this, or the entries below it, I get an error saying
Help Desk is trying to open the file

  /home/scheme/plt/collects/net/doc.txt/doc.txt
