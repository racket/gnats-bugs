>Description:
On windows with the default shortcuts there doesn't seem to be a way to quickly toggle commenting of selected regions. This should work like similar functionality in text editors where the commenting is toggled on/off when repeatedly pressing the shortcut.

Reason: I find that repeatedly navigating the submenu entries to comment/uncomment is annoying when playing around with new code, especially bc. I tend to hit the box commenting one which I don't want.

 How about 'alt-r' (I think: to open the "Racket" menu), followed by 'c'?
