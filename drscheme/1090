 That's DrScheme concise way of making a philosophical statement.
 
   There will be time, there will be time
   To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
   There will be time to murder and create,
   And time for all the works and days of hands
   That lift and drop a question on your plate;
   Time for you and time for me.
   And time yet for a hundred decisions,
   And for a hundred visions and revisions,
   Before the taking of a toast and tea.

        For laughs, I tried MysterX from DrScheme.  When
        I create a MysterX document, the hourglass cursor appears
        but won't go away.  The REPL is still usable.
 
 I found a way to make the problem go away, by commenting out code
 which starts up a Scheme thread that repeatedly calls a 
 Windows message-processing loop in the extension.  In the 100 release, 
 many such threads might be started, but currently, only one is.  
 That doesn't fix the problem, however.
 
 Simply calling code in the extension does not cause the problem;
 nor does firing up a Win32 thread in the extension.  Merely
 firing up a Scheme thread doesn't cause the problem, either.
 
 My guess is that the problem is starting a Scheme thread which 
 repeatedly calls extension code.  I'll have to verify this,
 but it appears to be the right trail.
