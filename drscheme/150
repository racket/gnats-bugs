>Release:        unknown
>Environment:
	DrScheme -x, Windows NT
>Description:
	In DrScheme, when a `load'ed file contains a syntax error,
an error is reported but the call to `load' returns and execution
continues.
>How-To-Repeat:
	Evaluate (load "x.ss") 7, where x.ss contains a syntax error
(and no runtime errors before the syntax error); the result is 7.
>Fix:
