>Description:
	When a non-main thread encounters a run-time error, the correct
source location is not hilighted. (It isn't clear to me whether it should.)
When a non-main thread encounters an error while the main thread is
evaluating an expression after the one that created the thread, the
exception handler for catching zodiac/aries errors gets confused.
>How-To-Repeat:
	(thread (lambda () (sleep 1) (car 0)))
        (let loop () (loop))

fixed in next release.

I do hilite errors in non-main threads for now. I see why you might not
want that (ie you're typing and *boom* your cursor is zapped over there)
but for 210 I think you want it, since threads will only really come in
when the 210 user is using a gui library and supplies a function that is
called on a button callback.
