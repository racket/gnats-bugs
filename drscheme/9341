>Description:
The light-purple "answer-comes-from-here" arrows only highlight the first
right-hand-side in 'case' expressions.  
>How-To-Repeat:
In advanced, use Check Syntax on this code:

(case 'b
  [(a) 13]
  [(b) 14]
  [(c) 15])

(cond 
  [(eq? 'b 'a) 13]
  [(eq? 'b 'b) 14]
  [(eq? 'b 'c) 15])

Put the mouse on the left-paren before the case, see only one arrow, put the mouse on the left-paren before the cond, see three arrows (correct).

Not a high-priority item from my standpoint.

Reason>>> 
This now works.

But there is an underlying problem that probably won't get
fixed; you can see a note about it in the code here:

 I guess that something has changed about the expansion of 'case'
 expressions because now they work with the current code.
 
 (There probably are still others that don't work.)
