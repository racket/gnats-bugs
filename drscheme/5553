>Description:
when i reindent all with some large semicolon letters in my
program all of the large letters' charecters get pulled over
to the left margin. i suggest that you add a line of semicolons
along the margin or maybe put them in a box of semicolons.
>How-To-Repeat:
insert large letters. the best ones to example my problem would
be a word where there is a tall letter after a short one. the
top part of the second letter will get reindented all the way
over to the left margin.

insert "scheme"
goto menu->scheme->reindent all

the top of the h flys over to the margin

 Several people have asked for this -- I never did it because it was too
 ugly, but I guess I will do it now :(
