>Description:
Running the program below in DrScheme results in a crash.
Maybe it has something to do with member, since uncommenting
the line marked with BOMBS and using #t instead results
in a non-crashing program.

 It runs out of memory, right?
 
 We really need to get some form of memory limits into DrScheme...

 I'm not sure. The alternative version, where (member ...)
 is replaced with #t ought to use more memory, but that
 nevertheless it runs fine.

 I haven't yet understood the code, but my guess is that a circular
 structure is bring created, so that an `equal?' test (in `member') goes
 into a non-tail loop. If you get rid of the `member' call, then there
 are no `equal?' tests left.

 I can see this post didn't make into the bugs site:
 
 Jens Axel -> Matthew
    I think you're right. The data comes from a site that ranks actors
    after "famousness". The file contains pairs of actors, the
    first more famous than the second. However it is possible that
    the site changes the ranking of the actors due to user feedback.
    If a reordering has happened, a cycle is possible.
 
    Thanks for the insight,
    Jens Axel

Reason>>> drscheme ran out of memory.

There is now a memory limit in the gui that should help w/ this.

 Ah, okay. Then the memory limit should take care of things.
 
 I'll close the PR.
 
 Thanks,
