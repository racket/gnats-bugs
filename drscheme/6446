>Description:
The keybinding seems to only work if there is a colon infront of the key that is to be pressed. Thus ":tab" works but "tab" does not. The helpdesk states they should both work but have subtle differences regarding meta keys.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require
 (lib "framework.ss" "framework"))

(define mytext%
  (class scheme:text%
    ;; get-keymaps (-> (listof keymap%))
    ;; the list of keymaps associated with this text
    (rename [super-get-keymaps get-keymaps])
    (define/override (get-keymaps)
      (let ([keymap (make-object keymap%)])
        (send keymap add-function "tab-ahead"
              (lambda (ignored event)
                (write 'ahead)))
        (send keymap add-function "tab-back"
              (lambda (ignored event)
                (write 'back)))
        (send keymap map-function "tab" "tab-ahead")
        (send keymap map-function "s:tab" "tab-back")
        (cons keymap (super-get-keymaps))))
    (super-instantiate ())))

(define myframe%
  (class frame:editor%
    (define/override (get-editor%) mytext%)
    (super-instantiate ())))

(send (instantiate myframe% ()) show #t)

;; 1) execute program
;; 2) put cursor focus in editor.
;; 3) push the tab key.
;; 4) note the absence of any output.
;; 5) change the program by putting a colon infront of "tab"
;; 6) do step 1 - 3
;; 7) note the output

Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 04:58:12 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Sun, 02 May 2004 13:04:06 -0400
Reason>>> drscheme
Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Sun, 02 May 2004 15:03:18 -0400
Reason>>> seems to be a problem keymap%, not the framework.

Responsible changed from "mflatt" to "robby" by mflatt at Mon, 27 Nov 2006 09:46:40 -0500
Reason>>> Seems to be a framework issue. Maybe tab can't
be overridden (and maybe that's documented),
or maybe there's an issue of allowing overrides.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Mon, 27 Nov 2006 09:46:40 -0500
Reason>>> It appears that adding a colon makes the mapping more specific
than an existing mapping from somewhere in
the framework. That mapping seem not to be in the
list of keymaps from `get-keymaps', which
is why consing the new one onto the front
doesn't make it override the existing binding.

 In a scheme:text%, tab is of course bound to indenting.
 
 I'm not clear on what should be happening here -- why is the current
 behavior wrong?
 
 Also, you probably don't want to create a new keymap each time
 get-keymaps is called (I'll update the docs on this point).

 I'm not sure that it is. Maybe the right conclusion is "confusing but
 true".
