Solaris
>Description:
In several dialogs, including the new Help Desk bug report form,
the order of Commit and Cancel is reversed.  It appears that the 
standard is that Cancel follows Commit (OK, Submit, etc.) in top-to-bottom
and left-to-right orderings of buttons.

State-Changed-Why:

I have fixed (not yet released) the buttons in the bug submission form and
the buttons in the unix file dialogs. I don't know of any others, so if you 
see some, let me know.

Thanks,
Robby
