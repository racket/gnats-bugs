>Description:
While a .plt archive is downloaded through "Help Desk",
all other DrScheme windows are unresponsive (busy mouse),
but are redrawn if needed.

After download, the installation progress window is
displayed but not updated, no windows are redrawn on
request. When the blind install finishes, the progress
windows scrolls to reveal all the installation log
that was not updated earlier.

After all continues as usual.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a large .plt archive (doc) through Help Desk;
Try to interact with other Drscheme windows;
Play hide and seek with xterms to produce redraw events.

 Did you download a single manual, or do a `CVS refresh all manuals'?

 OK, one more question: are you using the alpha19 distribution, or a
 CVS'd version?
