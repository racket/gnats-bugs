>Unformatted:
 ">=", "=" both have correct signature (2+ args), but english description says exactly two args.
 "<=" says exactly 2 args (both signature and enligsh), though beginner-level really does accept multiple args.
 "/" says that its last arg should be non-zero; really, no args except the first should be non-zero.
 "-", "/" don't really give good descriptions of what happens with 3+ arguments; give an example?
 "-": perhaps give the unary version its own paragraph (since +,*,/ don't even have unary versions in beginner)
 "string>-ci?" description contains a literal "<NL>"; the other -ci? functions as well.  (So does "memq", "random", and perhaps others?)
 "exact?" and "inexact?" should occur next to each other, in the page listing all functions? (and near exact->inexact ?)
 "round": it doesn't mention that round-to-even is used.
 "format"s documentation is useless; is this intentional for beginner-level?
