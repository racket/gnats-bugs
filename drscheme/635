>Description:
Whenever I load a file using the (load "*") command, the line number given
by the error message is quite wrong. The line cited is normally quite larger
then the actual position of the error. 
>How-To-Repeat:
To recreate: (smallest scenario)
Create a file with an error on the second line (for instance t).
Load this file in another file as the first line. (Interactions or Definitions.)
The error will be reported as on line 3. 
If the error is moved to line 3, line 5 will be the reported position.
If the error is moved to line 4, line 7 is reported.
If the error is moved to line 10, line 19 is reported. etc.
