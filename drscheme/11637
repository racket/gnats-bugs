>Description:
When I have several saved bug reports, the dialog that asks which one to choose
pops up at the top-left corner of the screen.  This is bad in my case, since I
have the Windows taskbar on the left side so the popup is half-covered by it. It
should instead pop up in the center of the screen or around the mouse.

 This appears to be a problem in racket/gui. The program below should
 open the dialog on top of the frame, but it doesn't (at least under
 windows 7).
 
 #lang racket
 (require mred)
 (define f (new frame% [label "frame"] [width 100] [height 200]))
 (define b (new button% [label "button"] [parent f]
                [callback
                 (=CE=BB x
                   (send (new dialog%
                              [parent f]
                              [label "dlg"])
                         show #t))]))
 (send f show #t)
