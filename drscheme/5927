>Description:
Today, DrScheme backtrace icon is replaced by a face of a man when I made an error. When I pressed the icon, as I did for the bug icon, simply tells that there is internal DrScheme error.

I experienced this on my notebook which runs XP. I tried this on another desktop computer which runs Win2000 and observed the same phenomenon.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme
Choose Language Text
Enter aaa in the interaction box
An icon of a face appears
When pressed, the following appears:
frame:basic-mixin: do not add children directly to a frame:basic (unless using make-root-area-container); use the get-area-container method instead

>Fix:
the fix is to make the message go in the right place!
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation. hard to test for tho.

 Apologies, that should only be a problem on 10/29. The easiest way to
 work around the problem in DrScheme is to change the date of your
 computer.
