>Description:
DrScheme's find (Ctrl+F) tool is annoying:

1. In undocked mode, this is a modal dialog. I think it should not be
   modal.

2. When docked (which is really its only usable mode of operation),
   there is no keybinding to take focus away from the search box. I'd
   like to have similar behavior as in emacs:
   1. ctrl+s (or however you activate i-search)
   2. Type in your search string
   3. If a match is found, type some keybinding (e.g., ctrl+s) to search
      again, or -
   4. type another keybinding to move focus to the window being
      searched.

Item 2 can be implemented by adding keyboard shortcuts to each of the
dock's buttons (Find, Replace, etc.), and adding a separate shortcut to
switch to the main window (e.g., the mysterious undocumented ctrl-x o).

As for Item 1, maybe the undocked mode can be done away with completely.
This would be following the lead of search in Firefox.
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrScheme, press ctrl+F, then click "Dock".
Now type a search term. Other than doing stuff with the mouse, it is
impossible to shift focus away from the search box.
