>Description:
If you use the module browser, you see all the modules required even though they are through libraries and the 'follow lib requires' box is unchecked.  
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The module browser didn't keep up with the new syntax for requires. The fix was just to treat paths that are symbols as if they were lib requires.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor was it a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sun, 13 Apr 2008 09:37:12 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the report.
