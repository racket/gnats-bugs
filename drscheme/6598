>Description:
The colors added by check-syntax don't always respect
my preferences; they use the default colors instead.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. In the prefs box, change the color for lexically
   bound variables (in Scheme, not Java) to something
   beside the default.

2. Close and restart DrScheme.

3. Type the following in the definitions window:

(define f
  (lambda (x)
    (if (zero? x)
        1
        (* x (f (sub1 x))))))

4. Hit check-syntax.  Note that f, x, etc. are all
   colored with the default color for lexically bound
   variables.

5. Open the prefs box.  Observe that the lexically
   bound variables magically recolor themselves to
   the color selected in step 1, before the prefs
   box opens.

Multiple invocations of check-syntax before step 5
continue to produce incorrect results.  Once the 
prefs box is opened, though, subsequent check-syntax
ops do the right thing.
>Fix:
The update of the editor:standard-style-list wasn't happening until
the preferences dialog was opened. In addition, the style list
was being initialized with the value of the default preference, not
with the current value (which are, obviously, different in this case!)
>Release-Note:
The true error was updating the style list with the default pref, rather
than the current pref. I'm not sure how to turn that into a contract
violation, tho.

    Whoops! And I just restructured a bunch of code, partially to fix that
    exact bug! Anyways, I missed a spot. thanks for noticing, Richard.
    It is fixed now.
