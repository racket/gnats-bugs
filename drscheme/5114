>Description:
Retabbing the semicolon patterns created by the "Insert Large
Letters" entry from the edit menu causes the letters to become
horribly scrambled.  Therefore, I think it would be better to 
automatically insert a line of semicolons at the left edge, rather
than having to do it yourself (yes, the "Comment Out" menu option
does make it rather simpler to do this).
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a window.
Choose Edit:Insert Large Letters.
Type "A" in the box, and click OK
Select all text, and hit tab.
Yikes!
>Fix:

>Release-Note:
well, it looks like non-breaking spaces, although they
look right and tab right, don't work with the reader,
since they aren't treated as whitespace, so you get
lots of funny identifiers in the letters.

I'd rather not add a line of semi-colons at the front:
it takes up valuable space and looks ugly.

Think you can just live with it?

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    yes, I thought of doing this, but
    I will probably explore the mred
    version of &nbsp; before I insert
    a line of semi colons at the front. 
    they are so ugly!
