The docs say "For images created with the above primitives, the pinhole is at the center of the shape except for those created from line and text, which have pinholes at the top left." 

This wrong for the example below but I am not sure whether it's a doc or a software bug.

(require htdp/image)

(define ln (line -20 50 'red))
(define xx (pinhole-x ln))
(define yy (pinhole-y ln))

(overlay (circle 3 'solid 'blue) ln)

 Oh -- the pinhole for a line is at the "beginning" of the line. So the
 docs are wrong.
 
 (That's what you're referring to right, not the overlay?)

 Yes, I used the overlay only to find the pinhole graphically.
