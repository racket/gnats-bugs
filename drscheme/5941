>Description:
With the define-datatype construct in EOPL, you usually type things in this form:

(cases mytype v
  (foo (a b c)
    ...
  (mumble (a b)
    ...
  (grunch (a b c)
    ...

But Dr. Scheme doesn't recognize these as built-in syntax, so it tries to guess indenting as if they were functions, something like this:

(cases mytype v
              (foo (a b c)
                   ...
              (mumble (a b)
                      ...
              (grunch (a b c)
                      ...

Can this be changed for the EOPL language package?

Thanks!
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to write a program using define-datatype and cases with the EOPL language package.

 There's no easy way to handle the inner ellipses in your example, but
 if you add `cases' to the preferences dialog in the indenting section,
 you should at least get the cases of the cases to move significantly
 leftward.

    added cases as lambda indenting. other problems are more
    fundamental with the paren matcher and covered in earlier
    PRs. 
    
    thanks for the report!
