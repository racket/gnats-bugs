>Description:
Can we get keyboard shortcuts for Show/Hide Definitions and Interactions?  I know we have C-d and C-e, which are awesome, except they don't work once you turn off keybindings, which any power user is liable to do.  The current interaction pattern of Alt <pause> V <pause> I is pretty clunky, at least on Windows, and on a laptop screen I end up having to type it *all the time*.  

I believe there are several unused F keys -- how about F2/F3, or some other keys that are on the main part of the keyboard?  They can even replace C-d/C-e.

 How about just don't pause? Don't the keybindings "alt-v i" work
 without the pauses?

 Oh, I see. Probably only the first pause is necessary, then?
 
 I think now is the time that I direct you to the keybindings section
 of the drracket manual. Sorry. (Or you can send me a patch if you
 want.)

 No, because alt-v is the reverse of ctrl-v (page back/page forward).
 None (?) of the menu keys work in Windows once you turn keybindings
 off (not surprisingly, because alt-f, alt-e, etc. all have a standard
 Emacs meaning).

 There's an implicit pause in that you can't simultaneously press both.
  You have to hit the keys sequentially.  That's what I meant by the
 pauses.
 
 [Distinct from your keybindings issue, just answering your question.]

 Oh! So you don't really need to pause? Just to release the key?
