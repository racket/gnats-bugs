>Description:
When I start up DrScheme, attempt to modify preferences, 
or search within the help desk, the following error
message appears:
open-output-file: cannot open output file: 
"M:\_LOCKplt-prefs.ss" 
(Access is denied.; errno=5)

The following messages appears at random times:
call-with-output-file: cannot open output file: 
"M:\PLT-autosave-toc" 
(Access is denied.; errno=5)

I am guessing that the problem is access to the 
folder, which is restricted.  I am unsure why DrScheme
is trying to save system files to "M:" when DrScheme was
installed in "C:\Program Files\plt".  

How can I change where DrScheme saves its system files?

 The HOMEDIRVE and HOMEPATH enviornment variables determine where
 DrScheme saves (user-specific) files, such as preferences.
