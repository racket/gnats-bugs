>Description:
The paren-highlighter gets confused even when the comment character
is within a string.

(This may be related to other such problems logged in the past.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Type

  (""

followed by a ) and the parens highlight.  Now type

  (";"

followed by a ) and the paren-highlighter fails to highlight.

Solving context-free problems with regular solutions is bound to fail.

 This is known bug. There is another pr on this one somewhere, I believe.

 Also, When typing this:
 
   #\;
 
 the rest of the line is treated as a comment and parens are not
 highlighted.
