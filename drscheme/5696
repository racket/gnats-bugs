>Description:
By default, DrScheme indents match-lambda like lambda.  Based on the examples in the MzLib manual, I think it should behave more like cond, which means indenting it like begin.  Easy enough to fix, of course, but it might be nice to change the default.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following code in a DrScheme definition window:

(define f
  (match-lambda
     [('foo x y) (make-foo x y)]
     [('bar x) (make-bar x)]
     [bad-input (error 'f "Bad input ~a" bad-input)]))

Select the expression and re-indent it.  Note that the first clause is two spaces to the right of the rest.

State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 28 15:03:58 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    fixed and released. match-lambda and match-lambda* were
    in the wrong default category.
    
    to see the change in your own drscheme, you need to throw
    away your preferences file (or just move match-lambda over
    to "cond-like" in the preferences dialog)
