 Sadly, the teachpack that you wrote here _is_ buggy, it is not 
 well-formed. The problem is that you have that require-library inside 
 a unit, which is not how things work. Instead, you must link in the 
 math library and export it from the compound-unit/sig, as follows:
 
 (require-library "maths.ss")
 
 (define-signature refS (accumulate id 1+ sq fast-exp -1+ cube))
 
 (define refU (unit/sig refS (import)
 
                 (define (accumulate op base term ls)
                   (if (null? ls)
                       base
                       (op (term (car ls))
                           (accumulate op base term (cdr ls)))))
 
                 (define (id x)
                   x)
 
                 (define (cube x)
                   (* x x x))
 
                 (define (1+ x)
                   (+ x 1))
 
                 (define (-1+ x)
                   (- x 1))
 
                 (define (sq x)
                   (* x x))
 
                 (define (fast-exp b n)
                   (cond ((< n 1) 1)
                         ((even? n) (sq (fast-exp b (/ n 2))))
                         (else (* b (fast-exp b (-1+ n))))))
                 ))
 
 (compound-unit/sig (import (PLT : plt:userspace^))
                     (link
                       (math : mzlib:math^ ((require-library "mathr.ss")))
                       (REF   : refS (refU)))
                     (export (open REF) (open math)))
 
 Hope that helps,
