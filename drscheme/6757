Hi.

First, let me thank everybody who worked on DrScheme and all
underlying 'things' because it's really addictive.

Then, I'd like to ask if it would be really difficult to make
the background color of the Definitons and Interaction views
customizable. I personally don't like bright white backgrounds
because I find they cause eye-strains. Moreover, colored syntax
looks better on a dark background (some may find it christmas-
tree-ish, but what's the point of syntax coloring otherwise?).

Thanks again.
