>Description:
Hi,
The program is really good except one really annoying bug.
When coding large programs in definitions window, 
and then running that program (clicking excecute), 
you want your cursor to stay where ever it was in the
defenitions window before the click. This is what happening
indeed. BUT when you click Break button, the defenitions
windows tends to scroll to arbitrary point in the code,
making you to start looking through hundreds of lines for
the function you were working on before clicking "Execute"
and then "Break".
I'm sure that this is very easy bug to fix, and it will
save a lot of frustrating effort just to get back to 
the point you were working on.

>How-To-Repeat:
#| this is a demo code to reproduce a problem.
   just copy all this text into empty defenitions window.
   the put you cursor at marked comment below, follow
   instructions written there.
|#










; put cursor here and click "Execute"
; then click "Break"

























































(define (prompt-for-input string)
  (newline) (newline) (display string) (newline))

(define (announce-output string)
  (newline) (display string) (newline)) 

(define (driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input "Type in something")
  (let ((input (read)))
       (announce-output "You typed: ")
       (display input)
       (driver-loop)
  )
)

(driver-loop)


#| after clicking break, you'll see defenitions window
   scrolling to this area, and not staying at cursor
   position where "Execute" was clicked. Now you have to
   scroll all way back (or forth, you don't really know)
   to find again the function you were working on. When
   there are more than a thousand lines of code, this is
   really frustrating and time wasting!!!

 In fact it doesn't scroll to an arbitrary point, it scrolls to the
 source location of the code that was executing at the time you clicked
 break. I've certainly used this behavior to find out where my infinite
 loops are, and where deadlocks are.
 
 You might try using "kill" which isn't an exception, so the cursor
 doesn't move. The menu shortcut for it under Windows is control-k.
