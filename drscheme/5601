>Description:
There was a really strange interaction between servlet2.ss
and gui.ss. Kyle and Karen were using (make-text "foo")
to create an html text box just like they had done with
(make-password "") and (make-number ""). But make-text is
not defined in servlet2.ss but in gui.ss, so they
were getting a weird error. It was totally
unclear that just the string "foo" would provide a text
box.

Responsible-Changed-When: Thu Jul 11 15:05:28 2002
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    we need to study the interactions between teachpacks. 
    running more than one teachpack at a time poses 
    the language/library interaction problem.
