 Can you point me to a particular link, please? I'm not sure if the
 problem is with the files you got, or if it is a problem with the
 source.
 
 Thanks,

 Paul, this page is fine when I build the docs myself on my machine, so
 it appears that wherever Dave got the docs from is bad. He didn't say,
 but I suspect he got them from the place where your script puts them.

 I don't see any of these bad links in the currently-built tools manual.

 Dave, to get the latest version of the manual, you'd have to delete the
 directory plt/collects/doc/tools/, go to the installed manuals page,
 click on the tools manual and have help-desk re-download the manual. 
 
 Hopefully that will work out for you. Let us know.

 Ok, I deleted /doc, updated my CVS, and now I get two errors.  The
 help desk main screen has:
 
     * Software: How to run programs
       Tour,Languages,Manuals,Release,[Bad manual entry: drscheme::frequently asked questions...
 
 And when I try to download the Tools docs, I get:
 
 Servlet exception: "reference to undefined identifier: make-html-response/incremental"

 That's because that code in the web server is commented out, for now.
 
 Download the .plt file, and use setup-plt to install the documentation
 by hand.
