>Description:
DrScheme runs away with the cpu while evaluating this program:

#lang scheme/base

(require scheme/system)

(let () (system "ls") 14)
                  
(define (gg3)
  (map (lambda (x) (let () (system "ls") 14)) `(3))
  #;(map (lambda (dir)
           (let ()
             (system "ls")
             14))
         `(3 4 5)))


This program doesn't look very tidy, and it's because it suddenly got
squirrely while I was trying to reduce it; deleting the commented-out "map"
expressions results in something that works _fine_. Also, this seems to be 
mac-only, and drscheme-only.  It will also go away if the call to (system
"ls" is tail within the (let () ...), and it will go away if there's no call
to map, and, and, ...  basically, this bug looks pretty icky to me.
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate 

#lang scheme/base

(require scheme/system)

(let () (system "ls") 14)
                  
(define (gg3)
  (map (lambda (x) (let () (system "ls") 14)) `(3))
  #;(map (lambda (dir)
           (let ()
             (system "ls")
             14))
         `(3 4 5)))

In the module language.  For me, this code diverges without even calling gg3.

Reason>>> It works fine for me on linux (in mz or dr) and on OSX (in 
mz).  I'm switching to robby to try dr on osx, but it looks 
like it working fine now.

 John: are you still seeing this problem?

 I can no longer reproduce this bug.  Nice!

Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Sun, 13 Apr 2008 18:39:09 -0400
Reason>>> I definitely didn't change anything.

I'll close this, in addition to switching it to you.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sun, 13 Apr 2008 18:39:09 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew likely fixed this as he fixed other things somehow.
