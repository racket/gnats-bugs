Human Language: english
>Description:
I wonder what the function of the "Next" button is in the "Welcome to DrScheme" language wizard. When I click on English, I automatically go the next page. My intuition with "Next" would be that the English button would appear pressed down when clicked, then I would click "Next" to go on to the next screen. Currently there's no context as to what clicking "Next" would do without having any of the other buttons pressed. I would prefer keeping "Next" and showing the English button pressed down as the default.

 I'm not following. Currenlty, the language that you are in and the next
 button have the same functionality. Buttons don't get pressed without
 you actually clicking on them. Are you thinking of a radio button?
 
 Other wizards let you click next and just take a default action (often
 without even telling you what they are doing). I did that, and it's
 bad, I agree. But, to fix it properly (probably with a radio button)
 I'd need to get my translators going and that takes too long.
 
 Maybe for v202?

 I'd rather force the user to click a language.  Then the user has one
 button to click (the language) instead of two (language and next).
 
 I would just eliminate the next button and leave the language buttons how
 they were.
