(This is probably a triplicate report, but it MUST be fixed
for the release.)

Reason>>> fixed (probably) and checked in to SVN.

I don't know if there is a test suite for check-expect. I
didn't run one. If there is, a pointer would be appreciated.

 There's a test file in tests/profj -- which I'll admit is a non- 
 intuitive location and flat out bad now that profj has come out of the  
 distribution.
 
 I'll move it. Also, I'll be checking on the bug (which was on my  
 agenda for the afternoon, but I was away from e-mail since last night).
