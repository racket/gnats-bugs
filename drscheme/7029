>Description:
Draw a large image. Try to view it piece by piece. It won't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Fire up a drscheme, set teachpack to image.ss, enter
(circle 1000 'solid 'red)
and try to view the big red disk. 
>Fix:
the default scrolling behavior for a snip is that the whole thing is a single
scroll step. So, when a big image was on a line by itself, it wasn't possible
to see some portions of it. the fix was to override various methods to
specify a different default behavior.
>Release-Note:
there were no contract violations. the default behavior was wrong in this
case, but not wrong enough to trigger a contract violation.

 If I understand the complaint, then the snip for images needs to
 override `get-num-scroll-steps', `find-scroll-step', and
 `get-scroll-step-offset'. Otherwise, the entire image counts as a
 single step for scrolling.
 
 The image-snip% class overrides the above methods to include a scroll
 step every 20 pixels.

 That explains why you can't see the bottom of the red disk.
