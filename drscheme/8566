>Description:
DrScheme translates all occurrences of #\u00A0 in its input (either from the keyboard or a file) to #\u0020, while both MrEd and MzScheme preserve the original text.  (#\u00A0 is a non-breaking space; on a Mac, you can generate one of these by hitting opt-space, with the default U.S. keyboard.  #\u0020 is of course the same as #\space.)
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrScheme, type (string->list "aÂ a") at the prompt, using a non-breaking space.  This evaluates to '(#\a #\space #\a).  In MrEd and MzScheme, it evaluates to '(#\a #\u00A0 #\a) -- although to demonstrate this in MzScheme you have to be using a terminal that's Unicode-capable.

Similar results happen when reading from a (UTF-8) file on disk: DrScheme translates each #\u00A0 to #\space, while MrEd and MzScheme keep them as #\u00A0 instead.

Similar results also happen when you type the the string->list expression in the definitions window and hit Run, although of course neither MrEd nor MzScheme has an equivalent.

 This was done intentionally to handle text coming from web pages. We
 used to get "reference to undefined identifier:  " (with a
 non-breaking space at the end) and highlighting on what appeared to be
 spaces when people copied and pasted text into drscheme.
 
 Perhaps another fix should have been adopted? I don't recall the exact
 discussion anymore, just that the conclusion was the behavior Richard
 is asking to change.

 I've removed the special handling (this amounted to just removing two
 mixin applications :).
