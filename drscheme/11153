>Description:
I've discovered that DrRacket appears to freeze completely when running in Debug mode and highlighting text in the definitions window.  The only way I could get things back under control was to end the process using Task Manager.

This is v5.0.1, Windows XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Enter the following code into the definitions window:

(define query-loop
  (lambda ()
    (read)
    (query-loop)))

(query-loop)

2) Click Debug
3) Program execution pauses on the (query-loop) line
4) Click "Go" to continue
5) Using the mouse, click and drag to highlight some code in the definitions window
6) DrRacket freezes, and can only be killed using the Task Manager

 I have also managed to replicate this problem on OS X 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard).

 I looked into this briefly.
 
 It looks like selecting like this is causing the debugger to to try to
 display some values, which causes the debugger to try to evaluate
 something on the user's thread, but the user's thread is blocked on IO
 and so it never responds.
 
 I think that the fix is to change the way the debugger communicates
 with the user's program. It cannot rely on the user's program to be
 doing nothing to be able to communicate back with it. (Also, do
 consider that the user's program may do something like create a few
 extra threads that randomly call break-thread or kill-thread on the
 main user thread -- the debugger should not crash in that case
 either.)

 FWIW, PR 10817 is about that issue --- even when DrRacket kills the
 program.
