>Description:
Clicking on the bug icon in the interactions pane of a project
window produces the following error message, both in an internal
error dialog and on the console:

ivar: instance variable not found: definitions-text in class: project-frame%

>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following in a file:

(define foo%
  (class object% ()
    (public (f (lambda () 3)))
    (sequence (super-init))))

Then add that file to a project.  Execute the project.  Then,
in the interactions window of the project frame, evaluate the
following expression:

(send (make-object foo%) g)

Click on the ladybug icon.
