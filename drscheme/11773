>Description:
After submitting a bugreport, the window reports that you have submitted it and has a close button on the buttom right. If you try to close it other ways (control-w, window manager, or file menu), it asks if you want to save or discard it, even though it has already been sent and the only useful operation on the window is to close it. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Submit bug report.
2. Try to close window without using close button in the bottom right.
