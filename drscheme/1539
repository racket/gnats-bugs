 I cannot find this problem. I found the output of langtab.ss in the
 help desk version of the drscheme manual (the description you give is
 wrong in the PR) but it does not have the problems you describe. I
 manually generated the langtab output files and they look okay, too. I
 checked this in the latest version of the manual (deleted my
 plt/collects/doc/drscheme/ directory and re-downloaded the manual).
 
 So, it looks like there is no problem. Can you double check that you
 have the right version of the manual? Are you seeing this on CS, or
 your own installation?

 I just followed the description I gave in the PR, and don't see a
 problem, but anyway: I am referring to the table of features at each
 language level.
 
 I don't have plt/collects/doc/ checked out, so that isn't at issue.
 Also, this isn't a local copy.  I am running x-help-desk without any
 PLT* settings, ie, from ~scheme.
 
 Just to be sure, I went over to Steckler's office, and he executed
 x-help-desk (running, I presume, on sun, displaying on his Windows
 box).  He too sees the error.  So there is definitely *some* problem,
 and it's not isolated to me.
 
 I will be away for the next few hours, but can (slowly) run stuff from 
 home tonight if you wish.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Shriram
