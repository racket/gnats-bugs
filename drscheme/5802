 Right now, if you type f1, do you get the front page of help desk?
 
 Another option: typing f1 could search for the word at the isnertion
 point in the help system. Would you prefer that?

 Scheme's object system is not as "transparent" as Java's, so coming up
 with the methods for an object is not a decidable question.
 
 Still, I will change the meaning of f1 so that it searches for the text
 under the cursor.
