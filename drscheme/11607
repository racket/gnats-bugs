>Description:
Hi,

Would it be possible to (have an option to) write
expressions prefixed by #; in the comment color and font style?
It would be very helpful.

Thanks,
Laurent
P.S. : I'm not sure if this is the right media for such requests. Would the mailing list be better?

 It has been raised on the list a few times.  I'll repeat my opinion
 for the record (I think that something needs to be done, but see
 below).
 
 I wanted such a feature for a long time, until Emacs added it
 semi-recently, and I discovered that being colored like a comment
 means that the editor will actually treat it as such.  This messes up
 lots of stuff -- like sexp-based navigation, indentation, etc etc.
 Emacs is kind of trying to do the right thing, but in general the
 result is unreliable, which makes the #; thing be very annoying.
 DrRacket will also have issues with comments -- like ignoring them for
 sexpr-based movements and more.
 
 However, last semester I had a case that was a clear indication that
 something needs to be done.  I gave students code that looks like this:
 
   (: eval-body : (Listof TOY) ENV -> VAL)
   (define (eval-body exprs env)
     (blah blah blah)
     #; ; a shorter version that uses `foldl'
     (foldl blah blah blah))
 
   (: get-boxes : (Listof TOY) ENV -> (Listof (Boxof VAL)))
   (define (get-boxes exprs env)
 
 and what happened was that at least three different students just
 removed the `foldl' line, added a ")" on the previous line, and tried
 to run it with the "#;" line still in.  This turns out to be very
 confusing -- the #; comments out the type declaration for `get-boxes',
 typed racket guesses some generic type, resulting in a very confusing
 error message.
 
 So part of that is probably my fault (I see no problems with
 combinations like "#; #; ; text", but some people think that it's
 awfully complicated), but regardless, it would be nice if there was a
 way to have some visual indication of being commented out that
 combines with the usual look (like a different bg color).  But if
 that's too difficult for a quick hack (and my guess is that it is),
 then I prefer the current state over a proper treatment of these
 things as comments.

 hmm, that's not desirable, obviously.

 Maybe just writing the commented sexpr in italics would be a good
 intermediate solution,
 still considering them as sexprs?
 I was thinking about a new line of style definition in the Edit>Color>Racket
 preferences.

 Do you mean the problem is the DrRacket editor is not looking at sexprs for
 coloration
 (though it certainly does for indentation, but that's not the same problem,
 is it?),
 but only at simpler lexical content?

 Truly naively, I don't see a case where using "#; #; " would have some
 benefit over using the #; directly
 before each parenthesis, but maybe this is because of a lack of practice.
 
 I personally would be happy with such a feature that would work only for non
 "nested" #; comments
 (maybe with a warning when checking some option),
 since I don't use them, and I guess few people do (and those probably don't
 need a screen at all ;) ).
 
 
 Anyway, if ever something like this turns out to be implemented one day,
 please drop a line in the mailing list!
 
 Best regards,
 Laurent
