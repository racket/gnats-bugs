>Description:
The documentation for the --auto-else flag suggests that
turning it "on" makes the expression

  (cond [false 3]) 

evaluate to void, and turning it "off" results in an error.
Yet the reverse behavior is true.

Perhaps all this needs is clearer documentation, but the name
of the flag does suggest the behavior is backward.
