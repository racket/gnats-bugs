>Description:
Save the following function into a file:

(define (reduce fun a-list)
  (if (= 1 (length a-list))
      (car a-list)
      (fun (car a-list) (reduce fun (cdr a-list)))))

Startup a new DrScheme process.
In the interactions window, enter the following:

(load <the file you just saved>)
(define (f a b) (cdr a))
(reduce f '(0 1 2))

(Obviously, the result of evaluating the last line should be an error).

A dialog box is displayed with the following message:

send: target is not an object: 
<filename> for method: get-admin

Click ok on the dialog box. Now the Interactions window is frozen.
It's still possible to save Definitions and perform limited 
functionality, but I'm unable to reset Interactions, and DrJava 
quickly becomes unstable.

I can't reproduce the bug unless I load "reduce" from a file; 
defining it in Interactions doesn't work (nor does defining it in 
Definitions and hitting Execute). 

I'm running v204, textual MzScheme v204, on Solaris 5.8 with an 
Ultra 80. I tried submitting this report via the Help Desk, but that
resulted in an error (I'm still investigating):

<snip>
The error message is:
tcp-connect: connection to bugs.plt-scheme.org,
port 1025 failed; host not found (at step 1: errno-?)

 Thanks for the report, Eric. This bug has been fixed in the CVS
 archives; you may want to use that version. It's relatively easy to set
 up:
