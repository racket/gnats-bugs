>Description:
	
I suggest this would be a good time to clean up the Save, Save As,
Open, and Select Library boxes.

Basically, I've always considered the two entry boxes confusing.
The "Open Directory" button is especially confusing because it's 
on the same line as "Name: ... " which only applies to file names,
not directories. 

My wish list:

1. I'd prefer just one entry box and have drscheme test if this
path name refers to a file or a directory (and act accordingly).

2. If a single box is too much to ask for, then at least make it
more clear which box is for directories and which is for files.
I'd put the directory box on top like this:

              +------------------------+
  Directory:  |                        |  [Select]
              +------------------------+
  Filename:   |                        |  [Select]
              +------------------------+

And let's make them the same type of box.

3. If I select a file from the big file list with a mouse click
(and it gets highlighted), then "OK" complains that I should 
select a file.  Yuck.

4. In the directory list (at the top, after "Select File").
It would be nice if it would keep the same list of directories when
I move up the tree until I make a branch.  For example, I get the
list (/ a santa jam krentel), move up to /, and I don't lose 
(a santa jam krentel).

5. Also, I'd put / on top and krentel on the bottom.  Computer scientists
draw trees with the root on top, and / is the high-order part of the
path.

6. I don't see why the Get File and Put File boxes need to be different.
I might want to put to an existing file (overwrite) or an nonexistent
file (create).  It even makes sense to get from a nonexistent file
(create a null file with this name).  I do it in emacs all the time.
