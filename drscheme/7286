The expression (let ([x 42]) x) provokes an "let: bad syntax in: |[x". 
This is probably intentionally, but unconvenient if you want to
run old R5RS code with brackets (or from other Schemes allowing brackets).

An addition extra option in the "Details" section of the "Language selection"
dialog would solve the problem.

 r5 says:
 
   The following five characters are reserved for future extensions to
   the language: [ ] { } |
 
 which suggests (to me, anyways) that maybe we should be treating those
 as syntax errors, instead of making them identifiers.
 
 Section 7 makes no other mention of "[".
 
 What do you think?

 That's probably a good idea. I'll have to add another parameter to
 control MzScheme's reader.

 Instead of a new parameter, how about having this behavior when the
 current read-as parameter has 'error -- this way you can control each
 one separately.

 Thanks, Eli.
 
 I'm not sure what you have in mind for the preference, tho. I don't
 think that the r5 language needs a pref for that.

 Well, the original point was that you might want to run r5rs code that
 does use some square brackets (eg, from other Scheme's) so there might
 be a point in adding a preference.  But feel free to close it -- I
 don't have an opinion, just transferred it for you to decide...

 My interpretation of r5 code is that it can't use those characters, so
 we're doing people a favor by rejecting such programs.

 I typically develop all programs my programs in PLT Scheme. If the
 need for a port arises, I add functions and macros at the beginning
 of the file until it runs in the R5RS language. Then I try running
 it in another Scheme.
 
 As long as I can set a parameter via #%require magic it isn't that
 important with a DrScheme preference. Code from other Scheme normally
 run in Pretty Big.

 I'm not completely following the line of reasoning -- in the r5
 language level there isn't any plt-specific stuff, so that route won't
 work, but it sounds like you're not actually using the r5 language
 level?

 A typical example was the math-repl program I developed for PLT and
 then ported to SISC.
 
 I changed the language setting to R5RS, ran the program, and
 added macros and functions each time I got an error (for "PLT" stuff
 like when, unless, define-struct etc.) until all functions were
 added.
 
 Since SISC can handle brackets, I never replaced the brackets - I like
 them.
 
 I.e. when porting to another R5RS Scheme allowing brackets it is
 convenient that it is possible to get the PLT R5RS to accept them.
 
 That said, I think the decision to turn them off as default is
 a good decision (judging from some c.l.schemers's reactions to
 brackets).

 I hate to be a language lawyer, but technically it isn't ported to r5rs
 if it contains brackets (at least from my reading of the spec). I can
 see why you'd want that, as you seem to be more interested in a least
 common denominator compatibility with SISC, but I'm not sure that I
 have the energy to support that (I barely have enough for r5 itself, as
 is). 
 
 Since it isn't that hard to set up your own language level with your
 own defaults, let me suggest you do that if necc.
 
 Sorry, :(

 That's ok  -  I know how to use #%require to get to the parameter :-)
