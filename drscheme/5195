>Description:
See steps.

There's actually a much worse bug, where expanding
mangles the code, but I haven't been able to construct
a simple, reproducible example yet ...
>How-To-Repeat:
Start with

(define (add-xl-workbook xl)
  (let* ([wbs (com-get-property xl "Workbooks")])
    (com-invoke wbs "Add")))

Position cursor on ( of LET* and collapse.  The code becomes

(define (add-xl-workbook xl)
  (...))

with cursor between the last two parens.
Now move cursor to the beginning of outer exp.
The fragment highlighted is

<(define (add-xl-workbook xl)
  (...>))

where < and > delimit the highlighting.
>Fix:

>Release-Note:
the bug was that the drawing code and the sizing code
weren't using the same font settings, so the sizaing code
said that the snip was smaller than it really is, but
the drawing code was drawing it properly. Sometimes
(since, once in a while, when the cursor was in the
right place, the sizing code accidentally used the right
font).

Unitialized state seems like it should be a contract error!

 Is it safe to conjecture that the reason for this bug is that the
 ellipsis is a single character (it pastes funny -- the bug report
 engine's editor seemed to have some trouble navigating with it in the
 buffer) but takes three spaces?

 Not exactly, but something along those lines. It is a problem with the
 paren matcher and things that aren't string-snips%, I believe.
