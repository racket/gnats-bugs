>Description:
Assuming that after Syntax has been checked the purple arrows show tail positions and assuming that the last expression, say X, of each clause of a case form is in tail position with respect to the case form, I wonder why Check Syntax does not show arrows to the Xs.

In a cond form the arrows are properly shown.

I checked this for #lang scheme, Module and Pretty big.

I make frequent use of check-syntax. It's a great tool.

>How-To-Repeat:
In definitions window:

#lang scheme

(lambda (x)
 (case x
  ((1)
   (add1 x)) ; tail pos not shown
  ((2)
   (sub1 x)) ; tail pos not shown
  (else
    0))) ; tail pos not shown

(lambda (x)
 (cond
  ((= x 1) (add1 x)) ; tail poistion is shown
  ((= x 2) (sub1 x)) ; tail poistion is shown
  (else 0))) ; tail poistion is shown

Check Syntax and move the cursor to the opening parenthesis of the first cq second lambda form.
>Fix:
When chasing tail-links in the fully expanded program, if a link went to or from some code inserted by the expander, it was ignored. But this is wrong if there is some link that goes by multiple steps thru some code inserted by the expander.

So the fix was to insert a variation on transitive closure of the graph that directly connects nodes that pass thru unannotated regions of code.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 17 Apr 2008 07:56:34 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the report!


State changed from "closed" to "open" by robby at Thu, 17 Apr 2008 08:10:33 -0400
Reason>>> I've fixed the symptom in the PR by adding in one layer of
links (as described in the transcript) but adding in all of
the layers of links is way too expensive if done naively, so
I've reopened the PR for now.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 16 Feb 2011 16:25:33 -0500
Reason>>> 
Probably nothing is going to change here.
