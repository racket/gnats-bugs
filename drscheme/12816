>Description:
Had downloaded the nightly tagged 5.3.0.9.
Some line into a new program, Windows 7 shows the usual appcrash dialog.
The DrRacket window shows on the bottom that a syntax expansion "cycle" was starting.
Something like "Expanding syntax".
This happend two or three times, then I disabled online compilation and the issue seems gone.
The time between this happening was subjectively not constant.
The programs where just a couple of defines basically.
>How-To-Repeat:
5.3.0.9 on windows 7 64 bit exhibited this behaviour.
I saved the memory dump and info created by windows:
