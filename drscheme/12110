The save dialog renables hiding of extensions if one changes the extension to something DrRacket doesn't recognize.

Try to save a file as 'a.txt' works, but cannot type 'a.tx', DrRacket always changes it to 'a.tx.rkt'

 I think that this requires a change at the get-file level (or maybe
 just there is a combination of arguments that I didn't figure out that
 does the job).
 
 This one:
 
   (put-file #f #f #f "tmp.rkt" "rkt" '() '(("Any" "*.*")))
 
 has the behavior Eric mentions, namely if you type "tmp.rk" then you
 get back "tmp.rk.rkt".
 
 This one:
 
   (put-file #f #f #f "tmp.rkt" #f '() '(("Any" "*.*")))
 
 has the behavior that if you type "tmp" (with no extension, as mac
 people seem to expect to be able to do), then you get back just "tmp"
 instead of "tmp.rkt".

 Oh, and this one:
 
 (put-file #f #f #f "tmp.rkt" #f '() '(("Racket" "*.rkt") ("Any" "*.*")))
 
 behaves like the first one below.
