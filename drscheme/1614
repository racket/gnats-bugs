>Description:
The "Find in Page" menu item in Help Desk
gets grayed when a non-text control has
the focus. (It should never be grayed, right?)

The "Find Again" menu item in stand-alone Help
Desk doesn't get grayed, ever,
but it may make sense to gray it when
there's no search string.

[The DrScheme Help Desk doesn't have a Find Again
anymore; I'd guess that's intentional.]

>How-To-Repeat:
Start Help Desk in X or Windows
Click on one of the pop-up menus

State-Changed-Why:

The "Find in Page" menu should never get grayed out now (unlike drscheme's
window, which will continue to gray out based on focus).

The "Find Again" now grays out when there is no search string.

DrScheme's help desk window now has "Find Again" (and "Keybindings" -- they 
were interfering before).
