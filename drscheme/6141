Hi,

I recently discovered and downloaded DrScheme to replace Common Lisp in my
Programming Languages course.  If I can get these problems remedied (I've 
tried several language versions and customizations), I would also like to
use this in my AI course.  The DrScheme environment is great!  Problems:

* I can't access the eval function.  I can work around many other "missing"
functions, but not this one.

* I can't find/access begin, c....r (in any uniform way), case, display,
  functions, the if-then form of if, load, member?, newline, set!, string,
  etc.

* Once I use define at top-level, I can neither unbind or re-define.  There
  seems to be no bound? function.

* Dotted-pairs do not seem to be supported.

    Not a bug -- wrong language level setting.

 Use the Language menu to set the Language Level to R5RS, or 
 one of the PLT languages.  You probably have it set to 
 Beginning Student.

 You appear to be in the beginner scheme language. Open the language
 dialog (choose language|language) and choose a more appropriate
 language. Full Scheme should work for you.

 I am using Windows 95.  The download and install were fine.  I am using 
 Intermediate Student with Lambda
 Not case sensitive
 Output Syntax:
    Output Style - Write (It took me a LONG time to hit on this)
    Fraction Style - Repeating Decimals (Reduced rationals preferred :))
    Insert NewLines in Printed Values
 
 I hope that is enough information.
 
 Thanks for your help.
