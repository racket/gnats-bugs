>Description:
(as in summary)
>How-To-Repeat:
enter fraction into interaction window then
attempt to copy/past resulting printed result.

>Fix:
the bug: the snipclass wasn't registered with the
snip-class-list. Somehow that line got deleted
from the fraction snip implementation.

This could have been a contract violation -- right now
mred complains if you insert a snip into an editor
without  it having a snipclass. It doesn't, however,
check to make sure that the snipclass is actually
registered somewhere, but I believe it could.
