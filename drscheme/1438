>Description:
suppose you want to indent a single function 
  (for example, because of the preceding bug report)
and use ctrl-n (for next line) and ctrl-i for TAB 
because this easily rolls of your fingers

then you dont get the desired result of an indented
function. instead the cursor appears, disappears, 
and all of that on an irregular basis.

 control-i is already bound to "set focus to interactive search buffer".
