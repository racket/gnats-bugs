 This bug might be a problem with the initial value for a newly
 inserted/created snip's style. So, I'm trying to understand from the
 docs how that happens. I found this para in the docs:
 
   Usually, when text is inserted into a buffer, a it inherits the style
   of the preceeding snip. If text is inserted into an empty editor, the
   new snip is usually assigned a style called "Standard". By default,
   the "Standard" style is unmodified from the root style.
 
 (this is from the Styles overview of the mred manual).
 
 This doesn't cover the "unusual" case when set-styles-sticky is #f and
 there are snips in the "buffer". What happens then?
 
 Also, I think that "unusual" could be explained better and "buffer"
 means "an instance of the editor<%> interface". Does `insert' means
 with the `insert' method or something else?
 
 Perhaps the above paragraph and the one that follows it were not
 revised when set-styles-sticky was added?
