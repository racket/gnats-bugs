>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
Repeat instructions: 

1. Open large file (i used an interpreter for AlmostIntermediate, 
   some 500 lines). 
2. Split screen. 
3. Show contour. 
Assert: now you see the top of the file twice, and the contour
says so (the blue is at the top). 
4. Go down to the end of the top buffer, use esc >. 
5. Type random chars quickly or whatever. 
Watch: 
 - chars show up slowly
 - the blue in the contour jumps back and forth between top and bot

Perhaps we should turn this into a bug report now and let it rest.
