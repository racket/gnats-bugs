>Description:
I started Help Desk from DrScheme.
It told me "something's wrong", and
I clicked on the link to download the
docs.  When that was done, I closed
Help Desk, and restarted it.  I still
got the "something's wrong" page.

Restarting DrScheme fixed the problem.
If restarting is necessary, the "something's
wrong" page should mention that fact.

As above.
