>Description:
1) When an XML box contains a splicing Scheme box
that procuded a non-list, a suitable error message
is given, but with no source location.

2) A splicing Scheme box outside an XML box seems to
behave the same as a (non-splicing) Scheme box. Is
that the intended behavior?
>How-To-Repeat:
Create XML box
in teh XML box, put a splicing Scheme box
put 'x in the splicing Scheme box
execute

 I think that they should behave the same, yes. But, I think that they
 should probably both be syntax errors.

 I'm not sure about this anymore. Point 1) has been fixed, but for point
 2) I don't know what is the right solution. What do you recommend?

 I think that using a splicing box in a Scheme context should probably
 be an error, but I also suspect that we're missing a general framework
 for these kind of connections.

 What about a regular box?

 Yes, I agree. It should work like the , works -- but since it is
 graphical syntax, we're not there yet.
 
 I'll leave the PR alone foe now.

 Seems fine to me, and even potentially useful.
 
 For a short time with Slideshow, I put code typeset by the `code' macro
 in its own Scheme box to visually distinguish it from normal code.
