 By crashes, do you mean that it produces an error?  Exits?  Segfaults?
 
 Can you also provide any error messages or output that it might have produced?

 Just to confirm, you select "Preference" and all of DrRacket just
 disappears, with no messages?

 When I start drracket in a terminal and then select Edit > Preferences I 
 get the following output in the terminal window:
