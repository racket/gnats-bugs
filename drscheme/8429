>Description:
consider the following source code...

#|...................................................|#
(define dirEntered "")

; prompts user until a valid directory is entered
(define (promptForDir)
  (display "enter the directory: ")
  (set! dirEntered (read-line))
  (unless (directory-exists? dirEntered)
    (begin
      (display "error: the directory with the name ")
      (display dirEntered)
      (display " was not found")
      (newline)
      (promptForDir))))

(promptForDir)
#|...................................................|#

This executes as desired in the IDE, but when you make an executable and run it from the command-line interface, something severe goes wrong with the code under 'unless'- the part enclosed in 'begin.' The message that is supposed to be displayed is "error: <dirEntered> was not found," but instead, it displays deranged, nonsensical text.  I checked to see if the string was being properly stored in dirEntered, and it is.  So I don't have a clue what is causing this.

>How-To-Repeat:
Execute the above code.  To really see this error, type the name of a LONG, VALID, and EXISTING directory name.  The bug will occur with any entry, however, it is easier to see when you enter a longer directory string.  This problem happened with other similar programs of mine that use the same function promptForDir();

 The problem is the read-line in:
 
    (set! dirEntered (read-line))
 
 The console and DrScheme treats line breaks differently.
 
 A solution is to write
 
    (read-line (current-input-port) 'any)
 
 in order to handle both cases at once.
 
 See section 11.2.1 in "PLT MzScheme: Language Manual"
 for more info on read-line options.
