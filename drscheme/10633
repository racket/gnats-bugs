>Description:
This seems to be a bug in mrlib/image-core.ss.  When a bitmap that has no mask is scaled, displaying the resulting image applies the draw-bitmap operation to #f, crashing DrScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require 2htdp/image)
(scale 2 (make-object bitmap% 10 10))
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
This was a contract error.

This probably would have been a type error in TS, but in a conventional ML type system it may have been an type error if option types were used and it may have been a runtime error if exceptions were used.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Wed, 02 Dec 2009 00:09:10 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released in SVN.

Thanks for the report!
