>Description:
The documentation for enable-evaluation in drscheme:unit:tab<%> seems wrong.

The documentation claims that both the enable-evalution and disable-evaluation methods disable GUI elements for starting evaluation. Also, it claims that both methods lock the interactions and definitions windows.

The documentation for disable-evaluation starts with "Call this method to disable evaluation GUI evaluation..."
