>Description:
If I have both "Follow lib requires" and "Follow PLaneT requires" unchecked there is a bunch of activity in looking up and indexing library modules when I start to view modules in the Module Browser. This seems unnecessary, because I do not wish to view information about this stuff. It seems that it would be better if it did not happen. It takes an appreciable amount of time, although not an enormous amount.
>How-To-Repeat:
Uncheck the two check boxes mentioned above. Hide the Module Browser. Open the Module Browser and watch all sorts of activity about library modules been logged at the bottom of the Dr. Racket window.
>Fix:
