>Description:
What the subject line says.  At least one way of switching windows in Windows 7 simply fails to list the Bug Report form at all, while the modal window is open.  It's restored to its place in the world when the modal window is closed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Initiate Bug Report.
Go to Language | Choose Language.
The Bug Report Form is no longer available for selection in the window switcher (Alt-Tab).  The switcher shows only ONE window, which is the DrRacket window with the modal language chooser.  However, you CAN get to the bug report form by going to the quick start bar at the bottom and hovering over the DrRacket icon (which shows two open windows).  In the hover-preview, these are the DrRacket window (sans modal window) and the Bug Report form.

 Does the same thing happen with the two windows created by the program belo=
 w?
 
 #lang racket/gui
 (define f (new frame% [label "Bug Report"] [width 200] [height 200]))
 (define d (new dialog% [label "Choose Language"] [width 200] [height 200]))
 (define b (new button% [label "Close"] [parent d] [callback (=CE=BB x (send
 d show #f))]))
 (send f show #t)
 (send d show #t)

 Yes!  In more detail, here's what I see:
 
 Two windows pop up, both on top of DrRacket, but Bug Report is not
 selected while Choose Language is selected.
 
 In the Alt-Tab switcher, there are two Racket windows, that of
 DrRacket and that of Choose Language.  I do not see a way of getting
 to Bug Report.
 
 Quick Start shows three, including Bug Report, and I can select it
 from there.
 
 But even after I've selected it, Alt-Tab still only shows Choose
 Language, ie, its status persists.
 
 Closing Choose Language is what gives me the REPL prompt.  This also
 restores Bug Report to the Alt-Tab switcher (so both DrRacket and Bug
 Report are in the queue).
