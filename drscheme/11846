>Description:
I've compiled DrRacket 5.1 on my Debian (testing) system and basically none of the [Ctrl]-key shortcuts work.  Also when in debug mode when I press the Step button I can not press it again unless I move the mouse off the button and then back on.  Are there shortcut keys to the debugger (not that they'd work on my current system, but in the future)?
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run DrRacket 5.1 on a Debian system. [Ctrl]-c/v/x/o/F6/etc. don't work.  But they do work with the DrScheme in the repos. But DrScheme has random freezes
