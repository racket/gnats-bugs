I'm putting this back out into the PR queue because MrEd 100/1
provides a means to solve the problem, but the problem won't go away
automatically and it's outside thre MrEdEngine domain.

In 100/1, double-clicking a file under MacOS calls the frontmost
top-level window's on-drop-file method (only if drag-and-drop is
enabled for the window using the accept-drop-files method). Thus, the
new splash screen will have to handle files double-clicked during
startup.

 No. Double-clicking an .ss file or dragging-to-DrScheme-icon under
 Windows starts a new DrScheme. But you can drag a file to an open
 DrScheme window (and even to a specific part of the DrScheme window,
 which is why on-drop-file is a window<%> method).
