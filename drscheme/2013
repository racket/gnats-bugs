>Organization:
titan
>Environment:
MS Windows NT
>Description:
When I used "Save Definitions As", sometimes DrScheme did not refreshing
the file name on the tool bar (the file name on the title is correct but
not the one on the tool bar.)  If I make the DrScheme window to refresh
(minimize, resize, etc.), the file name will get refresh.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open any file
2. Select File|Save Definition as
3. Save as a new file
4. The file name on the title bar will reflect the change but the file name
   on the tool bar will not.
