>Description:
If some text is already selected, and you type Alt-d, both the selected text AND the next word disappear.  I regard this as a bug (I have now been bitten by it several times).  I would have wanted the word to be deleted but the selected text to stay selected.  The Emacs behavior (delete next word, make its text the new content of the paste buffer, removing selection) would also be fine and may be even better due to familiarity.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put

  foo bar

in a buffer and select "foo".  Now hit Alt-d.  Both "foo" and "bar" disappear.
>Fix:
