>Description:
It would be nice if DrScheme had separate font settings for display and for printing. On my machine, the most appropriate font size for viewing on screen is 14pt (Andale Mono), but if I print at that size 80-character lines are wrapped; I need to decrease the size to 10pt for decent print results.

 Ok.
 
 Ryan: I will look into making editor printing under Mac OS X use an 80%
 scale. That scaling factor works well for PostScript output, and
 TextEdit seems to scale plain text by about the same amount.

I happy to report that 80 columns of 14-pt Andale Mono
fit at that scale. 

DrScheme (or the framework) should provide a "Page Setup"
menu item, in case you need to adjust the scale, so I'm leaving
the PR open for that (and shifting to Robby). Overall, I think
scaling is the right solution for the problem.
