>Description:
If you put an inline image in a 
semicolon comment, all the words 
following the image on that line 
are colored (and paren-matched) 
as if they were source code.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make an image snip, e.g. by
evaluating 
(rectangle 30 30 'solid 'blue)

2. Copy the image snip to the clipboard.

3. In the definitions window, type:

(define
; some comment text

4. Paste the image snip after "text" above

5. Type some more comment text.  Note 
that the coloring is wrong.  

6. Type a end paren character, and note
that it matches the open paren [[ before
define above]].

Reason>>> Yes, tihs is the same bug as the indentation one.
