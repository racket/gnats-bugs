>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create 2 tabs in Drscheme

2. Run Check Syntax in one of them on a bad program, so  that you
   get a panel with a syntax error.

3. Close the panel.

4. Switch tabs ad swiath back
    => the panel re-appears
>Fix:
Yet another problem with tab vs frame state. Now the tab remembers if its check syntax error message panel is supposed to be open, instead of it being implicit (and thus on the frame).
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation. Nor was it a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 05 Jul 2008 10:10:05 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.
