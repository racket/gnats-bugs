 This seems like a horrible mess to get involved in.
 
 Perhaps there is a better way to go about this than to get drracket involved.
 
 Can you say why you're editing a DOS-style file under ubuntu?

 I am collaborating with another author on a project; he works on
 Windows, and I on Ubuntu.  We both use git.  Whenever I change one of
 his files, I end up generating a huge diff just because of the
 newlines.  I suspect that the same thing will happen when he edits the
 files on his end.

 I think that he mis-configured his git.
 
 I do this all the time and what should happen is that he should have
 told git to do this conversion (server side: unix line-endings,
 client-side: dos line-endings) when he installed it. There is an
 option in the initial installation window thingy.

 This way of autoconverting newlines on checking-checkout does not have
 consensus.  For example:
 
     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2825428/why-should-i-use-core-autocrlf-true-in-git
 
 I've personally had small nightmares when trying to use autocrlf in
 the past, and I don't want to inflict that pain on my collaborator
 again.
 
 
 What happens when one is editing a file in DrRacket on Windows?  Does
 it save with the platform-specific "\r\n", or does it use "\n"?

 +3.
 
 To get a glimpse of the full extent of the mess, consider what happens
 if drracket sees a file with mixed newline formats.  Emacs resolves
 this carefully, by using LF newlines in that case, and making CRs be
 in the editor.  But there are non-trivial amounts of code around that
 issue.

 It's true that there are issues around this -- you run into the same
 issues with cygwin, where it can do the conversion for text files
 under some conditions.
 
 To avoid the problems that you see, I think that its best to just
 avoid any conversions (either in cygwin, git, or drracket), and just
 use LF line endings uniformly in all text files.  You lose the ability
 to edit files with Notepad, and you need to be careful when you use
 (MS) tools that will silently convert the text to CRLF.  (And I don't
 think that there are many of these left.)

 FWIW, Eli's proposal below seems like it would cause problems for
 people that upgrade from earlier versions of Racket. What to do about
 them?

 I wasn't suggesting any change in drracket.

 OK, I see the problem now (I almost never work on Windows, so I wasn't
 aware of this).  Looks like *DrRacket* is one of the tools that
 silently convert a file with LF newlines to CRLF.  I think that this
 is a huge mistake.  The main reason it's bad: it forces people on
 windows to use such conversion options in git, cygwin, and anything
 else that might be used to move files (rsync/unison syncing, local or
 remote FS mounts, etc).
 
 But I'm talking only about what happens on the windows side.  How
 about this:
 
 * if a file is using CRLF consistently, then changes will make it
   saved with CRLFs.
 
 * otherwise, it's opened with 'any line endings, and when it's saved
   it will use LF endings.
 
 This will work fine with existing files in any format, and will avoid
 the surprise of getting a file converted silently.  Files with mixed
 ending formats will get converted to LF-only, but those files are
 already broken.

 So, when DrRacket opens the file, it scans it and makes a decision
 about which of those two modes to use? I can go one better: if it uses
 the CRLF mode, then you get a little icon in the bottom right corner
 of the window saying that.
 
 Would that satisfy you Danny?

 Yeah, and use CRLF only if the input is consistently CRLF-ed.

 Just to be sure we're clear; I think that this would not help you
 unless your collaborator used the pre-release version of DrRacket (or
 waited for the next release).

 Actually, this *might* be a problem for people who (because of the
 current situation) already setup the git/cygwin/etc conversion, and
 will trip over newly made files -- so maybe a (potentially hidden)
 preference could determine the default.
 
 But I'm not sure that it's worth it, since I think that all "good"
 tools will just work with an LF file.  (Untested though, changing
 cygwin or tweaking git configuration is high-cost.)

 Oh I'm definitely adding a preferencethat will let people keep the current
 behavior. (the default will be the new behavior)
 
 There is no question that changing DrRacket in this way is perilous and I'll
 do my best to make this work well and hopefully minimize users' pain.
