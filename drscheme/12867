>Description:
A Debian user reports

In dialogues such as the language selector, drracket respects the GTK+
theme's background (I am using the HighContrastLargePrintInverse
theme) but not the text colour.  This results in black text on a dark
blue background.

drracket ought either to respect the theme completely or, if it is
going to assert its own foreground colour, assert its own background
colour as well.

For reference the Debian bug is

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=635995

Not much there at the moment.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set a theme like HighContrastInverse using e.g. gtk-chtheme

Open the "Choose language dialog"

Observe that it is mostly unreadable.
