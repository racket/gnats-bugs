>Description:
When reverting a file, things break when the file was binary
and is now text:

  insert-file in text%: not a MrEd editor<%> file

The same happens for the auto reverting when clicking "run".
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrScheme, edit a file and make sure it is saved
   in binary format.
2. Outside of DrScheme, make the file have text again.
3. "Revert" the file in DrScheme
>Fix:
Use 'guess instead of 'same for the call to load-file in the code that implements revert.
>Release-Note:
this is a contract violation.

 DrScheme passes 'same to load-file to do a revert. 
 
 Is that wrong? I guess, from this PR that it should be passing 'guess.
 But then, is 'same ever useful?

 Sounds like it would only be useful only for some "open-as-text"
 thing.

 That's what 'text is for, I believe. Not 'same. No?

 Oh right...  I was thinking along the lines of opening a file in some
 fixed mode, and then you can always save it in the same format -- but
 if you had some option to do this, it would be easy to just put the
 mode symbol somewhere and use that...
 
 (So, I'm on your side of the question now, except that I don't know
 much about these parts...)

 Yes, I think 'guess is the right thing.

 It seems less useful for loading than saving, certainly. I'm not sure
 whether it's useful or useless.
