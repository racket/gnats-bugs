If I open a file (and have program contour opened)
and I click on the Program-Contour window DrScheme Crashes/hangs.
I copied this message from the error window but I cannot copy & paste as the windows are frozen:

" quotient expects type <integer> as 1st argument given: -209.5; other arguments were:2
... "
>How-To-Repeat:
Set Program Contour on.
Open a relatively long scheme file.
Click with the mouse on the Program Contour Window
You should see the crash.

 I believe this bug has been fixed since the release. You might want to  
 try a more recent pre-release version of DrScheme if this is important  
 to you.
