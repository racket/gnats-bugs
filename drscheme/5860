>Description:
As in summary, (may not be new, but though it was fixed)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try it, the real problem is that if the front window is brough forward,
it obscures the preferences window, and end up having to move widows around manually to get to it.

(double cliking on the title bar, in addion to hitting the minimze
button, to minimize the window to the doc would be nice too if
possible)

>Fix:
the bug is that the framework wasn't creating a framework
frame for the preferences; it was creating a regular
mred frame. This isn't a contract violation -- those
frames are allowed, but this shouldn't have been one of them.
