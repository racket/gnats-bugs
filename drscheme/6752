>Description:
Hi, I've got a program which contains code from several modules I'd like to profile. 
I can set profiling enabled on in my language settings and then run the test driver 
program, but the colored contours only appear in the test driver file (and not the
modules where all of the real code is). Is there a technique to view the profiling 
information in multiple modules/files? Thanks -- ethan.aubin@pobox.com

 There isn't currently a way to see the colors in other window, I don't
 think. You should see the relative times of functions in other windows
 tho, right?

 A similar but reverse problem exists when an error occurs within an
 externally required module definition file: as the back-trace only shows
 the invocation chain local to that terminal external file, but not other
 intervening module code files, and/or local definition window code which
 execution had threaded through prior to invoking the code expressing the
 error; often resulting in little if any indication of the true originating
 potential locations of the error, which can be rather frustrating.

 Are you sure you're not making tail recursive calls?
