>Description:
When double-clicking on a .rkt file in the Mac Finder, with DrRacket not running, the application launches but just opens a new blank document instead of the file that was double-clicked on. 

I also tried in the terminal:
$ open file.rkt
and it behaves the same way -- launches DrRacket but doesn't open the file.

However,
$ drracket file.rkt

does work correctly -- it launches the application and displays file.rkt

 FWIW, this has long been happening to me, but I've also found that it
 tends to work on the second or third try (using 'open') and then it
 works thereafter until I restart drracket.
 
 Not great news, I know, but at least kind-of work around.
