>Description:
When the user supplies more than one S-expression for
a `read', and `read' is interleaved with `display', then
the I/O box gets confused. (It works fine in 103.)

(I think the bug is more general, but this is how I managed
to pin down something small.)

>How-To-Repeat:
Execute this expression:
  (begin (read) (printf "1~n") (read) (printf "2~n"))
In the I/O box, type `a', then Return, then `b', then Return,
and it's fine.

Evaluate the same expression, but type `a b' then Return. The
output `1' is missing, and the box seems to be waiting for
another Return (after which no `2' appears).

    I didn't find a general problem, just 2 small ones.
    the basic io infrastructure didn't have to change.
    
    FWIW, I think that 103 puts the output in the wrong
    place, but this version doesn't do that.
