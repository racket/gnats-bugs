>Description:
In Dr. Scheme (in eiether HtDP or ProfessorJ mode), if one clicks from the main body of definitions text and into an interactions box, comment box, etc.  the cursor coordinates shown in the status bar simply freeze at their last postition and do not reflect the cursor's movements in the box. From investigation, it appears that such a box, though it may contain multiple lines, only exists on a single line in the definitions text. If would be nice if the cursor coordinates at least reflected the line on which the box resided.

Perhaps even better (though I do not know if such a thing would be possible) would be if, instead of existing as one line entities, these boxes merely enclosed areas of definitions text space. That is, the text inside the boxes would have coordinates consistent with the text outside.
