>Description:
There's a contract violation where text:get-completions/manuals is being called with #f, but where it only allows lists.  The fix seems to be to pass in the empty list instead.  Here a patch to address the problem:

>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The bug was that the call site changed in the right way, but the contract wasn't updated (nor was the implementation ...). I had gotten pulled away from this and then had forgotten to return to it.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation. This probably would have been a  type error, and a useful one at that.

Reason>>> 
fixed and released to SVN.

The call was actually right -- it was the contract and the
implementation of the function that were wrong. (I had
started changing this, but had gotten pulled away and forgot
to return to it. Oops!)
