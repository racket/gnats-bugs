>Description:
I have key bindings disabled so I can use Emacs keystrokes.  This works almost fine.  For some strange reason, however, Alt-c is still bound.  So if I'm trying to convert comments into types and need to capitalize, I type Alt-c but, instead of getting the capitalized word I get a menu instead.  Alt-c should capitalize the same way that Alt-f moves forward rather than pull down the File menu.

 Just to double check, do you see an underlined "c" anywhere in your menubar=
 ?

 Yep, when I hit Alt-c, not until then.
