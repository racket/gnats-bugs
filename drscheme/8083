>Description:
Put the following program into DrScheme and click Check Syntax:

(module bug mzscheme
  (require (lib "unitsig.ss"))
  (define-signature bug^ (oops))
  (define bug@
    (unit/sig bug^
      (import)
      (define oops #f)))
  (define-values/invoke-unit/sig bug^ bug@ #f)
  oops)

Then right-click on the last occurence of `oops'. Every time I do this I get a DrScheme internal error message popup with the following error report:

send: no such method: get-frame for class: definitions-canvas%

 === context ===
/var/tmp/trunk/collects/mzlib/private/class-internal.ss:3124:2: obj-error
/var/tmp/trunk/collects/drscheme/private/unit.ss:604:9

(By the way, ignore PR 8082 -- it turns out it wasn't non-repeatable, I was just misremembering what I had clicked to cause the error. Once I've submitted this PR I'll mark that one as a dup of this one.)
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
>Fix:
the wrong method was being called. now it calls the right one.
>Release-Note:
this was a contract violation (with a nice stacktrace and everything!)
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Fri, 02 Jun 2006 11:07:20 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN
