>Description:
Kept getting the following popup dialog when starting DrScheme on Windows XP. Couldn't find any TMPPREFxxx file in the folder mentioned but where were 2 saved .toc files. Deleting those seemed to clear it. No other DrScheme process was running that I could see.

Error saving preferences: rename-file-or-directory: cannot rename file or directory: C:\Documents and Settings\riesbeck\Application Data\PLT Scheme\TMPPREF1262897963177578964 to: C:\Documents and Settings\riesbeck\Application Data\PLT Scheme\plt-prefs.ss (Access is denied.; errno=5)
>How-To-Repeat:
Not clear what caused it. The previous exit from DrScheme was normal.
>Fix:
