>Description:
Under MacOSX, choosing Scheme > Create Executable... threw me for
a loop for a few minutes.  The dialogue to decide where to save my
impending file didn't let me specify a name, and I could only
select folders (not even existing files).  Yeah yeah,
after a while I remember that MacOSX applications always come
packed within a folder; this may not be known by casual OSX users
though.

Even after remembering that, I create a folder, and get a dialogue
"sorry, the file chosen must end in '.app'" (adding another
dollop of annoyance).  (Everything worked after I did this though.)


As to a solution -- 
A cheap stop-gap would be to add a note to the dialogue
reminding "choose (or create) a folder whose name ends in .app".

Though I'm guessing there probably is already some flag/call
within the OSX gui, because the "Open file" dialog (as used
in DrScheme already) doesn't let me descend into a
application-folder, and instead treats it as an atomic file.


Cheers,
ian

ps John, if this bug report gets routed to you, "hi!".  Or for
whomoever this gets to, I guess.
