State-Changed-Why:

I could not reproduce this bug (probably went away in a release along the
way). If you are still seeing this problem, please let me know, preferably
with more detail (language level and teachpacks at a minimum).

To reproduce, create a launcher in the mred language level with the
program:

  (require-library "file.ss")
