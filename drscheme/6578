>Description:
The Interactions history (i.e. that which is accessed by pressing ESC-p) is the same for all open Dr. Scheme windows. Thus, if one types (+ 1 1) in the Interactions window of File1.ss and then types (list 1 2 3) in the Interactions window of File2.ss, pressing ESC-p in the Interactions window of File1.ss will result in (list 1 2 3) instead of (+ 1 1). If enough statements are executed in the Interactions window of File2.ss, the history of the Interactions window of File1.ss becomes inaccessible.

This seems wrong and it would be nice if there were at least an option to keep individual Interactions histories for each open window.

This also exists in 205.5-csv2003oct30.
