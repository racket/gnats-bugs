>Description:
Background:
My student machines are on Windows XP with service pack 2. They have the Centurion Lock on them. (The students can mess with the C drive all they want and on restart everything is lost there and the C drive is as fresh as the day it was created.) My students have names and passwords to get to their partition on the local machines. DrScheme, version 208p1, is on the machines.

Current Situation:
Every once in a while (and when they save their files) Dr. Scheme wants to do an action and can't. It gives the following error:

call-with-output-file: cannot open output file: "C:\PLT-autosave-toc" (Access is denied.; errno=5)

My students hit the right buttons and continue working. The files are saved. 

I tried doing a search for C:\PLT-autosave-toc and had no luck.



Thanks
