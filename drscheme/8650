>Description:
I've nearly completed my blog post on the topic of making a User Defined Keybindings Module.  One of the problems I encountered in writing the article was in reproducing the default set of Active Key Bindings, because those that you can easily display, you cannot simply copy off the listbox to use in generating an html table.

I ended up writing a program that uses scheme:setup-keymap to populate a brand new keymap:aug-keymap% object with keybindings. Then I add keymap:setup-global, keymap:setup-search, keymap:setup-file and finally chain in a keymap made from drscheme:rep:get-drs-bindings-keymap.  This about matches the Active Keybindings listbox, however, it looks like the code to get to the menu bindings is located in a private function in frame.scm.

It would be a great benefit to be able to just copy the Active Keybindings off the display.  However, in some cases, I'm noticing that the function name is actually just a descriptive text of what a key sequence is bound to.  So, while being able to copy the keybinding directly off the Active Keybindings listbox is a step in the right direction, it won't solve the whole problem of tracking down the names of the functions to call.

Below, I've included the code I used to reproduce the keybindings in an html table format.  I'd really like to produce a definitive article on constructing User Defined Keybinding modules, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated, especially if I've missed some function in one of the manuals that would give me access to the menu shortcut keybindings.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [plt-bug] all/8650: Would like to be able to copy keybindings off Active Keybindings ListBox
Date: Wed, 9 May 2007 09:36:47 -0500

 Some of the things in the active keybindings are the names of menu
 items, so there is no function directly assocated with those (well,
 you can get a hold of the menu item as an object in Scheme and then
 call its callback function, I suppose).
 
 Probably the best thing, rather than making that something you can
 copy and paste, is to get the answer as an sexpression so you feed it
 directly into your script.
 
 So, the easiest way to do that is to insert this line:
 
   ((dynamic-require '(lib "pretty.ss") 'pretty-print) structured-list)
 
 into the definition of show-keybindings (in the body of the let), in
 the file plt/collects/drscheme/private/frame.ss.
 
 Then, do this:
 
   setup-plt -l drscheme
 
 start up drscheme, select the keybindings, and you should see all of
 the output. If you use windows, you'll probably want to redirect that
 to a file, something like this:
 
 (call-with-output-file "whatever.ss"
   (lambda (port)
     ((dynamic-require '(lib "pretty.ss") 'pretty-print) structured-list port))
   'truncate)
 
 but under macos and unix, you should be able to just copy the output
 into a file.
 
 Sorry for the delayed response! (In general, you may find more timely
 help on the plt-scheme mailing list. Everyone who gets bug reports
 also reads that list, plus many helpful others.)
 
 hth,
 Robby

 The patch worked like a charm.  Unfortunately, I had posted my article late Tuesday night.  I'm not sure it misses much, though, because I direct people to the PLT list for information regarding any function calls to shortcuts bound to menu items.  And, since, as you say, there aren't any named functions, per say, for some of the shortcuts, I think  I gave people a good deal to work with in the way of setting up custom User Defined Keybindings.  Besides which, if I'd been able to copy the list right off the screen to begin with, I would never have done so much fun tracking down where they all come from.
 
 If you get a chance, take a look at the article at schemekeys.blogspot.com.  I want to thank very much for putting up with my persistent quest for answers.  You provided everything I needed to make the article possibe.  Hopefully, newcommers will have an easier time understanding the keybinding process, if they get a chance to read the article.  And if not, I'd still have written it.  I have a passion for teaching, and my webblog gives me a virtual classroom to express myself.  Now if I could only teach my one year old son what the word `no' means the first time I say it.
 
 Thanks a bunch,

 Very nice article! Thanks for spending the time to write it!

 Looks like I'm about 6 months behind you on that one ... our son
 doesn't get "no" on the Nth time, yet :)
