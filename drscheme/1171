>Description:
Pinned arrows are not automatically moved when the font size changes. However, when the user moves the mouse over the proper identifier, the pinned arrow is redrawn in the proper location.  Can't these arrows be invalidated automatically by a font size change?

State-Changed-Why:

I'm planning to redefine the `on-change' method to be what we want
here.

`on-change' currently doesn't do anything useful, as one might suspect
from the essentially non-existent documentation. The one place where
`on-change' is used in ~scheme/plt/collects is already covered (more
accurately) by overriding `set-modified'.

The new `on-change' will be called whenever any change occurs to an
editor that affects the way it is drawn or the values reported for the
location/size of any snip. The `on-change' method will be called just
before the editor calls its administrator's `needs-update' method to
refresh the editor's display. The editor will be locked for writing
and reflowing during the call to `on-change'.

Sound ok?
