>Description:
When there's an error, there is the single stopsign icon which (IIUC) takes
you to the location of the error.  I think that it would be way better to
get rid of this icon, and have the text be clickable and do the same.

The reason I don't like having this icon is that it is very confusing to
see it next to the multiple-stopsigns icon.  The visual difference between
them is (at least in my view) not giving me any clue about what they do, so
I end up trying both.

I can see a minor hint of a clue in that the stacktrace has several
locations in its path, but that's weak enough to not be memorable.

 Matthew: now that the editor stuff is in Scheme, would you consider
 adding support to clickbacks so that they apply some style delta to
 the clickback range when the mouse passes over the them (without
 clicking)? That would make the below relatively painless and still
 make me feel comfortable with people figuring out that the error
 message text is clickable.
 
 (I'd make an underline appear under the message when the mouse passed
 over it, I expect. Unless either of you have better ideas?)
