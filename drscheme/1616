>Description:
write program like this

(define (foo x)
  ;; now stuff happens
  (set-node-moo! x 10))

Then wrap a let expression around the body and the comment: 

(define (foo x)
  (let ([glob 10])
  ;; now stuff happens
  (set-node-moo! x glob)))

Now re-indent and watch the comment stay where it is. 
[Go to line with ;; and hit TAB. The line won't move.]

 Perhaps I misunderstood, but you asked for this behavior a while 
 back. See PR 1437.
 
 The choices you have are the behavior you get with 1 semi colon and 
 the behavior you get with 2 semi colons. I change the number of semi 
 colons that go with each behavior, but that's it.

 In that pr you said that this is a problem of the paren matcher and that 
 
  It turns out that the tabber does not indent lines that begin with 
  three semi-colons. I have changed this to lines with 2 semicolons for 
  the next release.
  
 I don't understand the connection but so be it.

 Perhaps I can explain it when you get in.
