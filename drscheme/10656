>Description:
It would be nice it when the interactions window was hidden, it did not appear when Run is hit unless there was some output to display.  For example, when I use DrScheme to develop Slideshow talks, I usually don't use the REPL, and having it there takes away screen real-estate.  When I hide it, I wish it would stay hidden.

 How about instead a preference that controls if the interactions
 window becomes visible when clicking "Run"? (Waiting until the first
 output before showing it would, I think, be a big change in the way
 drscheme feels; right now you get this big honking feedback when you
 click "Run" and I'm a little bit nervous to make that go away all the
 time.)

 In general, I'm not a fan of adding additional preferences, even for
 things I want.  In this particular case, I would still want it to
 appear when there is output.  So if I understand this idea, I'm not
 sure I'd use the preference.
 
 Now that I think about it, I might have been imagining a magic version
 of this where it would know in advance whether there would be output
 in the future.  Given the impossibility of that, I'm not sure if what
 I'm suggesting would be an improvement.
