>Description:
Using the "Open Recent>" menu item to open a file that has been deleted opens a new
(blank) window, with the path popup set to the full path, rather than a popup list of
directories.  It looks like DrScheme thinks the name of the file includes all the "/"'s.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrScheme.  Create a file. Save it.  Quit DrScheme. Delete the file.  Start
up DrScheme.  Go to the "Open Recent>" Menu, and select the file you just created.

(It may not be necessary to quit DrScheme.)
