>Description:
Check Syntax offers two rather than one renaming 
option for an identifier, and choosing the wrong one
results in not all instances being renamed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following program:

(define (f n)
  (* n n))

(f 10)

Now Check Syntax, and mouse over the F defined.  You get
an arrow to the use (f 10).
Right click.  The pop-up has TWO, undifferentiated entries
  Rename f
(If they're intended to do different things, they should
at least have entries that read differently.)

Choosing the second consistently renames both Fs.
Choosing the first renames only the binding instance,
not the bound one (the use of F).

I tried a few different things (like recursive uses)
and couldn't find a case where the first rename entry
renames anything but the binding instance.

This is not a problem at the bound instance.
>Fix:
the bug was somehow due to the `provide' declarations that
htdp-lang.ss inserts into the implicitly created module (when
clicking execute, drscheme makes up a module to go around
the contents of the definitions window).

Before module->namespace, this module had to explicitly provide
all of the defined names in the toplevel. No longer. So, I just got
rid of that code. I'm not exactly sure *why* it was broken.

 This bug was just fixed. Please double check you have the latest version.

 I have the latest build from a few hours ago.  The core binaries
 appear to have been built at 1:53am.

 I'm not sure what happened. Matthew fixed this (a bug in the expansion
 of define in the beginner level) the other day. Yet, I'm seeing it back
 again in the latest CVS code, too.
 
 Matthew?

 The teaching-language change is still in place (still passes the new
 test, which failed before).
 
 I don't recall checking the effect in DrScheme, though. I certainly see
 the bug in DrScheme currently.
 
 One possibility is that my test/repair doesn't actually address the
 problem. Can you check in whatever way you checked before?

 The teaching languages are now implicitly in a module and that module
 has (had, before fixing this bug) a provide declaration with the
 identifier in each top-level define-values and define-syntaxes.
 Removing those made this problem go away. I'm not entirely sure why
 that is, however (it needed to go away, regardless. That was from the
 pre-module->namespace days).
 
 This is quite strange. I double checked this twice just to be sure.
 Anways, new code out shortly, when the test suite finishes.
