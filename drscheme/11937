>Description:
When I click on File > Save Definitions As... no racket files appear on the dialog. I expected to see other existing ".rkt" files on the current directory.
(Ubuntu 10.10, Racket 5.1.1 from source)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create and save a file, name it "program1.rkt" on /home/user/racket/programs/. Create another file, click on the menu File > Save Definitions. Noticed that even though the current directory is /home/user/racket/programs/, it seems to be empty.
