>Description:
When there's stuff at the end of the XML element
in an XML box, the reader gives an awkward error with
no source information:

  read-xml: extra stuff at end of document #<struct:wrapped>
>How-To-Repeat:
In a fresh document, create an XML box.  In it, type
<head>.  At this point it inserts the closing tag.  Now
go past the closing tag and insert another XML box.
Click on Execute.

State-Changed-Why:
    added source locations.
    
    technically, this pr was a feature requrest, I guess. 
    I added information to the XML reader's exns that
    shows where the source locations are and drscheme
    now pays attention to that.
    
    Its not clear that there should be any contract in there.
