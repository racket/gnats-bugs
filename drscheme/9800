>Description:
When the horizontal scrollbar shows up in the program contour, it does not go away until you either:
1.) Hide and Show the program contour again (an annoyance), or 
2.) Delete all of the contents of the buffer

Why I care about making the horizontal scrollbar go away: I was planning to tell students that they could use the presence of the horizontal scrollbar in the contour as a sign that their lines are too long.  But this guidance is not reasonable if the horizontal scrollbar does not go away if the long lines go away.

(Another solution that would make me happy: have DrScheme optionally provide some more obvious negative feedback to the user on programs with overly large lines.)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Make a new program
2. Show program contour (Cmd-U on Mac)
3. Make a newline (so program is non empty)
3. Make another line that's so long it causes the horiztonal scrollbar to come up in the contour 
   (I use Insert Large Letters and put in a line that's 129 characters wide on my machine; YMMV...).
4. Delete the long line, but leave the first empty line.
   Note that the scrollbar is still in the contour.

 The scrollbar part of this is something I can't fix, right?
