Reason>>> I'm going to assume that the indenting actually works for you, since you 
didn't say anything about that.

Anyways, you're seeing the new preferences for indenting. The regexp takes
care of all of the defines.

 Thanks, hadn't considered that reg-exp ^def removed the necessity to list
 them explicitly, sorry. (Out of curiosity, is there any simple way to
 exclude similarly named functions, like (default ...) for example, or would
 I need likely then need to list the define-like-functions explicitly, or
 exclude it explicitly in the reg-exp?)

 There's no way currently, but Eli thinks that the indenting interface
 is too simple still so you may see more from him later on.

 Yes, I think that the indentation thing (and the preferences) need
 some reworking.  I think that the regexp approach is generally better
 since you get more benefits from many define-like keywords than the
 occasional damage for some `default-foo' function, but that can
 probably be fixed too (probably by adding a rule for "^default" after
 the "^def").

 I just moved it to you so you can close it.  When I do my things
 later, it will be unrelated to this bug, so there's no point in
 holding it open.
 
 I'll close it now.

 Ah.
 
 Thanks. Sorry for the confusion.
