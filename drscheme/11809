>Description:
As an option in the preferences, DrRacket could remember all open files and the editor states (scrollposition, etc.) when the application is quit, and open these files and restore the states automatically when it is relaunched.

Many advanced development environments do this and it is very handy for people working on the same project for a longer period.

 There may be a package on planet that does this: did you check on the
 mailing list?
