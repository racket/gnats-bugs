>Description:
The display of nested quoted forms in DrRacket doesn't agree with the documentation example.

The Racket Guide section 4.10 says at the bottom of the page:
---------------
An expression 'datum is a shorthand for (quote datum)
and this shorthand is almost always used instead of quote. The shorthand applies even within the datum, so it can produce a list containing quote.

Examples:
...
...
> (display '(you can 'me))
(you can (quote me))
---------------------------

But when I type the example in DrRacket 
> (display '(you can 'me))  
it prints out in the evaluation pane:
(you can 'me) NOT (you can (quote me))

It prints correctly when I display to an output string.

 I think the issue is the configuration of the printer when rendering
 the documentation.
 
 No?

 No, this is a difference in behavior between DrRacket and the
 command-line Racket, so I think the docs for something need to be
 clarified (unless one of those behaviors should change).

 Matthew, in racket we get this:
 
 [robby@yanpu] ~$ racket
 Welcome to Racket v5.2.1.3.
 > (display '(you can 'me))
 (you can (quote me))> ^D
 
 but in DrRacket, we get this (with "#lang racket" in the definitions window):
 
 Welcome to DrRacket, version 5.2.1.3--2012-01-17(71595a5/g) [3m].
 Language: racket; memory limit: 128 MB.
 > (display '(you can 'me))
 (you can 'me)
 >
 
 (the difference being (quote me) vs 'me)
 
 Are these both right? If so, what's the rationale (as that rationale
 would probably need to get folded in the docs at the point where this
 example appears).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Offhand, the DrRacket output doesn't look right to me, and I'd say that
 `pretty-display' is to blame.

 Yes, that makes sense to me. The docs say that pretty-display should
 print like display does, but:
 
 [robby@yanpu] ~/git/plt/collects/drracket$ racket
 Welcome to Racket v5.2.1.3.
 > (display ''hi)
 (quote hi)> (pretty-display ''hi)
 'hi
 > ^D
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
