DrScheme Jr does not.

(N.B.: dxpc actually makes DrScheme load and redraw over a modem line
in reasonable time!)

 That's because pi is a part of the turtles package, believe it or not. We
 will fix this kind of thing with unit/lang and drscheme II. DrScheme 100
 will be the first good step there. In DrS 100, the mred and mzscheme
 language level will be cleaned up (since we have a well-documented language 
 standard for them)
