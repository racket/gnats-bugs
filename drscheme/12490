>Environment:
linux-ubuntu
>Description:
When reading text using read-char and peek-char in DrRacket, peek-char will return #<eof> as soon as the 'eof' button is clicked. Any remaining characters on the current line of input will be discarded. Lines input before the current line of input are read completely.
>How-To-Repeat:
Consider the following function:

(define (in) (if (eof-object? (peek-char)) empty (cons (read-char) (in))))

When run in DrRacket, a graphical input box is presented. When the 'eof' button is pressed, the list which results from the evaluation of 'in' will contain all characters on all lines before the current line, but will not contain the characters on the current line of input for which 'eof' was pressed.

In the command line interpreter, the resulting list will contain all characters on all lines of the input.
