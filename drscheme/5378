>Description:
The program given below works OK when run from the source file saved on the C: drive, but generates an unusual error message when running from the source file saved on the A: drive (the floppy is not full, either).
I reported this error last December (running on Vers.103), received an almost immediate follow-up message and then heard nothing. I just installed Vers. 103p1 and tried again - the problem is still there.

 I believe this problem is fixed in the alpha version of DrScheme v200,
 available at
 
 	http://download.plt-scheme.org/
 
 Version 103p1 was released before your bug report in December.
 
 The actual v200 release should be available within the next several
 weeks.
