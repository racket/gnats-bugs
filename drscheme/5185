>Description:
If you enter an invalid fraction in the
"Insert fraction" dialog, you get an 
error message.  But the dialog no longer

is disabled.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter an invalid fraction such as 4 3/3.

    the parent of the error message is now the
    fraction dialog, not the original frame,
    so the fraction dialog doesn't get lost
    anymore.
