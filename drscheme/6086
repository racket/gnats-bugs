 This appears to be a windows-specific problem -- could normal 
 normal-case-path be doing this (I see that it doesn't change the 
 filename under mac os x).

 Yes, `normal-case-path' would put the name in lowercase under Windows.
 
 (All uses of `normal-case-path' should be removed, anyway.)

 I know that it's broken, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a job
 that it must do!
 
 DrScheme needs to be able to tell if two filenames refer to the same
 file or not.

 It's not possible in Windows without opening the files.
 
 I'll provide an operation for comparing file input ports in the near
 future --- v203.2 if you need it right away.

 I don't need it right away, but I would like to have it before I try to
 remove all uses of normal-case-path (since that's what I'll be
 replacing them with).
 
 Do you think that it's wothwhile to build a "refers to the same file
 predicate" into mzscheme that, under windows, opened the file and under
 other OSs maybe didn't? It could raise an exception under windows if
 the files couldn't be opened or something like that.

 I guess I haven't been clear, maybe because it took me a while to
 really understand all of the implications.
 
 Here's the bottom line:
 
  There's no such thing as a "refers to the same file" predicate on path
  names.
 
 Doesn't matter how you try to implement it. It's possible to find out
 what a name N1 means at time T1, but that says nothing about N1's
 meaning one microsecond later, because another process might have
 changed the mapping of pathnames.
 
 Open files have an identity. Even if you remap names, an open file
 remains the same open file (whose name might have changed, or even
 disappeared entirely). That's the only guarantee you get, though.
 
 Beyond that is the realm of heuristics. Identity of files through
 temporarily open ports is probably a useful heuristic for DrScheme. If
 DrScheme can't open a file, probably its heursitic for pathname
 identity is irrelevant, anyway.

 That's the same for file-exists? and even for (= 2 (car x)); I still
 care to check, at this point in time, if they refer the same file or
 not.

 Taken to an extreme, this means that buffers in emacs and files in
 DrScheme shouldn't have filenames associated with them at all, but
 clearly that is a useful association. I don't need any more guarantees
 beyond the ones that make that association work (however well it
 works).
 
 Or, perhaps file handles should remain open when DrScheme is editing
 the file? But that seems to open a whole new can of worms that would
 probably be much less tasty than the current ones.
 
 If the most sensible implementation of the same-file-name? function on
 all platforms is opening the file twice and checking this predicate of
 the ports, just provide that operation and I'll be fine. I inferred
 from your message that Windows made the situation worse and that we
 might want to implement a same-file-name? function in terms of some
 other filesystem primitives on other platforms, which is why I
 suggested it belonged inside mzscheme. That way future ports of
 mzscheme provide the right implementation of the predicate.
 
 Are you planning to eliminate normalize-path from mzlib too?

 I mean to write (in the last para)
 
   Are you planning to eliminate normalize-path from mzlib's file.ss
   too? If not, what purpose do you see it serving?

 As I said, heuristics can be useful. But there's a limit for how much
 effort we put into them. If `file-exists?' couldn't be implemented in
 Windows without opening the file, I doubt very much that MzScheme would
 provide it. That's why I'm arguing against a `same-file-name?'
 predicate in MzScheme.

 If we world we talk to didn't essentially force filenames on us, I'd be
 completely in favor of eliminating that mutable indirection.

 That's not an unreasonable approach. Many programs have taken this
 route in the past, especially in Windows and Mac OS.
 
 As you say, it's not clear that it's worthwhile. The user perhaps
 expects to adjust the pathname mapping with `mv', `rm', etc.

 I think that would be a useful MzLib "file.ss" function.
 
 > Are you planning to eliminate normalize-path from mzlib too?
 
 That function is also of questionable values, but I think heuristically
 useful.
 
 In contrast, making `normal-case-path' work well enough to be useful
 would require considerable effort.
