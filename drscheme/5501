If you use the File | Open URL dialog from
DrScheme, you get an error if the filename
contains a space.

Message:
Bad URL: normalize-path: "E:\\Documents and Settings" (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist

I can open the file in Mozilla, which seems
to insert %20's for the spaces
>How-To-Repeat:
File|Open URL
Browse
pick a file with a space in the directory path

 Interesting.  I was doing this as recently as two days ago.  Indeed,
 when I opened File | Open URL ..., the last file path there had spaces 
 in it, and it had worked fine before.  Could something have changed in 
 the recent past?
 
 I'll assume the problem is elsewhere unless someone can lay the blame
 at the URL collection's doorstep, because that code hasn't changed.
