MS Windows 95
>Description:
In this file, signature highlighting does not seem to work for the 
body-forms in this unit.  Whether this is a bug or not is up to you, but 
at the very least, consider it an RFI.

Unfortunately, it was very hard to browse your database to see if similar bugs 
were already reported.  Although you provided usage flags, it was difficult for
me to obtain the *texts* of these bug reports.  Therefore, I will submit this 
although I am aware it might be a duplication of a past bug.

;; here are the basic functions from Seasoned Schemer, that we
;; would like to have ready when we load Dr. Scheme.  I have
;; no idea if I'm doing this right.  I picked up what I could from
;; the examples in your documentation.

(define-signature seasoned^ (one? zero? add1 sub1 pick member?))
(unit/sig seasoned^
    (import)
    (define (one? n)
      (= n 1))
    
    (define (zero? n)
      (= n 0))
    
    (define (add1 n)
      (+ n 1))
    
    (define (sub1 n)
      (- n 1))
    
    (define (atom? n)
      (and (not (null? n))
	   (not (pair? n))))
    
    (define (pick n l)
      (cond ((null? l) '())
	    ((one? n) (car l))
	    (else
	     (pick (sub1 n) (cdr l)))))
    
    (define (member? a lat)
      (letrec ((iter (lambda (l)
		       (cond ((null? l) #f)
			     ((eq? (car l) a) #t)
			     (else
			      (iter (cdr l)))))))
	(iter lat))))

 Use the "-F" flag to query-pr to get the full texts. There is also a
 pointer to the flags on query pr from the bug report page.

 This will be fixed in a later release (maybe not the next one, but probably
 the one after).
