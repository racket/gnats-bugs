>Description:
As the subject says.

For example, I start composing a bug, close the window (ugh, as previous report),
start a new one and change the name or the email, and when the first is restored
later on it'll get the new name or email.  The name/email is not too bad, but this
will also happen for the synthesized information, which means that I can start
writing a bug, update the installation, and then the result is a bug with
information from the new setup about the old setup.

Now, I do think that it's an overkill to save all that stuff -- so perhaps some
note somewhere indicating that the current values are used?  Maybe save some
checksum of the synthesized information and show the warning once whenever a bug
is restored with a different setup?  Something like "the synthesized information
for bug reports has change, possibly due to a change in your setup, restored
reports will have the new information" -- except that this is not too great since
it can also change when the language is changed (and it seems complex to decide
when to show that -- doing the right thing will probably require keeping the
checksum for every report).

 (I see that an entry is created right after a bug report is opened,
 with an action to bring up that window -- it's a nice feature, but it
 makes the above a little more complicated, since in that case no
 warnings should be made...)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 20 Jan 2011 18:13:48 -0500
Reason>>> 

I thought about this for a little while and the only thing
that really seems to make sense is to actually save all of
this information, but that is kind of a pain and so I think
I'll just close the PR and consider this to be a "feature"
(unless someone else comes along and gets bitten too, I guess)
