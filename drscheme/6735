>Description:
Since today (March, 2nd, 2003) DrScheme has a new strange behavior during starting up: Instead of showing the usual the blue and circle with the lambda-Symbol inside the small modal window in the center of the screen, there is a blak and white start with 5 edges and underneath the letters P.L.T. (including the colons).
After starting up DrScheme is working well as before of today.
I found this new behavior at all the Mac OS X computers of our school's lab,  including my own PowerMac G3 b/w at home.
If You give me an e-mail-adress, I can send You a screen-shot of this new image as an attachment.
Has the day of March 2nd, a special meaning for PLT ? Or what is wrong?

Please, give us an answer.
Sincerely,

Gernot A. Lorenz, teacher for computer science and lab-admin

 Well, I think you can guess from the shape of the symbol that it's not
 completely random!
 
 That is the Texas PLT logo.  (PLT is the team that builds DrScheme.)
