>Description:
If DrRacket is open, it impedes a shutdown on OSX.  A dialog appears saying:

"The application DrRacket canceled restart.

To try again, quit DrRacket and choose Restart from the Apple menu."

I believe that the second attempt at restart works, indicating that despite the apparent lack of cooperation, DrRacket indeed terminates.

This is a small annoyance, in no way a critical bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
From a fresh login, start DrRacket.  Without making edits requiring a Save action, choose Restart from the menu launched from the Apple icon in the top left corner.
>Fix:
