>Description:
I am trying to view the module hierarchy for a module
written in #lang scheme. DrScheme responds with this 
error: 

 The module browser is only available for programs in 
 the PLT languages and in the module language (and
 only for programs that have modules in them).
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is how I have succeeded in reproducing this behavior three 
times: 

1. drscheme simple.ss & (simple.ss is a Beginner program)
2. cd ~/svn/Universe
3. open *.ss 
4. open world.ss 
5. use View an go to module browser. See error message. 
6. click run to make sure that the yellow status line goes away. 
7. use View an go to module browser. See error message. 

I will get you write-access to svn/Universe as soon as Eli is
awake.

(see audit trait)

This was not a contract violation. It also would not have been a type error.

 Eli, I have added Robby (and Matthew) to my svn directory
 
   Universe/
 
 and Robby needs access to this directory to reproduce the
 bug.
 
 Robby, I just checked that
 
 $ cd Universe/
 $ drscheme world.ss
 
 exhibits the same problem as the steps suggested below
 (if drscheme starts with a non-module languages for
 sure. Indeed, I haven't been able to bring up the browser
 at all.)

 Thanks. The missing step for me from your earlier reports was that the
 language had to be explicitly set to the teaching languages (which
 sets your preferences) before opening the module-language file (which
 changes the language without setting the preferences).
 
 The bug was the module language was checking the preference setting
 instead of the window's language setting. (The bug had been there
 since at least August of 2007 and probably earlier.)

 I had seen it before but it went away soon enough for me to think I  
 had imagined it.

 Yes, I can easily see that happening ...
