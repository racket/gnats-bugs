>Description:
Check Syntax does not draw arrows from several  require subforms to the references bound by them.

No arrows for:
 - only-in
 - except-in
 - rename-in
 - combine-in
 - only-meta-in

Arrows work for:
 - prefix-in
>How-To-Repeat:
Check Syntax. No arrows from the use of 'match' to the require form.

 One of the problems with the examples from this PR is that check
 syntax doesn't see any original instances of scheme/list in the
 expansion below. Should one of those be original, or should there be
 some other way check syntax identifies the right scheme/list? (I see
 that neither of them have source location.) Or maybe there is a
 property somewhere that I'm missing?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Oh, and there doesn't seem to be anything useful in the 'origin
 property (code below that tested that).
