>Description:
Wondering about the dirty flag behavior. I don't recall it working like below, but the dirty flag only gets reset when you choose the tab itself. Pretty sure it didn't do this in the 4.x version. Maybe I need to update something in DrSync?
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrRacket.
2. Install http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=drsync.plt&owner=grettke
3. Restart DrRacket.
4. Open a tab $TAB1 and save its contants to $TMP\$FILE1.rkt
5. Open another tab $TAB2 and save its contents to $TMP\$FILE2.rkt
6. Open $TAB1 and make a change. Do not save. The dirty flag is present on the tab.
7. Open $TAB2 and make a change. Do not save. The dirty flag is present on the tab.
8. Give window focus to something other than DrRacket. DrSync will save dirty
   tabs now.
9. $TAB2 should no longer have its dirty tab flag present.
10. $TAB1 does have its dirty flag present.
11. Give focus back to DrRacket.
12. Select $TAB1. THe dirty flag disappears.
