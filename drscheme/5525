>Description:
I have noticed some oddities in the syntax checker with respect to
the colors method names are given. I have narrowed down the problem
and found three different cases. they should be apparent in the
code snip
>How-To-Repeat:
(require
 (lib "class.ss"))

(define class%
  (class object%
    (define/public i-think-i-am-a-contant
      (lambda ()
        (internally-referenced-method)
        "method's name is green. BAD."))
    
    (define/public internally-referenced-method
      (lambda ()
        "method's name is blue. GOOD."))
    
    (define/public i-got-ignored-by-syntax-checker
      (lambda ()
        "method's name is base-color brown. BAD."))

    (define/public (also-ignored)
      "method's name is base-color brown. BAD.")
    
    (define/override i-am-a-constant-too
      (lambda ()
        "method's name is green. BAD."))
