>Description:
commented definitions appear in the list of definitions shown
by the (define ...) button
Bug or feature ? If it's a feature, it probably should be documented.

There's also a small indentation problem with the listings (see below).

>How-To-Repeat:
Type:

(define foo 1)
(define foo 2)
;(define foo 3)

in the definitions window. Check the "(define ...)" button. Three "foo"
appear.

Also note that when the definitions are sorted by position, the third
"foo" appears indented in the list, while when sorted by names, all
the foos are indented the same way.

>Fix:

>Release-Note:
The bug is that the code that looks for defines just wasn't
looking for semi-colons. It still doesn't parse everything,
but not it at least looks for semi-colons.

 The indentation is a feature; this `define' popup is not actually 
 parsing your program, it's just an approximation.
 
 Try making some internal definitions or a class or unit with 
 definitions to see how the indenting helps.
