>Description:
If this is an old phenomenon, I hadn't noticed it before.
I have "Enable Keybindings in Menus" turned off.
The first letter of File, Edit, Language and Help, and the second
letter of Scheme, are underlined.  There is no underlining for
either Windows or Show.  In the Definitions window, Alt-<char>
for <char> being underlined takes me to that window, but Alt-S
and Alt-W do not.  (I believe the Alt-C bug is known.)  Yet Alt
followed by S and W take me to those windows.
This seems inconsistent and also unlike other Windows applications.
