>Description:
Contract violations on normal input and output values for functions explain what values of the inputs or outputs gave rise to an error.  Contract violations on pre- and post-conditions only say "#:pre-cond violation" or "#:post-cond violation", and don't list the specific values involved.  It would be helpful to show the specific inputs and outputs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Program:

#lang scheme
(with-contract
 here
 ([f (->d ([x positive?]) () #:pre-cond (number? x)
          [y even?] #:post-cond (integer? y))])
 (define f sqr))

Results:
