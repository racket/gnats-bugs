>Description:
It's possible to put the text-search panel into a mode where it is looking for case-sensitive matches but the "Case sensitive" checkbox is unchecked or vice versa.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open up a file that has some text in it in DrScheme and search for something. Observe that the "Case sensitive" checkbox is unchecked and searching is case-insensitive.
2. Open up Help Desk, bring up the search dialogue, and check "Case senstive."
3. Now go back to your editor window and search again. Observe that the search dialogue here hasn't changed, but searching is now case-sensitive.
4. Now check the "Case sensitive" box. Searching is now case _in_sensitive!
>Fix:
The internal state of the case-sensitivity of searching was tied to the latest value of the preference, but the check box was only changing when it was checked. So, with two windows you could get the checkboxes and the internal state out of sync.

The fix is to add a preference callback that updates the checkbox's state when the preference changed.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor was it a type error.

 You're only seeing this in dock'd mode, I presume?
