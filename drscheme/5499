When I use "Open URL" (as opposed to "Help desk"),
I get a Help desk window with an empty "Windows"
menu, and the new window doesn't show up in other
windows' "Windows" menus.

a Mac OS X bug, but I wanted to try sending a bug
report in Mac OS X anyway.]

Select "Open URL"

 It's not specific to Mac OS X.

 No. There was no error, just an empty Windows menu.

 After much searching, it turns out that this is due to the strange
 things that I believe you put into .ss. From line 545:
 
 	      (if show-frame-mmediately?	
                   (send help-desk-frame show #t)
                   (send help-desk-frame on-close)) ; in case it's never shown
 
 Since on-close is called, the framework thinks the window isn't there
 and doesn't add it to the windows menu, nor does it add it's windows
 menu to the list of windows menus to keep up to date.
 
 Since v201's help desk is going to axe this code, I see no reason to
 fix this bug and removing this line is going to create a GC problem, so
 I'll just leave it alone.
