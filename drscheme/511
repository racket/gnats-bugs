>Description:
It is possible through a sequence of operations to put DrScheme
in a state where it is running, has a window on screen, but I
cannot get a REPL from that or any subsequent window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start up DrScheme.
Click on Help.
Go back to the REPL window and click on File|Close.
Now from Help, all you can try to get a REPL is File|New.
This brings up an editor window from which I cannot get a REPL.

>Fix:

This requries inserting a different super-class into the frame class
created by hyper-frame%. The system is not currently structured to allow
these sorts of additions.

 This won't be fixed for 51. For now, use File|Open to get a repl.
