 Thank you for the bug report! I have bad news, tho...
 
 There are several such "fo-pah"s in the parenthesis matcher. We should
 really sit down and write a new one, but it is pretty low on the priority
 list around here. If you are interested in contributing one or submitting
 bug fixes, we would _love_ to have your help. The code is in
 
   PLTHOME/collects/framework/paren.ss
 
 Thanks again,
 Robby
