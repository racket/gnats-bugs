in either Defs or Interactions, and run.  The error message says:

first: expected ...

Right-click on "first" and select the last entry (Help Desk).  You get an error, because the search is for "first:", not "first".

 What did you have in mind that it should do differently?
 
 Also, I think that you must have first double clicked on "first",
 right? That is, if you just right click, then you don't get the
 "search ..." menu item.

 Ooh, yuck.  A "right" fix to this, I think, is to put a space before  
 the colon in every single error message, thus breaking a large  
 fraction of all the test cases for error messages.
 
 A wrong fix would be to strip punctuation characters out of names  
 before searching for them.
 
 A reasonably good (but more of a pain) fix would be to search for  
 near-matches rather than exact superstrings of the search string.
