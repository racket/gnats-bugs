352 freezes

Maybe this is supposed to be this way, but it seems somehow wrong to me.  If DRScheme is intentionally designed to freeze when you do this, then I apologize for submitting a bug report.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Put the cursor in the evaluation window.

 DrScheme isn't actually frozen at this point: instead, the focus is
 inside the pict box (presumably you typed something and nothing
 appeared after that, which is why is seemed completely frozen?).
 
 The focus is in the pict box, so you can create additional Scheme boxes
 inside there. If you want to read more about those boxes, have a look
 at this paper:
 
   http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~robby/pubs/papers/jfp2005-ff-color.pdf
 
 or in black and white:

 Do let me know if you have more questions.

 Yes, of course. Even on a mac (but it was an intel mac). It all worked
 just fine for me.

 As I mentioned earlier, return isn't supposed to do anything, but I
 guess you didn't meant that?
 
 Anyways, I'm kind of at a loss ... 
 
 Does DrScheme redraw itself if you cover it with another window and
 uncover it?
 
 Do any of the other "insert" menus have this effect?
 
 (I've re-added Matthew and the bug tracker to the cc list -- Matthew
 may be able to shed some light and the bug tracker helps us keep track
 of the bugs).

 (Just re-adding names to the cc list. No additional ideas, I'm sorry to
 say.)
 
 DrScheme does not cache bitmaps for its windows, nor does mac os, I
 believe, but Matthew can confirm that.

 Mac OS X double-buffers all windows, so that's why the window looks
 right even if you cover and uncover it.
 
 DrScheme does freeze for me when I try to evaluate a pict box in the
 REPL.
 
 I think the how-to-repeat part of the report is missing a step, though.
 Between steps 2 and 3, click after the pict box, which moves the
 keyboard focus, and then type Return. (Otherwise, as Robby says, the
 Return goes to the inside of the pict box, where it does nothing.)
