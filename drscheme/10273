>Description:
When I attempt to start a newly-compiled DrScheme 4.1.900, it fails to start because I have Scheme code compiled for 4.1.5 in one of my PLTCOLLECTS directories.

It pops up an error dialog, then when the button is clicked, it exits, with the following text on console.

The problematic collection in this case defines a DrScheme tool and language.

 While I won't claim this is a feature I thnk it is just going to be a
 fact of life. Unless there is something more to the story somehow? In
 general you can't mix versions like that.

 This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

 I think this is a small usability problem.
 
 In the past, in similar situations, DrScheme has always popped up the 
 error message and then ignored that code started up without using that code.
 
 I have multiple DrScheme versions installed at the same time, so that I 
 can (as in this case) test out new versions or duplicate a client's 
 environment, in addition to whatever version I use for my own 
 development projects.
 
 In my case, I could unset my PLTCOLLECTS variable when I want to use a 
 version of DrScheme other than my development one.  Other users might 
 not understand why "DrScheme crashes when I try to start it."
 
 If it's easy to make DrScheme be more resilient about finding code in 
 PLTCOLLECTS compiled for a different version, I think that would 
 probably avoid frustration for some student someday.

 Okay, I've changed DrScheme so that it handles errors that happen
 while it is loading info.ss files when searching for tools
 
 It already handles lots of errors around and related to loading tools,
 so it makes a lot of sense to add this one -- thanks for the
 prompting.
 
 I think that should be enough for this particular usecase.
