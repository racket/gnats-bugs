I think the problem is caused by the Chinese characters in the path.

 The fact that the chinese characters came out right in the error
 message in the PR suggests that maybe they were encoded wrong (using
 whatever the encoding that the bug report system uses)?
 
 Maybe?

 I have no idea what I should be doing with this.  I've never used
 either the create executable thing, or paths with non-ascii parts in
 their names.  (I've once had some zip file with hebrew paths which
 took me a while to deal with; and I set my environment to avoid any
 locale usage.)

 You can reproduce this (or not), right? It is pretty much trivial to
 try if you have a linux box.
 
 If that is too much trouble then please reassign the pr back to me.
