>Description:
I'd like to be able to rename an identifier I'm exporting with a provide/contract. Something like:

    (provide/contract (rename return m-return) (integer? . -> . m?))

I can get around this by manually defining another identifier with the name I want to export,
but I'd like to avoid that if possible.
