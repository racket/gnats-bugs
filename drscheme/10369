Re-running after a forced quit throws the error
hash-ref: no value found for key: profile-point656
It is intermittant. It occurred on the very first attempt listed below.

Start DrScheme
Run my scheme code (it is a socket server)
Connect with client
Force quit
Run again
get - "hash-ref: no value found for key: profile-point656"
>Fix:
It was possible to save your preferences in an older version of drscheme in such a way that the newer version could get confused. The newer version now makes sure that the preferences cannot get into that state.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation, but much later and without blame (maybe the blame would have been right tho -- the caller of 'eval' which is drscheme).

This is not a type error.

 Thanks for the report.
 
 Did you make it happen after resetting the preferences like I described?
