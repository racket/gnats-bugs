>Description:
There's a patch of unused window real estate at 
the lower left of the DrScheme frame.

I think it'd be useful to print the name of the 
current language level setting there.  The language 
level only appears once at the beginning of 
an interactions session, so it's not easy to 
verify the level after a long sequence of interactions.
Also, it reinforces to newbies that the language
setting is significant.

I'd also suggest that the words be a hyperlink to 
a window showing the details of the current setting.
Or maybe just a link to the Help Desk entry for that
level.

 Actually, it is used, but perhaps not effectively. Try typing 
 
   c-x;( 
 
 and 
 
   meta-space
 
 and maybe others. I should probably find a better place for those
 things, tho.
 
 Your suggestion does seem to be a better use of that space, I'd agree.
