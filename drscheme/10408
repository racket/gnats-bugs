>Description:
The error below occurred when I clicked in the "program contour" panel at the right of my program.  The exact message varies from click to click, but the argument being rejected seems to consistently be a non-integer, not always negative, and not correlated with click location within the panel.

quotient: expects type <integer> as 1st argument, given: -367.5; other arguments were: 7

The error doesn't always occur, but once it occurs, it occurs on every subsequent click in the contour panel in a given editing session.  I've posted the file I was editing, at:

 Oh, ack.  Yes, and I even had the new version already installed; just  
 wasn't using it.  Sorry, guys. --jmj
