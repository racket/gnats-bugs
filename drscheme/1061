MS Windows NT
>Description:
(I'm marking this as "critical" 'cause DrScheme doesn't recover.)
Basically, two times I've tried searching and replacing a string that contains a literal quote and both times DrScheme has hung and memory usage goes way up.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open a file in the Definitions window that contains quote chars.
2. Pull down Edit and select Replace from the menu.
3. Type a string containing a double quote in the search field.
4. Type a string containing a double quote in the replace field.

Result:
DrScheme stops responding. I get a low on memory popup from the OS.

 Thank you for your bug report. Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce the
 problem. Can you be more specific? In particular:
 
 Quoting gregp@bsquare.com:
 > 1. Open a file in the Definitions window that contains quote chars.
 
 Please send the file.
 
 > 2. Pull down Edit and select Replace from the menu.
 > 3. Type a string containing a double quote in the search field.
 
 Please tell me the string you typed.
 
 > 4. Type a string containing a double quote in the replace field.
 
 Please tell me the string you typed.
 
 Did you then click on one of the buttons in the search panel? 
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Thanks. I was able to reproduce it.

 That's fine; I am sure it is all the same bug.
