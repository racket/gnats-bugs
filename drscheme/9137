>Description:
Under Windows XP, DrScheme (version 3.99.0.9-svn5jan2008 [3m]) does not open the help desk when clicking the Help Desk item in the Help menu. It seems nothing happens. Opening the Help Desk directly from the PLT directory, opens Internet Explorer without the nice search option.

Your doing a wonderfull job!
Happy new year to all of you,
Jos Koot
>How-To-Repeat:
na.
>Fix:
I had disabled this when the old help desk went away and just hadn't gotten back to enabling it to do somethign useful.
>Release-Note:
Not a contract violation or a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 05 Jan 2008 17:40:38 -0500
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

 Apparently, send-url's result is platform-specific. I've fixed that.
 
 Thanks,
