>Description:
When an error is signalled by Check Syntax, the source text is scrolled, to show the position of the error, I presume.  However the text is positioned with the error location always two lines beyond the edge of the window.

When an error is signalled by Run, the error location is positioned as the last line of the window, which is better than the previous case, but maybe the error location should be centered in the windows, instead?

Cheers
P.

 Could you please provide a screen shot? It is hard for me to see
 exactly what you mean.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 A screen shoot will not be very useful, I think.
 
 I'll try explaining better:
 
 - I have a source file with a syntax error in line 100.
 
 - The file is in the edit buffer, positioned with line 1 as the first
 line visible in the window.
 
 - I press the Check Syntax button.
 
 - An error message is displayed, about the error in line 100.  The
 source text is scrolled, to show the text at the location of the
 error.  The line number at the bottom of the window displays 100:1.
 HOWEVER, line 100 is out of sight. In the window are visible the lines
 from (say) 70 to 98.
 
 If I hit Run instead of Check Syntax, then the line with the error is
 positioned as the last line visible of the window, instead of
 completely out of sight. This is better, but not optimal.
 
 I'll send the screenshoots if you still cannot reproduce this.
 
 Cheers
