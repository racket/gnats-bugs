>Description:
I select other font from edit menu and exit DrScheme, but the application freeze When I repeat the operation again.
>How-To-Repeat:
1 run application
2 select Edit->Preferences->Font
3 select other font from the panel
4 exit application
5 run application again
6 repeat 2-3
7 application freeze
>Fix:
There was an exception being raised by the set-string-selection that somehow was being turned into an infinite loop
>Release-Note:
There was no control violation and I don't see a type error either.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Thu, 03 Apr 2008 23:35:00 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed and released to SVN.
