 This is intentional, of course. Often you'd like to be able to read
 stuff without having to wait for all of the output, at least in my
 experience.
 
 The prompt will causing scrolling, if the caret is at the end. Maybe
 that should be the behavior for all output? Or, do you have another
 suggestion?

 Shell mode in Emacs behaves like that, and I find it very convenient.
 In cases where I want to read stuff at the same point I'll hit enter
 and left.

 What does "enter" do?
 
 In the DrScheme REPL, you cannot insert new text (except after a
 prompt).
 
 In the world I was proposing, you'd have to contrive to scroll to the
 very end in order to watch the output as it goes by, which can be
 pretty tricky if you don't know the shortcut (esc;greater-than).
 
 Maybe we should change home and end so they go to the beginning and end
 of the document, rather than the beginning and end of the line.

 Sends the command to the underlying shell (if the cursor is at the end
 of the buffer, where the active prompt is).  For example, I'll type
 
   ~/plt-work/scripts/daily-build <RET> <left>
 
 If I want to stay at the same point instead of following the output.

 Well, in an Emacs shell buffer you can, but it won't be sent to the
 running shell (unless you hit enter somewhere before the prompt which
 will copy the line to the prompt and then feed it to the shell).

 But the default behavior will be that after you hit enter, DrScheme
 starts printing stuff and you scroll along with it since it was at the
 end to begin with.

 One of the very first hacks that started by huge Emacs environment was
 to make it more Windows-like, which is actually more Macintosh-like,
 which is actually more Motif-like.  So a convenient key combination
 I'm using is ctrl-home/end to go to the beginning/end of the buffer.
 If you want to change DrScheme behavior for home/end (no ctrl) then
 consider that even the default Emacs dumped this behavior and uses
 ctrl now.

 Yes, that's what I had in mind. I was thinking about people who go back
 and forth in a long output sequence.

 Oh, is that the way of the world these days? I'll have to poll various
 apps on my system. Thanks for the tip.

 Just as often, though, you want to see the latest thing printed.
 
 Terminal (in OS X) does this right, I think. It scrolls when the scroll
 thumb is already at the bottom, but if you scroll up, then it doesn't
 force the scroll when new output is printed (until you scroll back down
 to the end).

 Well, has been for some time...  It's natural for different platforms
 to sort of settle on common behaviors.  The fact that Emacs changed is
 a pretty good indication that there were considerable pressure -- I
 think that most of the hard-core Emacs developers never use any arrow
 keys, so you can image the *huge* discussion that preceded this
 change.

 I've been discussing this with Eli and, rather than going by the
 scrollbar thumb, we've been thinking of going by the insertion point.
 It seems hard to tell when the scrollbar thumb is at the bottom, since
 by the time you get it to the bottom it may already have stuff scrolled
 past it.
 
 Does that sound right to you? Or, perhaps is there a better way to get
 the scrollbar thumb involved?

 (I'll jump in quickly -- using the cursor seems like the right thing
 to do -- I've seen several modern terminals behave like Matthew's
 description, which is basically compensating for the fact that there
 is no `cursor' like in editors.)

 That's how it works in MSVC and xterm, for example, and how I always
 assumed it should be done. But Apple's Terminal and Gnome's Terminal
 have convinced me that scrollbar-based scrolling is better.
 
 All of them scroll to the caret on input from the user, which seems
 clearly the right thing.

 Typing something (like down arrow) always scrolls to the end, so I
 haven't found that to be a problem.

 You're referring to the typing insertion point cursor, not the mouse
 cursor, right?

 [ Matthew, one of the problems with using the insertion point is that
   it isn't obvious (in the current drscheme) how to get the insertion
   point to the end effectively. The only keystroke currently is
   esc-greaterthan ]
 
 On my emacs, home and end go to the beginning and end of the line, and
 control-home and control-end don't go anywhere. This is Gnu 21.3.50.1.
 Is that an old version?
 
 In TextEdit, home and end seem to mean the beginning and end of the
 entire file.
 
 In word, home and end refer to the line, and alt-home and alt-end refer
 to the entire file.
 
 In Safari (and most browsers, probably) home and end go to the
 beginning and end of the entire file.
 
 What other apps are there to check?

 But you don't want down-arrow in the interactions window to mean move
 to the very end when in the definitions window it means move one line,
 do you?
 
 But maybe other keystrokes that would cause an insertion should both do
 the insertion and put the focus at the end? That sounds nice!

 When the caret starts at the end, each insertion keeps it at the end.
 So down-arrow or page-down happens to be a no-op in terms of the editor
 content; but, like most any keybinding, it scrolls to the caret.
 
 If you move the caret, I agree that you need a way to get it to the
 end, and I'm in favor of adding any standard binding that we can track
 down. (This problem exists independent of whether scrolling is
 triggered by the caret position or by the scroll thumb position.)
 
 > But maybe other keystrokes that would cause an insertion should both do
 > the insertion and put the focus at the end? That sounds nice!
 
 If you mean that the caret should be moved to the end before attempting
 to insert as a result of a keystroke, that sounds useful, especially if
 the caret move is part of the undo sequence for the insert (i.e., undo
 moves the caret back).

 FWIW, Ctl-end is another.

 Oh! I forgot we already had that in there :)

 No, and i'm surprised...  But it doesn't matter -- the argument was
 there, and it was huge.  I think that ctrl+home/end for the buffer
 home/end must be the default.

 Editors, mainly...  As for the above: I don't know about TextEdit,
 Word is probably behaving that way only on a Mac (every editor on
 windows does the ctrl-home/end thing), and browsers have no
 beginning/end of line so they do that without ctrl.  BTW, I think that
 in Mozilla you can toggle on a cursor mode where you actually move a
 cursor, and the rules for home/end go as in conventional editors.

 I still have to implement the other behavior and I haven't quite
 figured out what Matthew means by the scroll bar, but I think I
 realized one confusion and I'm going to go back and re-read it when I
 find time to fix the bug.
