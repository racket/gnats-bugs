 XML boxes produce xexprs which are more flexible in this sense than
 XML is. I'm not sure we want to add this restriction. Can you say more
 why adding this check is important?

 Peeking underneath the implementation, the XML box code explicitly
 allows "special snips" inside so that the splice/racket boxes can be
 put in and make templated XML. Since those are allowed, all the others
 are allowed too.

 Well-formed XML is plain text (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#dt-wellformed).
 
 From the XML specification:
 fatal error
 [Definition: An error which a conforming XML processor MUST detect and
 report to the application. ...]
 well-formedness constraint
 [Definition: A rule which applies to all well-formed XML documents.
 Violations of well-formedness constraints are fatal errors.]
 
 Therefore, an XML processor must recognize non-text as an error and report
 it.
 Calling something an XML box which is not a conforming XML processor is
 misleading.

 Yes, that's why it currently does what it does.
 
 I'm not sure what the right way to change this would be since (I
 assume) we still want to allow racket boxes in there.

 Just throwing it, currently the only XML box is like quasiquote. We
 could a different type like quote that disallowed this stuff. We could
 add more methods to the interfaces of the Racket boxes and dynamically
 detect anything else and error.

 Relabel the box to appeal to XML but so as not be in conflict with specification of XML. 
 
 The flexibility is valuable when I want to live in the X-expression world w/o being bound by XML conventions. 
 
 Rare but useful when available.

 I believe the XML reader finds a special and then calls some method on
 the special, expecting the special to return a sexp. So the XML reader
 would have to know that certain specials are not allowed, since they
 return things that could not have come from XML. This really seems
 like an unfortunate place to put the check, tho. It means the XML
 reader is going to depend on the XML boxes, which is backwards.
 
 The XML colorer could, I guess, color things red that aren't XML and
 it could scan its contents for legal things.
 
 And, of course, whatever we do, it seems easy to make it a mode. I
 don't know if it should be off by default or not, tho.
