>Description:
The DrScheme tool procedure debug:open-and-highlight-in-file has been changed to take a list of srclocs instead of a single srcloc.

But neither the documentation nor the tool contract has been updated. Client tools now get an internal error about 'map' when they use the procedure, and it's impossible to fix them without getting a contract error.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
as in the pr.
>Release-Note:
This was indeed a contract violation. It probably could have been a type error, as written. The fix, however, was to allow both a single srcloc and a list of srclocs which is not usually a legal type.

 typed scheme question: this is a fine typed scheme type, right?
 
   ((or/c srcloc? (listof srcloc?)) . -> . void?)
