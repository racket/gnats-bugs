>Description:
In Windows XP selection of text in editor or REPL sections results in selected text becoming illegible because of the colors applied to the selected text.

Instead of system "selected text" background and foreground colors, or some sane combination of DrScheme colors set in preferences, the background seems to be possibly the reverse of the DrScheme background, and text is outlined or set in Windows "selected text background text". It is hard to tell exactly whats is going on, but the result is impossible to read in any case :)

I am using zune theme from MS, but setting the default XP theme doesn't help. I am using a custom light text/dark background color scheme in DrScheme, which seems to exacerbate the problem compared to using the default colors.

This problem was present since I started using DrScheme, ca v. 371.
