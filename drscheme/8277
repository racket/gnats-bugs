>Description:
The DrScheme Programming Environment Manual, section 2.11 (Test Cases) is out of date.  It claims that a test case has 3 editable areas, when they seem to only have 2, and describes the first as being a place for a comment, which no longer appears to be part of the software.

In addition, the Test Case Doc should mention the fact that if the program contains "old style" test cases, where the output goes to the interactions pane, then the "new style" boxed test cases don't work.  This is a frustrating problem to solve without documentation.

 For now, let me suggest that you avoid the graphical test case boxes
 all together. We're still not sure if we plan to support them in the
 future.
 
 Sorry for the bad news.
