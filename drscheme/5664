 I tried to fix this PR by adding in references to the identifiers as
 part of the expansion of provide/contract. This doesn't work, however,
 since this module:
 
   (module m mzscheme
     (require (lib "contracts.ss"))
     (provide/contract (x any?))
     (define x 1))
 
 expands to (something like):
 
   (module m mzscheme
     (require (lib "contracts.ss"))
     (begin
       ...
       x
       ...)
     (define x 1))
 
 which signals an error as the module is invoked.
 
 Is there anything I can do to get the unbound-identifier check without
 getting the uninitialized identifier check?

 `(lambda () x)' instead of `x'?

 Yeah, stupid me -- how about (if #f (begin x y z ...)) instead of
 (begin x y z ...). sigh.
