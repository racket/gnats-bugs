 I've just exp-tagged a repair, in
 
    plt/src/wxwindow/src/msw_wx_dc.cxx
 
 I'm not sure how to deal with this with respect to the v206 release,
 but it's likely to be a common complaint from Windows NT/2k/XP users.

 Can this be written as Scheme patch?

 No --- it's a change to the MrEd DLL, and the change can't be simulated
 from Scheme.

 I guess releasing is easy now!
 
 Perhaps even easier than trying to make a patch!
 
 thanks, Eli!
