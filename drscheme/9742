>Description:
Undo doesn't work within a comment box
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Paste this into Definitions:
;; fun-for-circle : circle ... -> ?
;; to ...
;; (fun-for-circle ) -> ?
(define (fun-for-circle a-circle ...)
  ... (circle-center a-circle) ...
  ... (circle-radius a-circle) ...
  ... (circle-color a-circle) ...)
2. Highlight it all and select comment out with box.
3. Set focus to the box.
4. Delete the first line:
fun-for-circle : circle ... -> ?
5. Try to undo, it doesn't work.
>Fix:
The bug was that the initial state for the comment box (and xml box and text box and scheme box) editors was set to no undos (which is the default, for memory reasons).
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 13 Sep 2008 11:28:25 -0400
Reason>>> fixed and released to SVN.

Thanks for the PR!

 This is fixed now. Also, Scheme boxes, XML boxes, and string boxes now
 can undo as well. (profj's boxes still don't have undo, but Kathy has
 been alerted and told how to fix it, so it shouldn't be long). The
 string boxes icon wasn't working right either, so that's fixed now.
 
 Thanks for the report.
