>Description:
howdies -- just some strange things included in 103's beginner level;
it might all be intentional, but just in case i'll point out things
that catch my eye:

string-copy
   (similarly, eq? isn't helpful in beginner, but i can see that
    included for compatibility with little-schemer, etc.)

raise, error
  I like having *one* of these, but should there be both?
  Note that make-exn:else is also in beginner.

values   (i don't see this getting accidentally used, but still.)

void, void?, printf
   (i don't like printf w/o having begin;
    myself i'd put these into intermediate,
    as i can see introducing i/o side-effects
    w/o introducing general side-effects.)

eval, apply [are these in little-schemer? Or, to illustrate
   the interpreter in teach-scheme?]
time-apply [myself, i'd rather have just "time" in beginner]


Don't bother answering those qeustions -- they're just
me wondering to myself.
Cheers,
ian
