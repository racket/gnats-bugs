>Description:
Hi,
I frankly don't know wether this is new to the latest svn, however, I don't recall noticing it before.  On my OS X box the first DrScheme window opened has a, slightly taller than the resize box, margin at the bottom.  On subsequent windows I open (File/New) there is no margin at all when the toolbar is closed.  And with the toolbar shown, there exists a bottom margin, but it is smaller by that same amount.  It has no ill effect, I just wondered if this was by design, since on my XP box, DrScheme has equal bottom margins on all windows.

--kyle
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme on OS X box -> File/New -> Close toolbar on both windows -> no bottom margin on subsequent window.  True for all subsequent windows.

 IIUC, it is supposed to behave that way, but I'm not completely sure
 I've understood. I've put two screenshots here:

 http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~robby/tmp/wout-toolbar.png
 
 Is that what you see? If so, does it look wrong somehow?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yeah, that is weird that the first one is different. I'm not seeing
 that. Can you send along two screenshots, one with the first one and
 one with a subsequent one? Maybe that would help me figure what's up.
 
 Thanks,

 Oh, I understand better now. But I'm still not able to reproduce the problem.
 
 I started up drscheme, hit the wide button in the upper right, quit
 drscheme and restarted and I got something like your
 "subsequentwindow.jpg".
 
 Is there anything else you can think of that you've done that might
 help me figure out what could trigger this?
 
 Code inspection isn't helping ...
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
