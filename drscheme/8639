>Description:
Well, enlightenment has arrived.  I finally realized that the code that Danny You showed on how to set keybindings was meant to be consumed by the Add User-defined Keybinding... menu item.  I had just been loading it as a module in the definitions window.  This explains why it never worked for me.

However, I ran into what appears to be a problem with setting and deleting user-defined keybindings.  I tried at first to set comment-out and uncomment to d:, and d:. respectively.  Well uncomment worked, but d:, was still bound to opening the preferences window.  So I accepted that I could not override the DrScheme menu shortcut, and set them to d:. and d:/. in the source file.  Then I used the option to Remove path/schemekeys-keymap.ss, and turned around and use Add User-defined Keybinding... to add the same, but now updated, file back in as my keymap.  It didn't take.  At first I thought I might have done something wrong, but when I finally took a look at the assigned keybindings, they had the bindings from the original version of the module.

Closing DrScheme and restarting fixed the problem.  So, apparently, DrScheme is keeping some kind of cached version of a module that it uses if it sees the same name again.  Although I didn't actually try it with a different module name.  This seems like a flaw, unless there are things I don't understand.

Below find a copy of the module that I am now using.   You'll notice I've included the tool-lib.ss from drscheme in order to be able to reassign d:, to d:;, however, I don't know what function to call to open the preferences panel.  the d:, keybinding isn't listed on my system when I look at Show Active Keybindings.

 This is what I was trying to explain in an earlier message on the earlier PR.
 
 I'm glad you did eventually understand it, regardless :)
 
 For the moment, I'll probably leave it alone. My best advice for
 debugging keybindings is to get the functions working as well as you
 can outside of drscheme, and then when you're in the final stages of
 testing them, just restart drscheme. DrScheme will remember the
 keybindings files you had and load the latest version of the file.
 
 We're still thinking about the best way to handle re-loading modules.
 It isn't something that the infrastructure does well at the moment.

 PS: you'll want to go back to re-read that earlier message on the
 earlier PR to see how to rebind the preferences dialog. It tells you
 how.
 
 Did you not get that message?
