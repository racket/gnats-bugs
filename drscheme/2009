 You are in beginner mode :-)

 Presumably, you're using DrScheme.  Which Language Level are you using?

 Sure I am still a beginner!
 
 But the bug occurs at full Scheme also, so I thought that may be for
 beginners, or some other level, it could work. No chance so far.

 By the way, I am trying to port Metcast to PLT Scheme and cannot find
 documentation for the following operations:
 
 1) Writing floating numbers with a specified number of digits on the
 left and right of the decimal point. Something like fprintf in
 C. (There is a fprintf in PLT Scheme but I do not see this
 capability.)
 
 2) Create a temporary file Ã  la POSIX, like mkstemp or tmpnam do.
 
 3) Get the process id of the process running MzScheme.
 
 May be these exist and I was not using the right keywords in search.
 
 Thanks for the help,
 
 Mario

 Yes, I used DrScheme.
 
 Actually I did some more testing and found that the problem disapear
 if you don't load the package in beginner mode first. If you do, and
 turn to full Scheme and reload, the problem persists. So, I exited
 DrScheme, restarted it, check that I really was in full scheme and
 loaded the library. Now the ``if problem'' disapears.

 That has something to do with the fact that require-library only loads
 the code once.
