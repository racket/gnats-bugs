>Description:
When I access an external link from Help Desk,
and choose an external browser, I get an error 
message.

>How-To-Repeat:
In HD, choose Manuals
Choose the mysterx collection
Click on the link for downloading IE
Choose to use external browser

You get

  Cannot display URL "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/default.asp": remap-url: expected a url struct or a string, got #f

>Fix:
This was a bug in the contract checking. The contract
should have allowed #f.
