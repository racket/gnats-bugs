There are a couple of examples for 'define-cstruct'

 Matthew -- this looks like some slideshow-like convention that took
 over the rendering...  Is there a way to disable it?  (Also, I didn't
 see it described anywhere.)

 Yes. Use `#,(schemeidfont "_id")' in place of `_id' to avoid the
 underscore escape. I've adjusted the Scribble documentation to explain
 the escape, and I fixed up the foreign docs.

 The documentation bit that you added made me think that maybe there's
 a better way to do this?  Something like a `define-for-label' maybe?
 Or maybe just a simple definition of `_A' etc as the result of
 `schemeidfont'?
