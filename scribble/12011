>Description:
The Scribble codeblock documentation says that #:w/line-numbers is the option to pass in to turn on line-numbering.  But the Scribble code itself (racket/collects/scribble/private/manual-code.rkt) expects #:line-numbers, without the "w/".  Scribble won't compile if you pass in the documented option.
>How-To-Repeat:
@codeblock[#:w/line-numbers 13]
