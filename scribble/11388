>Description:
Please consider adding a "raco scribble" chapter in the
document "raco: Racket Command-Line Tools".

I was looking for such a thing since it was not 
obvious (to me) how to generate references to external 
Racket manuals that will resolve through docs.racket-lang.org.

The thread starting here was helpful and could the basis for
documentation:

Thanks.
