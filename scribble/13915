>Description:
At the beginning of the Scribble docs, located at:

* http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/

...there's a pointer to a located alleged to contain the source for those docs:

* http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/tree/HEAD:/collects/scribblings/scribble

...but that's a 404.

If I'm looking at the right thing, I believe it's moved to:

* http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/tree/HEAD:/pkgs/scribble-pkgs/scribble-doc/scribblings/scribble
