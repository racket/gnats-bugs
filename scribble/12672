This is test.scrbl:

#lang scribble/manual
@title{foo}
@include-section["test-inc.scrbl"]
@elem{at the end}

This is test-inc.scrbl:

#lang scribble/manual
@title{bar}
bazbaz

The resulting latex (from `scribble --latex test.scrbl`) has "at the end" at the beginning of the document.

 Although it's not intuitive, that's as intended. The `part' datatype
 does not currently support non-subpart content after a subpart.
 
 So, the `include-section' function includes a whole section, while
 content within an enclosing section that isn't in any subsection is
 added to the content at the beginning of the enclosing section (which
 in this case is the document).
 
 If you want "at the end" floating at the end, you can put it in its own
 section with style attributes to make the section title hidden.

 Ah, ok.  This could have been more obvious in the documentation,
 although I don't know where the best place would be.

 That's reasonable enough.
