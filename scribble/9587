>Description:
The help desk rendering problem that I first mentioned on plt-internal (http://list.cs.brown.edu/mailman/private/plt-internal/2008-May/014292.html) is still present, even in the release version of Firefox 3.

Screenshot at <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/misc/scribble-firefox-3.png>.  (OS X 10.5.4, PPC.  No firefox plugins, default firefox prefs.)

Since Firefox has not, in fact, fixed this (or fixed it for 3.0b3 and then broke it again, or fixed it only on Linux), it would be wonderful if PLT could work around it in some fashion.

 Matthew -- FWIW I've tracked this to the `vertical-align: top;' in
 `render-table'.  (But I didn't remove it, since that will probably
 mess up other places.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sat, 12 Jul 2008 08:29:29 -0400
Reason>>> finally figured this one out; tables at the start of an
itemization need `table-inline' display (not `inline')
and `text-top' vertical alignment (not `top')
