>Description:
I don't know if this is a problem with Scribble or those using it, but multiple Scribble-generated web pages that I've seen have had overlapping comments when they are close together. One example is in the HtDP 2e page in section 2.5 next to the sample problem involving UFOs at: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part1.html#(part._progstructs). Another is on Jay's course website next to section 4.1 at http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/courses/2011/fall/142/course/#(part._unix-help).
>How-To-Repeat:
Since I've never used scribble, I don't know exactly how to reproduce the problem. It seems like the problem is with creating multiple not-so-short side comment boxes close together.
>Fix:
