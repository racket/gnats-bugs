It is possible to use tag prefixes to correctly link via
tech to different sections of a Scribble document that
describe the same binding.  However, it is not possible
to use #:tag-prefixes to do the same with defproc, defform, etc.
So if there are two forms with overlapping literals,
one form's documentation will incorrectly link the literal 
to the other form's documentation.

(See the on-tick of big-bang and universe for an example of
where this is needed.)

Thanks.
