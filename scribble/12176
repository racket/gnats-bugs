>Description:
It would be helpful if the Reference sections on the various Datatypes (3.x) had pointers to the corresponding sections on the Reader (12.6.x), and vice versa.  Some of these are there already, but they're inconsistent, e.g. Reading Hash Tables (12.6.11) has no link to Hash Tables (3.13) (nor vice versa).  And Vectors (3.11) has a link to Reading Strings (12.6.6), which is clearly a typo!

 vectors.scrbl still refers to reading strings:
 
     Vectors generated by the default reader (see
 @secref["parse-string"]) are immutable.
 
 That should be "parse-vector", no?
