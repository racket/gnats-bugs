plt
>Submitter-Id:   unknown
>Release:        4.1.2
>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
I can remove development links, and setup-plt will still try to index the packages during the scribble documentation phase.  I will attach tarballs of my scribble and planet setup in a subsequent email.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add development links to planet packages with scribble documentation.  Run setup-plt and make sure they got indexed.  Remove the development links and run setup-plt again - it may try to download the packages from the server, rather than removing them from the index.

 The promised attachment for bug 9892 - untar in ~/Library/PLT Scheme/
 (or other by platform) to recreate what I hope is all my relevant
 setup for version 4.1.2.  This should reproduce the bug (development
 links not fully removed) even if you don't have the directories I
 created the links to.  Forwarded to what I hope is the relevant people
 for planet and scribble.

 The giant attachment was removed from here and moved to
 http://tmp.barzilay.org/bug-9892.tar.gz on 2012-02-06.  Hopefully it
 will stay there until the bug is closed, or until a smaller one is
 made.
