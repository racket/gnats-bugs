>Description:
It might be easier for users to submit scribble/documentation bugs if scribble pages contain a link to the bug report web page.  I know the DrScheme menu item is the best way to submit the bug, but it's in a different application from browsing now, and some of the extra information it adds is irrelevant to scribble pages anyway.  It might be possible to put some of that information back (like the version of PLT Scheme used to generate the offending scribble page) via clever web page tricks.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Thu, 05 Jun 2008 22:53:30 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "feedback" by eli at Thu, 05 Jun 2008 22:53:30 -0400
Reason>>> There is a bug-report link in the toplevel pages, is this
no what you talked about?  (If you're talking about a link
on all pages, then that sounds too cluttered for me, but
I'll just move it to Matthew and let him decide...)


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by cce at Fri, 06 Jun 2008 09:01:09 -0400
Reason>>> I missed the bug report link on the front page.  False
alarm, nothing to see here, move along.
