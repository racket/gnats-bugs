 Did you rebuild all docs (via `setup-plt') after `svn up'?

 Yes, that's build into my update script. I am re-running it once  
 again because I suspect something to be wrong.
 
 Problem is of course that building the docs takes so long.

 (In any case, it looks like there some error that could be caught in a
 better way...)

 I totally agree.
 
 The error did go away with a setup-plt -c; setup-plt

 BTW, I just ran `plt-help compile omit' and got the same kind of
 error.  This is using the nightly build, which was still as clean as
 it was after the build finished.
 
 I then ran `setup-plt' again (without -c or removing anything), and
 afterwards things worked fine again -- so there's definitely some bug
 in the scribble building process.
 
 For reference, this is the setup-plt output (for the scribble part)
 from that second run.  (The first run is available in the nightly
 build log.)

 Because it built `handin-server' and other docs in your user-specific
 area, I'm pretty sure.

 Oh, right -- I forgot about that.

 Yes, sounds like it.
 
 So it should definitely report some better error, I think, since it's
 probably going to happen again.  Some people might run it with -U, but
 I suppose that bad stuff can happen if you break a long build (which
 people might expect to do no harm).
 
 Of course all of this is a non problem if the reason is that you
 changed the format of the xref files...
 
 BTW, I just realized that the handin-server thing means that setup
 always creates stuff in your local directory -- and that's not a good
 idea.  I think that many people (who don't know enough unix) will run
 `make' as root, and there are some automated build environments (like
 the central Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu things) are intentionally very
 restricted.

 Forgot to add: so maybe it's a good idea to add a -U to SETUP_ARGS.
 Maybe do that if the user doesn't have a ~/.plt-scheme, or something
 similar.

 Then someone who does want docs for Typed Scheme or the Handin Server
 will have to jump through special hoops to get the docs.
 
 What about the idea that it's really the build for a distribution
 that's special. What if the distribution-building process just removed
 the "handin-server", "typed-scheme", and other non-distribution
 collections before building?

 Yes, I changed it slightly --- unlikely to happen again anytime soon,
 but if it does, I'll add better error reporting.

 Agreed. Any other ideas?
