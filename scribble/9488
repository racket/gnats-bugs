>Description:
The page mentioned in summary contains(near the top):

One difference between a module an a top-level definition is 

which should contain 'module and a top-level'.

The page also contains(near the bottom):

As a result, a will can be executed for a value that is managed by a custodian. 

where 'a will can be executed' is something I can't understand.
What is a "will".  It sounds like maybe some object or is it
really the verb (e.g. I "will" pay taxes)?
>How-To-Repeat:
In web browser, open:

http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/eval-model.html#(part._module-eval-model)

and search for the phrases prefixed with contains(near the ...)
in the Description of the problem.

Reason>>> Fixed the typo, and made "will" a hyperlink. (Actually, it was already
a hyperlink, but a quiet kind that only becomes apparent when you
mouse over it. We'll likely make all quiet links somewhat louder in
the future, but this one needs to be much louder.)
