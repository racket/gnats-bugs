>Description:
tried to submit a bug report about check syntax generating an stdout message and found that submit bug wasn't working

it worked the first time, I canceled, then repeatedly generated the following error message:

WARNING: open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/Users/stephen/Library/PLT Scheme/3.99.0.24/doc/handin-server/out.sxref" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
send: no such method: get-tabs for class: bug-frame%

 === context ===
/Applications/PLT Scheme Full v3.99.0.24/collects/scheme/private/class-internal.ss:3545:2: obj-error
/Applications/PLT Scheme Full v3.99.0.24/collects/gui-debugger/debug-tool.ss:134:

--
a restart resolved the submit bug error, but check syntax still generates the same message (see steps to reproduce for message)


I have seen a similar error (same "handin-server/out.sxref" file not found), on my linux/built from source drscheme when I first call the documentation with f1, but rarely notice it as it is in the terminal (which I hide after calling  drscheme)

>How-To-Repeat:
start 3.99.0.24
load some valid code 
check syntax - this generates error in standard output:
> WARNING: open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/Users/stephen/Library/PLT Scheme/3.99.0.24/doc/handin-server/out.sxref" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
Note- check syntax succeeds & works normally thereafter.
