 `deftogether' does local-expand. 
 
 While `begin' splicing might be a good idea (I'm not immediately sure),
 if you want to group multiple things together in a macro, you can use
 (a nested) `deftogether' instead of `begin'.

 I see.  The error message says:
 
 "sub-form is not a documentation form that can be combined at: (defids
 ...)" (where `defids' is the macro name).
 
 which led me to think it was looking for a particular set of
 documentation forms.  Maybe if "produce" in the `deftogether'
 documentation was changed to "expand to", that would help (it would
 have helped me).

 Ah, that's a clever idea.  Thanks.
