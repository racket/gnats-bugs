>Description:
The Reference (12.6.17.1) says that

  #lang s-exp module-path
  form ...

is equivalent to

  (module name module-path
    form ...)

but it doesn't say where "name" comes from.  The Guide explains that it's derived from the filename, but that should also be mentioned in the Reference.
