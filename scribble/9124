 Matthew: I should have brought this up earlier when we were talking
 about the mred launcher for plt help: how should we do this?
 
 I can easily add a command-line flag to plt-help to send people to the
 bug report form, but I'm not sure that's best.
 
 Suggestions?

 I'm pretty sure that such a flag will be nearly useless (at least on
 Windows, where most people are, and even on OSX, AFAICT)...  Sounds to
 me like the only sane thing to do is to tell people to fire up
 DrScheme, otherwise point them at the on-line form.

 The launcher isn't a MrEd launcher any more, so using the form GUI is a
 problem, right?
 
 How much do we rely on information gathered from the user's computer
 (by the current "send a bug report" form)? I'm sometimes grateful to be
 certain that I know which platform is involved, but mostly the web form
 seems to work ok.
 
 If you feel the same, then maybe it's enough to have a "submit bug
 report" link on the main documentation page (i.e., where plt-help
 starts) that goes to the web bug-report form?

 Yeah, the platform is the main thing, I'd say. That and the version
 number (but a link from the docs page could include both, right?).
 
 I'm willing to experiment with that for a while.
 
 (But I thought you made the launcher be a mred launcher so you'd get
 an icon, etc?)

 The link could supply the version, but not the platform (since the main
 installation docs are built once for all platforms).

 Under Windows, it's a MrEd launcher. Under Mac OS X, there's an *extra*
 MrEd launcher, but bin/plt-help is still a MzScheme launcher. Under
 Unix, there's only a MzScheme launcher.

 The bug report form can query the browser for the platform, no?

 Via Javascript, or something like that? Sounds like a good idea; can we
 make that improvement immediately?

 That seems to late. Don't we want to initialize the field, but let
 someone change it in case they're submitting a bug report about a
 different platform?

 Not javascript. The browser sends an identifying string already when
 submitting a form.

 Someone could, I guess.

 That would be better, yes.
 
 We could also use that javascript (assumign someone implements and
 maintains it) to select the right download automatically.
 
 I believe this is painful and, of course, a moving target. But perhaps
 there are javascript frameworks out there that we can use?

 (It probably wouldn't be too difficult to refactor things up so the
 mzscheme version does some limited textual form.  But the web page is
 definitely a better solution, I think.)

 FWIW, besides the platform (as below) and the version (embeded in the
 URL somehow), there is the set of collections and the language level
 that are sometimes useful.

 I think that browsers mostly send the agent version line, and I think
 that Apache's CGI interface puts that in an environment variable.  It
 should be an editable field though, since some people use a different
 system to browse.  (Like me, who usually work on linux through VNC,
 but I browse with my local (Windows) browser.)

 I'll look into this now.

 (I should have read through...)  I think that putting it in an
 editable field will work fine.  In other words, the interaction goes
 like this:
 
 * Browser on the start page, click on the bug link which has the
   version in some way like:
     http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/?v=3.99.0.9
 
 * The cgi script gets the URL and the AGENT info and composes the HTML
   that makes up the form with the string in it -- but in an editable
   field.  That should apply for the version too.
 
 * The user verifies/edits the fields and submits
 
 * At this point the cgi script is just passing the values on, no
   further editing.

 You mean for the download page?  That's less useful, I think, since
 it's more common to download on one platform and install on another.

 Probably, if you really want that.

 Uh, I forgot that the main bugs page is static, and that will require
 it to turn to a CGI script too.  I'm not too happy with moving in that
 direction, so a javascript-based solution sounds more appealing.  Any
 opinion on that?

 CGI seems way better, esp. since this one can be a very simple script,
 presumably requiring very little work on the server side.
 
 I think that the Javascript is going to be much harder to maintain.

 Actually, both of these are wrong...
 
 The reason that it's not simple is that the CGI script needs to spit
 out the usual code (eg, the title bar with the logo, the search box,
 the google widget that collects statistics).  This would be simple
 only with some magical "reflect" form that produces Scheme code that
 will reliable produce the same static HTML with some values spliced
 in.  (Easiest would be with some file that will be copied, but that
 needs to work on v3xx and v4 since the machine still has v3.)
 
 The Javascript is not really that hard -- all it needs to do is to use
 something like `navigator.platform' which (AFAICT from googling
 around) is supported by all browsers.

 Heh -- Sorry, I should have clarified my question...
 
 The main issue is that this will work only on browsers that have JS
 enabled.  I suspect that no practical browsers exist without JS, and
 that people who explicitly disable them expect to do things like fill
 out a platform field themselves...  You might have a different opinion
 on that.

 OK, here's a sketch:
 
   http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/x.html?v=3.99.0.9
 
 It extracts the `navigator.platform' and also the
 `navigator.userAgent' (after the "/") because the latter looks like it
 can contain more useful info.

 Is it possible to have an edit field with a pop-down menu? So the menu
 could be filled in automatically, but there would still be a list of
 choices?
 
 (While we're at it, I suggest renaming the "Release" field to
 "Version".)

 One irritating thing that I was happy to fix when we first added the
 bug report form inside drscheme was the memory of the user's name and
 email address.
 
 Can we bring that back? Any ideas there?
 
 (Also, it seems like web forms generally look much better than that
 these days, but I don't know why myself.)

 How does a browser's auto-fill get enabled? My browser often seems to
 know what goes in various blanks on web pages that I've never visited
 before (I think).

 We can rely on auto-fill, I guess. But I do note that it doesn't work
 in firefox or in safari with the current web form. I have no idea why.

 I think so.  -- With the previous set of choices, right?
 
 The only thing that would be difficult and unreliable is to write code
 that chooses one of these options from the browser information.  But
 since this field is just used for information of human readers, I
 think that there's no need for that.

 Ah yes, I noticed that too.  I think that "Release" comes from the
 field name, which is what Gnats uses.  I'll do that too.

 I thought about that, and it should be easy -- just make either the JS
 or the resulting CGI script set a cookie.

 You mean add some general fluff around the form?  Give me a form that
 you think looks nice and I'll copy the code...  (But no cute graphic
 files, please -- those tend to drag into HTML/CSS hell.)

 I think that it usually does that by the field name.  On IE I use the
 google thing which might use some more sophisticated heuristics like a
 preceding text since it highlights these fields for me, and the field
 names are "originator" and "replyto" which are probably not common.

 So google probably does do some guesswork.  I can try different field
 names -- just to make it a bit easier, and still use cookies to
 remember the values.
