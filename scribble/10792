>Description:
I made a Scribble example that attempts to print out the following:

Contract Violation!
Guilty Party: (function f)
Innocent Party: top-level
Contracted Value Name: f
Contract Location: #<syntax:4:0 f>
Contract Name: (-> integer? integer?)
Offending Value: 1/2
Offense: expected <integer?>, given: 1/2

It winds up word wrapping the output this way:

Contract Violation!
Guilty Party: (function f)
Innocent
Party: top-level
Contracted Value Name: f
Contract
Location: #<syntax:4:0 f>
Contract Name: (-> integer?
integer?)
Offending Value: 1/2
Offense: expected
<integer?>, given: 1/2

The result is about 1/3 the width of all the surrounding text; Scribble output should allow a lot more width for printing.
>How-To-Repeat:
<from collects/scribblings/reference/contracts.scrbl:>

@defexamples[#:eval (contract-eval)
(define (show-blame-error blame value message)
  (string-append
   "Contract Violation!\n"
   (format "Guilty Party: ~a\n" (blame-positive blame))
   (format "Innocent Party: ~a\n" (blame-negative blame))
   (format "Contracted Value Name: ~a\n" (blame-value blame))
   (format "Contract Location: ~s\n" (blame-source blame))
   (format "Contract Name: ~a\n" (blame-contract blame))
   (format "Offending Value: ~s\n" value)
   (format "Offense: ~a\n" message)))
[current-blame-format show-blame-error]
(define/contract (f x)
  (-> integer? integer?)
  (/ x 2))
(f 2)
(f 1)
(f 1/2)

 Scribble output should allow a lot more width for printing.
 
 Just as a +1, I see this all the time when I have contract violation =
 examples in the documentation I write up.
