>Description:
After running setup-plt with a development link in place that built and indexed scribble documentation, I removed the link, ran setup-plt again, and got this error message:

setup-plt: error: during Building docs for /Users/cce/plt/main/collects/scribblings/main/user/start.scrbl
setup-plt:   info-sci: expects argument of type <struct:info>; given #<path:/Volumes/Maldis/Users/cce/temp/scheme/scheme.scrbl>
setup-plt: error: during Building docs for /Users/cce/plt/main/collects/scribblings/main/user/search.scrbl
setup-plt:   info-sci: expects argument of type <struct:info>; given #<path:/Volumes/Maldis/Users/cce/temp/scheme/scheme.scrbl>
setup-plt: error: during Building docs for /Users/cce/plt/main/collects/scribblings/main/user/master-index.scrbl
setup-plt:   info-sci: expects argument of type <struct:info>; given #<path:/Volumes/Maldis/Users/cce/temp/scheme/scheme.scrbl>
>How-To-Repeat:
Same .plt file as I attached for bug 9428 should reproduce the bug; I first removed everything in the .scrbl file from the second @section[...] on to get rid of that bug when running setup-plt for this one.  (This is also the same .plt file as bug 9429.)

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Thu, 05 Jun 2008 22:55:34 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "feedback" by eli at Thu, 05 Jun 2008 22:55:34 -0400
Reason>>> I'm not sure extactly if this is a scribble or a planet bug
but after I fixed the previous bug everything runs fine for
me.  Can you verify it?


State changed from "feedback" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 09 Jun 2008 10:29:12 -0400
Reason>>> Verified; it's working for me now.  Thanks, Eli!
