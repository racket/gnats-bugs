>Description:
The example below is typeset as just "test", no underscore and in italics, but this is wrong. According to the docs, codeblock is supposed to typeset things verbatim.

Reason>>> A commit by mflatt@racket-lang.org has resolved this report
  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/5d5522ad4c
  | scribble/manual: add `#:escapes?` argument to `to-paragraph`, etc.
  | 
  | Use the new option to fix `codeblock`, which shouldn't have any
  | escapes.
  | 
  | Closes PR 14104
