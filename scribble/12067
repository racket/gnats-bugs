>Description:
The "Documentation Utilities" section of the tools manual is misplaced
in two different ways.

1. The `help/search' thing should be someplace else, it's not a specific
   tool thing.  I don't know where it should move though, either to the
   scribble manual or the racket one -- it's probably best to move the code
   too.  Alternatively, have a new manual for it.

2. The `help/bug-report' looks like it should be documented in the framework
   manual, and the code should move there too.  (Or stay in drracket and move
   into it.)
