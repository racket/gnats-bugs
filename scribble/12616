>Description:
Racket documentation environment Scribble has a command @verbatim[]
This command behaves unexpectedly and unconveniently with html output with respect to copy-paste, when its argument contains newline characters.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the source file, issue the following command:
@verbatim|{
line1
line2
line3
}|

Produce the .html output using the command ``scribble''. Navigate to the generated html page in Firefox. Locate the following lines on the generated webpage:

line1
line2
line3

Highlight them with the mouse. Then paste them into emacs by clicking the middle button of the mouse in the emacs window.
The result is:

line1

line2

line3


Notice extra newlines. These extra newlines are very inconvenient for various reasons, for example when the verbatim contains lines of code.
Expected behaviour: I am not an expert in html, but the verbatimness of the verbatim should survive copy-paste!

 (This is a result of each line being wrapped in a <p>...</p>, which is
 probably making rendering saner for other reasons.)
