>Description:
The HTML created from scribble programs looks properly, but
when you print this HTML (say via Preview/PDF) the line breaks
in code are often wrong. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Here is a small test program that exhibits the problem. 

#lang scribble/base

@(require scribble/manual)


Putting everything together, we get the following definition: 
@;%
@(begin
#reader scribble/comment-reader
(schemeblock
(define (connect-dots p)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest p)) MT]
    [else (render-line (connect-dots (rest p)) (first p) (second p))]))
))
@;%
 This definition looks simpler than the one for the faulty version of
 @scheme[render-poly], even though it has to cope with two more lists of
 @tech{Posn}s than @scheme[render-poly]. 


2. Create HTML. Use button in drracket, for example. 
The function typesets in HTML as shown above. 

3. Print (preview the print) the HTML from the browser.
The PDF version of the function introduces a line break 
in the last cond line between "connect-" and "dots".
