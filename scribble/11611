>Description:
It seems like defsignature should set up the lexical environment so that mentions of signature elements (inside and @racket[]) in the description of other signature elements should be linked together.

For example, in scribblings/raco/setup.scrbl, in the defsignature for setup-option^, the description of current-target-directory-getter mentions current-target-plt-directory-getter (inside an @racket[]). These are both @defparam's in the one signature declaration, but current-target-plt-directory-getter is rendered the way a free variable is rendered.
