>Description:
I get an internal error when running Check Syntax if
I do the following dance:

1. Open up files a.ss, b.ss, and c.ss in DrScheme
2. On a.ss, click "Check Syntax"
3. Go to a.ss, b.ss, and c.ss and rename x to y [you don't have to use the drscheme alpha renamer, just change the files manually and save]
4. Go t a.ss and click "Check Syntax" again
5. See the following internal error message appear:

find-scheme-tag: dead end when looking for binding source: x

 === context ===
/Users/jacobm/svn/plt4.0/collects/scribble/xref.ss:89:2: xref-binding-tag
/Users/jacobm/svn/plt4.0/collects/scribble/xref.ss:130:0: xref-binding->definition-tag
/Users/jacobm/svn/plt4.0/collects/drscheme/syncheck.ss:2442:4: document-variable

/Users/jacobm/svn/plt4.0/collects/drscheme/syncheck.ss:1185:35

Notes:

* After that DrScheme becomes unusable and I have to restart.
* All three files appear to be necessary, and in particular it
   appears to be necessary for an intermediate file to be
   reproviding a name. It also appears that a bound occurence
   of the changed name needs to actually be present in a.ss.
* I tried checking syntax on all combinations of files; only 
   it seems that it is necessary to check-syntax on a.ss to get
   the error (and other check syntax clicks don't affect the 
   problem either way). You must do a check-syntax click both
   before and after the name change to get the error.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description. Here are the files:

;; a.ss
#lang scheme/base
(require "b.ss")
x

;; b.ss
#lang scheme/base
(require "c.ss")
(provide x)

;; c.ss
#lang scheme/base
(provide x)
(define x 10)

 Yes, this is a problem with locating documentation for a binding.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Fri, 02 May 2008 09:27:34 -0400
Reason>>> There were two issues:

 * `xref-binding->definition-tag' was reading arbitrary module
    code in search of a documented layer. That's outrageously insecure.

    It now uses .zo files, only, which means that you can only find
    help on things for which the exporting module is compiled. That's
    not good enough (because you might have your own module that
    re-exports `scheme/base'), but I'm not sure how to fix it, which
    is why this PR is still open.

 * When modules are inconsistent, the search chain breaks, and the
   help search blames itself. It now just bails out.
