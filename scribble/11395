 As you've probably inferred, `schemeblock' currently doesn't handle the
 case that the first line is less indented than some other line.
 
 I think the future is `codeblock', which does not have this problem,
 but I'll grant that `codeblock' still has a ways to go.

 Yeap. I should have submitted it as a 'feature request' because I'd like =
 to have it for 2e.=20
