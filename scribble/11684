>Description:
In #lang scribble/lp, the @#reader scribble/comment-reader
construct is supposed to allow the programmer to use semicolon-delimited comments, just as in normal Racket code. Instead, this mechanism is broken.

The most severe way in which it's broken is that the (code:comment) form that a comment expands to is not removed when the code fragment is to be interpreted as executable code, as opposed to documentation. In the program given under "Steps to Reproduce", the (define) form doesn't compile, because the (code:comment) form is included in the program text as an illegal "multiple expression after identifier".

code:comment works fine at the top-level, however.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scribble/lp

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(chunk <foobar>
   ;; This comment doesn't cause any problems.
   (define *foobar*
           'the-value ;; This comment breaks everything.
    ))
>Fix:
