 I think the main problem here is that searching tends to land you in
 the Reference, rather than the Guide. Someone who doesn't yet know
 about boxes should start with the Guide (which does talk about the
 notation of boxes, for example). It's not just boxes and vectors; I
 think it happens ofetn that keywords point you to detailed information
 rather than an overview?
 
 What if every search request produced two sets of answers: Guide-like
 results and Reference-like results? That way, someone who is looking
 for information on the `box' or `hash' binding would find it
 immediately, while someone who wants not know about boxes and hash
 tables more generally wouldn't be misdirected to the reference.

 Sounds like a great idea to me. Maybe two columns or something?

 Matthew, I thought over it and I still don't see your reasoning.
 
 Maybe I did read the Guide.  After a while I began to use hash
 tables.  I think, "Hey, didn't I once read somewhere that there's some
 convenient syntax for hash tables?  Is it &#?  Oh wait, that seems to
 do something else...let me just do a search for hash tables."  It
 seems to me the default reader syntax for a datatype is just as valid
 to document with the datatype as its other constructors (&hash with
 make-hash, #() with vector, etc).
 
 Your general point is, however, valid, and Robby's suggestion of a
 two-column presentation is intriguing (especially since monitors are
 usually much wider than they are tall).  There are actually numerous
 things that come to mind about the Help Desk interface, but I'm
 refraining from making them for fear that Eli, driven to despair,
 might decide he's better off joining the Israeli military than dealing
 with more Help Desk edits.  I figured it's safer to wait until he
 returns to the US.

 This sounds like a good idea in general -- but presenting two columns
 doesn't sound practical (the scribble html format is very narrow
 already).  Perhaps something like a checkbox or maybe a combo box for
 different preferences, where one would be for guide links and one for
 reference.  This is also running into the problem that someone that
 uses, for example, the `mzscheme' language will want to see its
 entries first (related to Shriram's complaint about the file
 functions, due to a confusion between `mzscheme' and `scheme').
 
 *But* -- the current way preferences happen is when the index is
 generated, by pre-sorting it in a specific way, avoiding a much more
 expensive sort on the JS side.

 (Given the frustration of dealing with the JS code, that's a valid
 point...)

 Apple's docs work that way. I found it very confusing until I finally
 understood that there was a choice, and I still find it difficult to
 keep track of which mode I want to search and which mode I have
 selected, so I'd rather not go that route.
 
 Two columns does sound like the kind of results that I meant, but I
 agree that it would be difficult to make that layout work. I'll keep
 thinking about it.
