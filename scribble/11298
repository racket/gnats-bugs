>Description:
Search in Help Desk for provide.  Go to the entry for Racket.   The provide spec says there are several kinds of provide-spec clauses, eg, for-meta, for-syntax, etc.  Click on one of these (eg, for-meta).  This takes you to

(for-meta phase-level require-spec ...)
See require and provide.

In fact, there is a "sub-spec" for these that is nested below.

I'd claim that these hyperlinks should go straight to the sub-specs, rather than going to the placeholder top-level entries, which essentially take you back to where you came from, and force you to either scroll down or (if you don't realize you need to do that) go in confused loops.
