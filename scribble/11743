>Description:
Would it be possible for Scribble not to interpret -- as an en-dash (and similarly for other transformations) within a @tt?  This has the dual advantage of a) being compatible with TeX (at least with the default fonts), and b) allowing me to typeset, for example, the string "--help" in a monospaced font without having the dashes turned into an en-dash.  (I've been unable to figure out how to do that, as no combination of @literal and @tt does what I want, but that's beside the point for this bug.)

 I don't think we should change `tt', but here's a `tt*' function:
 
  (require scribble/core)
  (define (tt* . content)
    (make-element 'tt content))

 Maybe add something like latex's \verb|...|?

 I'll only argue the point so far, but I find it awfully odd that `tt' means
 "typeset the argument in a monospaced font---er, well, except for all these
 special cases".
 
 And while `tt*' works fine in some contexts, it's not a perfect solution.
 For instance, when I use it inside
 
     @examples[(code:comment @#,t{foo@tt*{--}bar})]
 
 then the -- does show up as two hyphens, rather than an N-dash, but in
 black, rather than the tan of the rest of the comment text.

 Just in case this wasn't clear, these special cases are not specific
 to tt. They are all over the place as ways to write common characters
 in ascii that aren't really well-rendered as ascii (you can get a
 sense of this by looking at the docs for tt and functions near it in
 the manual).

 FWIW, I think you have it backwards. In Scribble, `tt' really does just
 mean "use a monospace font". In Latex, it means "use a monospace font
 and also change the parsing/decoding rules".

 That's bad, and I'm inclined to blame `code:comment', which handles its
 content in a weird way. I'll look into cleaning up `code:comment' and
 related facets of the `racketblock' family.
 
 Meanwhile, you can work around the problem by avoiding decoding at the
 paragraph level:
 
  @(define (no-decode-t . args)
    (make-paragraph plain args))
 
  @examples[(code:comment @#,no-decode-t{foo--bar})]

 Ok.  I had thought that it wasn't pulling the en-dash and em-dash
 characters from the monospaced font and would in fact produce results that,
 for instance, didn't line up in the way that a monospaced font would.  But
 a brief experiment demonstrates that (at least with my browser's fonts)
 en-dash and em-dash both take up the same amount of space on the screen.
 
 W.r.t. LaTeX: one cannot change to a monospace font (or at least, not to
 cmtt) without changing these particular parsing/decoding rules.  They're
 specified as properties on the font, not as part of the general rendering
 engine.  See Appendix F in the Metafont book for details.  Whether this is
 the right design choice is an interesting and debatable question but not
 one for this bug report.
 
 I think my core misunderstanding was assuming that Scribble's typesetting
 abilities were (conceptually) based on LaTeX; it seems that you have
 instead made different design choices.  These choices may well be the right
 thing, but they add a level of habits that have to change from someone
 who's used to TeX & friends.
