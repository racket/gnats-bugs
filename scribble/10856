>Description:
In section 7.9.2 in "Extending and Configuring Scribble Output", it is written:
"Add additional accompanying files with --extra."
it should probably be:
"Add additional accompanying files with ++extra."

On a side note, having the output of the command "scribble --help" in the docs would be nice. Or at least something like:
type "scribble --help" for more info.

Best regards.

 Good point. I'll keep that in mind as I go through all the
 documentation in the near future.
