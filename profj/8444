It appears that the interactions window does not handle 'if'

mode.

In ProfJ beginner, with empty defs, hit "run".  In interactions

... evaluator is now on vacation? No matter what you type, ProfJ
sits silently and ponders.

 There used to be (and maybe still is, but if so I don't recall it) a  
 button sequence to force the interactions window to evaluate the  
 contents. In this circumstance, it needs to be pressed, if it still  
 exists.
 
 However, this is still a bug in behavior that I'll try to do  
 something about. Additionally, Beginner ProfJ doesn't allow '{' '}'  
 around the sub-statements of an if

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:10:54 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
