>Description:
1. ProfessorJ methods cannot be named "not"

2. The error message you get when you do invoke a method "not" is terrible.  

(The latter is why I think the problem is critical severity; I had a hard time realizing what the problem was when it was part of a large program, and I suspect most teachers and students will be completely mystified.)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Paste following code into ProfessorJ:

class T {
  boolean not() { return ! true; }
}
class Examples {
  boolean b = check (new T()).not() expect false;
}

2. Hit Run.

3. Observe error message:

insert in text% (character without position case): expected argument of type <character>; given #(struct:exn:fail:contract:arity "procedure not method in T: expects 0 arguments, given 1: #t" #<continuation-mark-set>)

 It's actually that you can't both have a method named not, with no  
 arguments, and use !
 
 Thanks for the report and tracking it down; I'm working on a fix

Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
