>Description:
The requirement that braces surround each clause of an if-else-if statement in ProfessorJ 4.0.1 is a major inconvenience, and will lead to much frustration on the part of students.  Combined with ProfessorJ's automatic inclusion of a closing brace whenever one types an open brace, this change causes confusion rather than clarifying anything.  It seems especially annoying given that only one statement is allowed in each clause, anyway.  Go back to the old way, please!

 One statement per branch is all you get in Beginner because there are  
 no assignment statements. I fail to understand this part of the  
 complaint.
 
 Otherwise duly noted.

 a nuisance

 Sorry, maybe I didn't make myself clear.  That was not
 a complaint...just an observation that requiring braces
 seems even less useful when the braces aren't being
 used to delimit compound statements.
 
 Thanks,

 You will be surprised to find out that we added those braces because  
 of ... teachers from last year's Java workshop.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:38 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
