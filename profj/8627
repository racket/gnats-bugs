>Description:
I'm guessing that the native Math.sqrt doesn't return "i" when
called with -1 :).  DrS does, though, and it appears that you 
shovel the difference between the got and expected off to DrS's
abs function... WHICH, come to think of it, should probably handle
complex numbers correctly by returning the magnitude of the thing.
So if you like, you could perhaps rephrase this as a feature
request for mzscheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
evaluate this code in ProfJ:intermediate:

class SqrtExamples {
  boolean testWhoops(){
    return (check Math.sqrt(-1) expect 0.0 within 0.00001);
  }
	SqrtExamples(){}
}

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:10:57 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
