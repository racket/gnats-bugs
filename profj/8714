>Description:
This program:

class Util{
    double bronk(double d)
    {
      return 14.0 * d;
    }

    Util(){}
}

when evaluated in ProfJ:Full, results in this error:

Right hand side of * should be of type double, float, long, int, short, byte or char, but given #f. in: *

This problem seems _not_ to be present in 370, thank goodness. Perhaps this is some quirk of my local setup?  Let me know if you can't reproduce this.

 By any chance, when you tried this in 370, did you use a class name  
 other than Util, because in my investigation the name of the class is  
 the bug causing the problems.
 
 (There seems to be a collision between the Util in the window and the  
 Util in lang.)

 No, I did not.  I just checked again, and the code as given seems to  
 work fine in 370 ProfJ:Full, even with the classname Util.
 
 I'm glad to know about the underlying problem, though.

 Yes, that makes sense.
