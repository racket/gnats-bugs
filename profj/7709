 Hi Matthias,
 
 Were you working on error messages for the drawing library that would  
 be more appropriate for Java? Are you close to doing this, or should  
 I try to get the messages in before we release?

 No I am not working on these error messages. I know I visited the issue 
 in the spring but I haven't done anything since. I modified the 
 interface at the same time. Perhaps a [bad] Scheme error snuck back in.

 P.S. Yes, if you could spare the time, please take on the error 
 messages.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by kathyg at Mon, 20 Feb 2006 18:18:53 -0500
Reason>>> This was corrected for the last version of DrScheme released, so I'm closing it 
now.
