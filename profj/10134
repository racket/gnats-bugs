>Description:
ProfJ will hang under certain conditions if the parens
aren't matched and the user tries to auto-indent.

Following the steps below will cause DrScheme to become
unresponsive, requiring the process to be killed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme, choose ProfJ beginner, type:

class Foo {

This will auto-insert a balancing brace:

class Foo {
}

Move the cursor past the }, delete it.  Hit tab. 
Type asdf, the buffer is now showing:

class Foo {
  asdf

Hit backspace 4 times (deleting asdf).  

Hit tab.  Farewell ProfJ.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:13:28 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
