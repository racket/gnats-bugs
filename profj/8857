 I get

 Language: ProfessorJ: Beginner.
 Syntax error detected
 Expected a ; to continue this return statement. Instead, found }  
 after 'return expression'.

 with the } after the missing semi-colon highlighted. This seems  
 reasonable to me, what do you get?
 
 Also, for the other message I get
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 371-svn9aug2007 [3m].
 Language: ProfessorJ: Beginner.
 Syntax error detected
 Expected a } to continue this method definition testDraw. Instead,  
 found && after 'method signature { statement'.

 Your version information looks a little suspicious to me as the  
 Syntax error detected printf was added August 7th, per our  
 discussion, but your version seems to be July 25th.
 
 I suspect that you updated profj but didn't update the combinator- 
 parser collection, which is what actually selects the errors.

 Why is this not a subcollection of professorJ? ARGH!

 Okay. That worked. I am now working on another bug: a free x that  
 isn't discovered and plays a critical role. I'll cut it down and then  
 submit.

 Because, although profj is the only client, the combinator-parser  
 collection is a completely general implementation that anyone could  
 choose to use to implement their parsers with error messages, without  
 having to jump through tons of hoops to get the messages. (Ok, so  
 they would have to be brave, but that's a different issue than code  
 organization).
