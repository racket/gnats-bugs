 I can take care of checking that the colorer is running before I call  
 backward-containing-sexp, but I don't know why text mode is using the  
 Java indenter. Robby?

 It doesn't have anything to do with text mode, as it turns out.
 
 The problem is that I changed profj to always include the java-keymap,
 instead of adding and removing it when the java mode is set and unset.
 
 I've committed another change to profj to fix that. Sorry.
