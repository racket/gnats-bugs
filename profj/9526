>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "kathyg" by kathyg at Thu, 19 Jun 2008 16:47:20 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by kathyg at Thu, 19 Jun 2008 16:47:20 -0400
Reason>>> Checking syntax no longer causes an internal error, committed in svn.
Please note, that check syntax doesn't do much in the ProfJ levels (it parses) 
and this will not change before 4.1
