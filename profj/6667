>Description:
The Java boxes (both interactions and comments) sometimes do syntax highlighting incorrectly. In one case, I copied some commented-out (by means  of '//') text from the Definitions window into a Java comment box. However, when I removed the leading forward slashes from the pasted text, it remained highlighted in orange.

In another case, keywords in a Java interactions box were highlighted in the wrong color.

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by kathyg at Sun, 09 May 2004 23:10:22 -0400
Reason>>> I fixed up the interactions box coloring, but I haven't
fixed the comment-box coloring. 
This error is occuring because the comment-box is not a
colorized text, but the choice of appropriate colors is not
clear.
