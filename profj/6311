>Description:
set up some mutually referential objects
(instructor and students, authors and books)
and ProfJ can't print them out.

Why does ProfJ not use the built-in printer?
DrScheme has solved the problem. Is this a
DrX research problem? 
>How-To-Repeat:
class Book {
  Author a; 
  String title; 
  Book(Author a, String title) {
   this.a = a; 
   this.title = title; 
   this.a.addBook(this); 
  }
}
 
class Author {
 String name; 
 ABL books = new EmptyBL(); 
 Author(String name) {
  this.name = name; 
 }
 void addBook(Book b) {
  this.books = new ConsBL(b,books); 
 }
}

abstract class ABL {}
         
class EmptyBL extends ABL {
 EmptyBL() {}
}

class ConsBL extends ABL {
 Book first; 
 ABL rest; 
 ConsBL(Book first, ABL rest) {
  this.first = first; 
  this.rest = rest;
 }
}
 
class Examples {
 Author mf = new Author("Matthias"); 
 
 Book ll = new Book(mf,"LL"); 
 Book ss = new Book(mf,"SS");

    ProfessorJ Bug
State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: kathyg
State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 18 15:44:11 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    ProfessorJ will no longer infinit loop when trying to display mutually referential objects using the Class+Field (old Type+Field) display option. 
    ProfessorJ does not use the built-in printer, I should (and will) look into using it, there could be a DrX research problem here.
