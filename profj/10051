>Description:
This is checked with ProfessorJ beginner's level.
When trying to create a new object in the interaction window the parser complains:

> new Tea("xx", 2,2);
Syntax error detected
. Expected a ) to continue this class instantiation. Instead, found "(xx #<position>)" after 'new identifer ('.

Then I wrote:

> new Tea();
Syntax error detected
. An error occured in this expression. Possible options include literal expression, this, or identifer.

An finally:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.4 [3m].
Language: ProfessorJ: Beginner custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
This program should be tested.
> Tea mydrink = new Tea("xx", 2,2);

Evaluation of this statement does not terminate.

 Thanks for the bug report.
 
 While your first two error are bugs with the parsing reporting, I  
 can't identify any problem immediately with the third. Could you send  
 me the definitions you used for the Tea class?
 
 In the other two errors, the parser should have reported that the ';'  
 should not be included.

 Never mind. Nontermination was the correct behavior for the code.
 
 Sorry

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:13:25 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
