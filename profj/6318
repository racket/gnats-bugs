>Description:
I tried to use Math.abs in a program - and did not add #include, 
but the message I got is completely confusing - even to me:
length: expects 1 argument, given 2: (#(struct:id Math #(struct:src 17 10 333 4))) 1
>How-To-Repeat:
Math.abs(-3);

even when used alone as a test

Responsible-Changed-When: Fri Jun 13 17:14:08 2003
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    ProfessorJ bug
State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: kathyg
State-Changed-When: Fri Jun 13 17:14:08 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    The internal error about length getting the wrong number of arugments has been fixed. 
    Calls to Math.abs(N) will still fail for 2 reasons. 1) The Math library has not been incorporated into ProfessorJ yet. 2) Intermediate does not allow students to use static fields or methods.
