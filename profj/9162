 David, thanks for the report. Please keep sending these kinds of  
 reports.  While it is easy to test that a system works properly, it  
 is hard to build a good test suite for how it deals with errors that  
 originate with people (especially when the creator of the software  
 isn't around to watch students).

 Kathy, by all means use this last semester now to build a proper test  
 suite with examples that don't parse. Any commit and any release  
 should run this suite automatically and ensure that errors are dealt  
 with properly. That's why ProfessorJ matters. If it can't do that, it  
 has almost no right to exist.
 
 You can't ask for a better reporter than David.

 Will do.  I also noticed that the error that should have been reported, 
 the one which hints at this potentially being an instance of a spelling 
 error, in fact has a spelling error: "capitolization" => "capitalization".

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:11:51 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
