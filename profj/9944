>Description:
Here's a fun one that came out of my attempts to implement an assignment in Matthias' class this semester.  (Of course the code below has been reduced considerably. :)  )

I suspect that the presence of a method named "not" is the problem; the bug goes away if it is renamed to e.g. "n" 
>How-To-Repeat:
1.) Type the following code into ProfessorJ:

class T {
  boolean not() {
    return ! true;
  }
}
class Examples {
  boolean b = check (new T()).not() expect false;
}

2.) Hit Run.

3.) Observe the unfortunate error message:

insert in text% (character without position case): expected argument of type <character>; given #(struct:exn:fail:contract:arity "procedure not method in T: expects 0 arguments, given 1: #t" #<continuation-mark-set>)

 Sorry, this is a duplicate of 9945.
 
 (I forgot that I had already submitted it and so I wrote the bug up  
 again.  I think the 9945 phrasing is better.)

Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
