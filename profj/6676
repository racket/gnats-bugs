State-Changed-From-To: open->suspended
State-Changed-By: kathyg
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 29 00:11:37 2004
State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed the error message to report that equal(Cons) has not been implemented. (and tagged in cvs)
    In the future, I should try to mention the unintentional overloading that occured.
State changed from "suspended" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:10:24 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
