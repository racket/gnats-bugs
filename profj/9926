>Description:
This is for DrScheme v4.1.2 and v4.1.2.2-svn29oct2008.

The Test Results window from ProfessorJ's
check/expect form has a close button at the
bottom, and if you only use that, things
seem to work fine.

But there is also the close methods provided
by the window manager, such as the big red
button in the upper left corner on Mac OS X.
Also, when you hit Run in DrScheme again, 
the Test Results window will be automatically
closed.  Either of these alternative usage
patterns lead to internal failures within
DrScheme the next time you have a failed test.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type the following code into ProfessorJ: Intermediate
class AnExample {boolean test = check (1 == 2) expect true;}

2. Hit run.

3. Close the resulting Test Results window using your window manager 
(*not* using the close button). 

4. Hit run again.  Note the absence of a Test Results window, 
and the presence of a message like the following:

get-editor in editor-canvas%: object (shutdown by a custodian): #<object:.../private/wxcanvas.ss:16:4>


VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: step 3 above is actually optional.
Hitting run twice in a row is sufficient to duplicate the
bug, which makes this problem even more annoying than
it already is.
