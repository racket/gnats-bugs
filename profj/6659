>Description:
The ProfessorJ error messages are often very vague and unhelpful to users unfamiliar with Java. Also, the often do not give a line number reference for the error.

One example:

---CODE---
abstract class AMail
{
   int weight;
   int rate;

   AMail(int weight, int rate)
   {
      this.weight = weight;
      this.rate = rate;
   }
}

class Letter extends AMail
{
   Letter(int weight, int rate)
   {
      this.weight = weight;
      this.rate = rate;
   }
}
---END-CODE---

Executing this bit of code in ProfessorJ gives the rather mysterious (to a new user) error "super: method super from this class expects 2 arguments with types (int int). Given 0 arguments with types () in: super". The hardly conveys the actual problem - that a constructor is not allowed in an abstract class. The lack of a line number to indicate where the problem was found only makes it more difficult to debug.
