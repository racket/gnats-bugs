>Description:
In DrScheme 4.1.2 and in 4.1.2.2-svn29oct2008,
the test results from failed check/expect
forms has placeholder text "Highlight covered
expressions" scattered throughout.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Type the following code into ProfJ Intermediate:
class AnExample {boolean test = check (1 == 2) expect true;}

2. Hit run.  The Test Results window says something like:

Ran 1 check.
0 checks passed.
Highlight all covered expressions
Ran the following Example classes:
AnExampleHighlight covered expressions
AnExample  contained failed checks.Highlight covered expressions
  check expected value to produce true , instead found false . At line 1 column 32

3. Note that the above text is hard to read 
(due to all of the "Highlight covered expressions").
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:59 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
