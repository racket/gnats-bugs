>Description:
For the code below I get a parse error near 
 Square bb() {
   return new Square(this.loc, this.size);           
the comma after this.loc.
For all other levels it reports:
AShape: AShape is illegally dependent on itself, potentially through other definitions in: |AShape|
The code runs fine in other Java environments.
>How-To-Repeat:
// ~\ref{fig:shape-methods}
abstract class AShape{ 
  
 // to compute the bounding box for this shape
 abstract Square bb();          
}
         
class Square extends AShape{
 CartPt loc;
 int size;
 
 Square(CartPt loc, int size){
  this.loc = loc;
  this.size = size;
 }
 // to compute the bounding box for this shape
 Square bb() {
   return new Square(this.loc, this.size);           
 }
}

class CartPt{
 int x;
 int y;
 
 CartPt(int x, int y){
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
 }
}

class TestShapeMethods{
 CartPt cp2 = new CartPt(20, 50);               
 AShape s2 = new Square(cp2, 30);
  
 // testing method: bb() - for Square
 boolean b12 = (s2.equals(((Square)s2).bb())); 
}
