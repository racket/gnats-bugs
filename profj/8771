>Description:
The attached program runs in about 3 seconds in ProfessorJ
[Advanced] but goes into a virtual infinite loop (reproducable)
in [Intermediate]. DrScheme's memory usage jumps to 1.5G real 
memory and 2.3G virtual memory within seconds. This is a fresh
newly started drscheme. 

I am running Kathy's changes from today in 370.4.

 I can confirm this bug on today's release (370.4).

 Can you confirm that this bug has been corrected?
 I can't quite tell from my e-mail time stamps if my fix of this bug  
 and your report occurred simultaneously or if this is a response to  
 my saying that I'd found and fixed an infinite loop bug.

 The time stamp of the email message pretty much is a minute or so  
 after I updated BUT svn up showed that we crossed and the check  
 confirms that I get another bad error message :-)

 Welcome to DrScheme, version 370.4-svn25jun2007 [3m].
 Language: ProfessorJ: Intermediate.
 Constructor Bounding, expecting one argument with type Circle,  has  
 already been written in this class, Bounding, and cannot be written  
 again. in: Bounding
 
 which isn't particularly comprehensible.
 
 So close the bug report but look at the error message :-)
