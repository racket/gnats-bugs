>Description:
AFAICT, Java allows fields in interfaces only if they're 
declarations of constants.  ProfJ seems not to enforce this.
I don't see any reason why this would be a deliberate design
decision, so I'm guessing that it's an oversight.
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate in ProfJ:Advanced

interface Foo{ int a; }

no error occurs
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:03 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
