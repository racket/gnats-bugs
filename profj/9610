>Description:
The following message in a program with numerous methods fails to identify the offending line:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.0.2 [3m].
Language: ProfessorJ: Intermediate.
Syntax error detected
. An error occured in the return statement. Possible errors were: 
 	Expected a ; to continue this return statement. Instead, found ) after 'return expression'.
	An error occured in this expression. Possible options include field access, method invocation, or binary expression.

> 
>How-To-Repeat:
The error was caused by an extra parentheses in the middle of the program:

     
  /** Produce a list of only the books with the title "Joy" - from this list. */
   ILoBook onlyTitle3(ILoBook blist){
     return onlyTitleAcc(blist, new MTLoBook()));
   }
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:40 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
