 I have that message (worded a little differently) when students attempt to
 make an instance of an abstract class.

    > AFoo a = new AFoo();
    AFoo: Instances cannot be made of abstract classes, class AFoo is 
 abstract in: AFoo
 
 This is just too verbose. Here is a possible improvement:
 
    AFoo: is abstract; it is impossible to create instances of abstract 
 classes.
 
 What's the problem Mike?

 If you meant field selection, as in
    > AFoo a = new AGoo(0);
    > a.i
    i: field i not found for object with type AFoo in: i
 then this is the best you can do.

 Um, I think that the problem specification has become a bit obscured in this
 thread. My problem was that I defined two classes (no instances) and it told
 me I had an arrity mismatch. There was not application in my program and
 the error had not source location.

 I don't quite see how it's bogus... I enter this program:
 
 abstract class Foo {
   int y;
   Foo (int x) {
     this.y = x;
   }
 }
 
 class Bar extends Foo {
   Bar (int f) {
     this.y = f;
   }
 }
 
 and I get:
 
 super: method super from this class expects 1 arguments with types (int). Given 0 arguments with types () in: super
 
 This doesn't seem like intended behavior. I get application error when I have
 no applications in my program.

 I also don't think Mike's report is bogus. In beginner, I shouldn't have
 been allowing students to have a constructor in their abstract classes
 (especially not with how other things are set up).
 I've fixed the check for this happening, and closed the bug report...
 although apparently an e-mail about that wasn't sent, which I don't
 understand...
