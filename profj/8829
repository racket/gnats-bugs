>Description:
When using the 'check expect' in ProfessorJ, I clicked on 'show covered expressions'.  This changes the coloring of the code.  There is then no way to change the coloring back to what it was before (or at least Kathi, Viera and I do not know how to do it).  This happens on a Mac (with DrScheme v370p1) and a PC (DrScheme v370p2).
>How-To-Repeat:
Create Java code with 'check ... expect' to check the program.  When the results of 'check ... expect' are displayed, click on "Show covered expressions".  The color of the code will then be changed.  I can get the coloring back by selecting all the code and then performing a cut/paste.

 Typing in the buffer should restore the original colors; did a simple  
 edit in the definitions window not restore the colors?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:11:14 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
