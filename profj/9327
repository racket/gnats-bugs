>Description:
Evaluating expression in the ProfJ REPL only seems to work correctly when the cursor is at the end of the expression. If the cursor is somewhere in the middle of the expression pressing "return" yields the following internal error:

send: no such method: do-return for class: ...ts/slideshow/tool.ss:350:8

 === context ===
/Applications/PLT Scheme v372/collects/mzlib/private/class-internal.ss:3442:2: obj-error
/Applications/PLT Scheme v372/collects/profj/tool.ss:93:49
call-with-break-parameterization

(Language level: ProfJ intermediate)
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter a simple and valid expression on the REPL such as "3+4+5". Move the cursor back, e. g. place it after the second "+". Press return.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:16 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
