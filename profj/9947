>Description:
When more than one method matches an overloaded 
invocation, it would be good if the error msg
emitted by ProfessorJ *said* so.

Right now, the error msg could easily be interpreted
as saying that you are attempting to pass a value
that does not have the appropriate type.  
(As in, I ended up cutting and pasting my code 
into a file and compiling it with javac to try to
understand my type-error; only after doing so did
I realize that my problem was an ambiguous overload
resolution, rather than a subtyping error.

Here is ProfessorJ's error message for my example:
  constructor for this class expects arguments 
  with type(s) (Ia, Ib), or (Ib, Ia). 
  Given (Ib, A) in: C

Here is Javac's error message on the same example:

  reference to C is ambiguous, both 
  method C(Ib,Ia) in C and method C(Ia,Ib) in C match
  Ia m(Ib x)     { return new C(x, this); }
                          ^
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run the following code in ProfessorJ.  If you like, compare its error message to that of Javac, Jikes, etc...

interface Ia {}
interface Ib extends Ia {}
abstract class A implements Ib {
  Ia m(Ib x)     { return new C(x, this); }
}
class C extends A {
  C(Ib y, Ia z) {}
  C(Ia y, Ib z) {}
  // C(Ib y, Ib z) {}
}
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:13:17 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
