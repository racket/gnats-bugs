>Description:
For the program

 class Foo {
   Foo () {}
 }

 public class Bar {
   Bar () {}
 }

the v370 error message is good:

  Expected class definition, found
  'public' which may not be written here

with "public" highlighted.

In v370.6, pink highlighting covers the
buffer from its start to the end of
"public", with the error message

 An error occured in this program body,
 one of class definition or interface
 definition is expected here.

The error message isn't bad, but the
highlighted range is misleading
(since it starts at the beginning)

[Thanks to Geoffrey K. for trying
 to provoke bad error messages during
 the workshop here.]

>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "kathyg" by kathyg at Mon, 06 Aug 2007 11:19:43 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by kathyg at Mon, 06 Aug 2007 11:19:43 -0400
Reason>>> ProfJ syntax highlighting rationally now highlights just the 'public' in svn
