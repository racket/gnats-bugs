This is wrong.  

Note that 
ProfessorJ: Advanced and ProfessorJ: Full
properly signal an error when the obligation
is not fulfilled; this is a problem with
ProfessorJ: Intermediate + access in 
particular.

Since the point of having the 
Intermediate + access language level is 
presumably to instruct students about how
to use and write access modifiers, this is
particularly bad.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run in ProfessorJ: Intermediate + access:

interface I {
  public int f(int x);
}

class C implements I {
  protected int f(int x) {
    return x;
  }
}

class D implements I {
  int f(int x) {
    return x;
  }
}

2. Note the following output:
Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.2 [3m].
Language: ProfessorJ: Intermediate + access; memory limit: 512 megabytes.
This program should be tested.
> 

but should get something more like the following:

. Method f, expecting one argument with type int,  must be at least public to implement the f, expecting one argument with type int,  method from I; protected access is not sufficient. in: |f, expecting one argument with type int, |
and
. Method f, expecting one argument with type int,  must be at least public to implement the f, expecting one argument with type int,  method from I; default access is not sufficient. in: |f, expecting one argument with type int, |

 Kathy, note this is a duplicate of the bug report I sent two weeks ago.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:13:20 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
