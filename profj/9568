>Description:
In 372 the following line:

Show mwc = new Show("Married With Children", 25, new Time(21,00), 1); 
                                                             ^^
highlighted 00 as shown and produced error message:

Expected an expression, octal formatted number 0 is not the valid beginning of an expression

In 4.01

Show mwc = new Show("Married With Children", 25, new Time(21,00), 1); 
                                           ^
highlight is as shown and the message says:

Expected a ) to continue this class instantiation. Instead, found , after 'new identifer ( a list of arguments'.
>How-To-Repeat:
class Time {
  int hours; 
  int minutes; 

 Time (int hours, int minutes){ 
  this.hours = hours; 
  this.minutes = minutes; 
 } 
} 

class Examples { 
  Examples() {}

  Time t1 = new Time(22,15); 
} 

class Show {                     
  String title; 
  int channel; 
  Time time; 
  int duration; 

  //Constructor

  Show(String title, String channel, Time time, String duration){
    this.title    = title; 
    this.channel  = channel; 
    this.time     = time; 
    this.duration = duration; 
  }
}

class Examples { 
  Examples() {}

  Show mwc = new Show("Married With Children", 25, new Time(21,00), 1); 

}

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:13:56 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
