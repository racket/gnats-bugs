I don't want to explain lexing in HtDC anyways.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by kathyg at Wed, 26 Sep 2007 10:42:04 -0400
Reason>>> When this bug report was initially sent, I discussed with Scott the possibilities 
of changing the message the lexer reports; as I recall, customizing the error 
message of the lexer is a very difficult step and may lower the quality of 
illegal character reporting that is possible. 
I will try to revisit this issue in the future 


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:11:12 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
