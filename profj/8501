>Description:
With multiple calls to a method where one call has a badly formed argument, 
the source location--and text!--of the other call may be cited.

Here's the error message given for the program in the lower window:

A ',' is required between expression in a method call, found +

... and here's the line that's highlighted:

    this.functionA(i + 2);

I'll admit, this error had me completely baffled when I encountered it in 
lab. I'm still struggling to understand what kind of mistake could cause 
this error.

Awesome!
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this code in ProfJ Intermediate:

class MyExamples{
    
  boolean functionA(int i){
    this.functionA(i + 2); 
  }    


  boolean functionB(){
    functionA(6 1);
  }
}

To explain what happened, the parser got stuck on this.functionA(1 +2); Any 
parse error after this point would have flagged this location as the error. 
(Problems like this are why I'm trying to move to a different parser)

 Ah... gotcha.  I was amazed by this error, and I thank you for your  
 explanation.
