 I consider the error message misleading only in that it refers to  
 this. newBook(...) looks like a method application otherwise. So the  
 question is why does ProfessorJ jump to the "this" conclusion and  
 what should we substitute for it?
 
 BTW, Kathy I assume you still don't think the svn version is ready  
 for the Workshops?

 It is appropriate that ProfessorJ assumes it is an application.
 
 It would be more helpful to say there is no  method newBook defined  
 in the class Book - but I guess not having 'this' preceding it  
 triggers the error message before we even know that there is no such  
 method.

Subject: Re: [plt-bug] all/8808: ProfessorJ Beginner gives a misleading error message
Date: Wed, 18 Jul 2007 00:02:33 +0100

 The problem with identifying the code below as anything other than a  
 mistaken method call is that newFoo() is a perfectly valid method  
 call, and no ProfJ hasn't yet fully realized which class to look in.  
 Using AI or using human understanding to build an expert parser, I  
 don't see a means of separating this case from what the user actually  
 intended, at least not in general. (If I do better in this case, I  
 will with certainty do a lot worse in a lot of other cases.)
 One problem with Java is that the syntax can be ambiguous as to the  
 error and there are circumstances where I can't provide the best  
 error to the student unless I'm sitting in front of the computer with  
 them.
 
 As to the svn version's readiness-- I haven't encountered an error  
 and neither have you in a while (that you told me about, and I don't  
 imagine you wouldn't tell me), but the users might still be guinea  
 pigs. I'd say it's up to the person teaching the workshop what they  
 want to do... but if they're using the svn version I should be  
 informed and the workshop runners should be ready to update quickly,  
 and then I'll be at the ready to fix anything that comes up as fast  
 as I can.

 In that case, I propose you identify it as a method call without  
 target expression. Whatever terminology you use, I will use, too. In  
 parenthetical terms you can say "You can't use 'this.' because  
 ExamplesBlah doesn't contain a method called newBook."

 I haven't used ProfessorJ in a week, I only returned to the book  
 yesterday. And it's difficult to write code if you can't have typos :-)
