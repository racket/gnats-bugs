>Description:
Entering an integer that gets interpreted as an out-of-bounds octal number (say, a New England area zip code containing an 8 or 9) produces rather confusing errors about commas being required between arguments, or extra input. It would be more helpful - especially for beginners who may have no idea what the heck octal even is - if the errors were a little more specific.
>How-To-Repeat:
Given this for definitions:

---DEFS---
class City
{
	String name;
	int zip;

	City(String name, int zip)
	{
		this.name = name;
		this.zip = zip;
	}
}
---END-DEFS---

And this in an interactions box:

---INT---
City c1 = new City("Methuen", 01844);
---END-INT---

ProfessorJ gives this error:

"A ',' is required between constructor arguments, found value 844"

Entering "01844" on the interactions window gives this error:

"Only 1 statement, expression, or definition is allowed, found extra input value 844"

    exp-tagged ProfJ provides more information that something is incorrect with the number (colors it in the error color, and the parser informs that something like 080 is not a valid number).
