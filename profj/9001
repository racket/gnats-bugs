>Description:
The error message for a mis-formed import statement is unhelpful, and nothing
is highlighted.
>How-To-Repeat:
evaluate this program in ProfJ:Advanced:

import geometry*;

(note the lack of a '.' between geometry and *)

See the error message:

Syntax error detected
An error occured in the program. Possible errors were: 
 	Expected a package to begin this package specification, instead found import.
	An error occured in this class or interface; expected class definition or interface definition instead.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:11:28 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
