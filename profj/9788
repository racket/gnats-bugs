>Description:
Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.0.3-svn18sep2008 [3m].
Language: ProfessorJ: Advanced; memory limit: 384 megabytes.
. Illegal cast from class or interface Double to primitive, double.
Class or interface types may not be cast to non-class or interface types in: cast
> 

The message is backwards - I was casting 'double' to 'Double' in the shown program --- and the program should not fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
// to represent a location on a map in latitude and longitude coordinates
class Location{
  double latitude;
  
  Location(double latitude){
    this.latitude = latitude;
  }

  // convert the latitude to y coordinate
  int toY(){
    return ((Double)this.latitude).intValue();
  }

 ProfessorJ does not support the auto-boxing features of (I believe)  
 Java 1.5, therefore this program should fail (but it should get the  
 order right, which I will investigate).

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:53 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
