>Description:
I just stumbled over this *awful* bug in my own code: 

class Falling {
 int x; 
 ...
}

class Star extends Falling {
 Star(int y) { super(x, ;; <------------------ FREE X ----- 
   y,5,new Yellow()); }
 Star drop() { return new Star(this. y + this. deltaY); }
}

What looks like a free x here (in my first exercise on inheritance) 
is a field access. BUT I just had to change the language level, too. 

I just didn't understand for five minutes that this x is actually a
this.x and therefore just initialized to 0. I spent 5 minutes on this. 
[The 'x' should have been a 20.]

An undergraduate would either not discover this OR spend a HUGE 
amount of time on it. 

Two solutions: 
 1. Keep the 'this.' requirement for field access until assignment is introduced. 
 2. Do not auto-initialize fields until assignment is introduced. 

I think we should do both!!!

Java's field access SUCKS.

 Well, technically we already do both, since Intermediate supports  
 assignment.
 
 However, I think it would be good to force this. and full  
 initialization (they can type null) through intermediate anyway.

 Well, yes... along with lots of other things in Java.

 AH, I thought we had postponed assignment to Advanced and that this  
 was the reason for introducing Intermediate plus access. 


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:11:16 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
