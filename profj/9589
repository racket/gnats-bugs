 I must say that for a language with ugly syntax the idea of this  
 error message isn't bad. I'd formulate it as
 
 An error occurred in the return statement.
 Expected a ";" to end this return statement. Instead found "(".
 
 And nothing else. -- Matthias

 The bug I fixed on the plane does fix the underlying problem in this

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:34 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
