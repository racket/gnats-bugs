 I can see how one might define any bug as a "feature", but my program
 does not even open any files! How can it possibly make sense to call
 this a change request and not a bug?

 In Full and dynamic, much like in Java, referring to a class is  
 referring to the file containing the class. There is no C.java  
 (perhaps that portion should change to reflect the .java), that you  
 were implicitly looking for, so it can't be found.

 Even javac can do a better job than that!
 
 % cat ~/tmp.java
 class C implements I {}
 % javac ~/tmp.java
 /Users/robby/tmp.java:1: cannot resolve symbol
 symbol  : class I 
 location: class C
 class C implements I {}
                    ^
 1 error
 Exit 1

 Does the following message make the situation clearer?

 Required file C.java, for class or interface C, not found in: file- 
 not-found

 In a tool design for students, I just can't see how we can consider
 this a file-not-found error, instead of a "unknown type" or some kind
 of error like that.
 
 For profj+dynamic, (for now) I don't much care.

 The teaching languages don't get this error message; they get one  
 saying Class ~a is not known.
 (Which is presently changing to Class or interface ~a is not known)
 
 I'm going to suspend this report (at least until after the release).

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by kathyg at Sun, 11 Dec 2005 23:32:37 -0500
Reason>>> Error message has been modified slightly, to reflect C.java not found for class or 
interface C. WIll investigate further after 300.

 FWIW, it is okay to leave open reports until after the release.
