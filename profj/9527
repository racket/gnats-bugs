>Description:
In the ProfessorJ:Full language level, syntax errors expose the names of 
parser data structures.  I think that it would be better simply to say "Parse
error" than "Parse error near <O_BRACE:#f>, especially since the offending 
source location is correctly highlighted in red.
>How-To-Repeat:
In ProfJ:Full, evaluate

class foo {
 enum thing {a,b,c};
}

>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "sw-bug" to "change-request" by kathyg at Thu, 19 Jun 2008 16:50:58 -0400
Reason>>> The current behavior is intentional and is very useful for parsing Full files 
outside of DrScheme. 

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "kathyg" by kathyg at Thu, 19 Jun 2008 16:50:58 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by kathyg at Thu, 19 Jun 2008 16:50:58 -0400
Reason>>> My plans don't include changing the behavior as requested; I do hope at some 
point to connect the full language to the automatic-error-message parser.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 14:12:23 -0500
Reason>>> ProfessorJ is no longer distributed with Racket.
