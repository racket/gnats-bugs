Feature request:

Honu needs a math library:
  - pi
  - sqrt (especially important for the HtDCH exercises!)
  - floor, ceiling, truncate, round, etc.
  - integer-to-float conversion
  - trig functions

Of course, we'll need to think about how we want to present this to programmers: C-style top-level functions, Java-style static methods in an uninstantiable class, or something else?

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 04 Oct 2005 14:37:15 -0400
Reason>>> Carl has taken over the Honu implementation.


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Wed, 05 Oct 2005 12:26:00 -0400
Reason>>> Currently soliciting opinion on the implementation of numeric operations.


State changed from "analyzed" to "suspended" by cce at Thu, 13 Oct 2005 12:31:00 -0400
Reason>>> As stated before, soliciting opinion on design decisions.

Reason>>> Honu no longer supported.
