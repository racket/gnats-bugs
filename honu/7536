>Description:
Stevie's Honu collection.  I can specify init args in two places: in the class header and in the class body (likewise for structs and mixins).  The docs should describe briefly how the two differ semantically (if, indeed, they differ at all).

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sstrickl" by sstrickl at Mon, 15 Aug 2005 14:17:02 -0400
Reason>>> Changing person responsible for bug appropriately


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sstrickl at Wed, 24 Aug 2005 17:15:59 -0400
Reason>>> analyzed


Responsible changed from "sstrickl" to "cce" by cce at Fri, 30 Sep 2005 16:49:07 -0400
Reason>>> Honu implementation transferred from Stevie to Carl.

State changed from "analyzed" to "open" by cce at Fri, 30 Sep 2005 16:49:07 -0400
Reason>>> Stevie analyzed the problem; Carl has not.


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Wed, 05 Oct 2005 12:22:27 -0400
Reason>>> Will investigate implementation of init arguments and document behavior.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 07 Nov 2005 14:58:57 -0500
Reason>>> Documentation was updated after first round of feedback; primary consensus is 
that initialization needs to be changed in the long-term.  Documentation now 
exists; it may be unclear but so is the current implementation.
