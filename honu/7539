>Description:
Unless I'm reading the grammar wrong, the following should parse:

struct TestC() : Test {
    int m(int x, int y) {
        cond {
            x < y => 1;
            x == y => 0;
            else { 2; }
        };      // <<--- this gets highlighted
    }
}

However, I get a "parse error near C_CURLY", and it highlights the curly brace on the indicated line.  If, however, I add a semicolon to the end of the previous line (after the else clause's block), the program parses and type-checks.

So the documentation and the parser are out of sync.
