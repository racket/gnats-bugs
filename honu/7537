>Description:
It is not possible, given Honu's type system and supplied primitives, to divide an integer by a floating point number (or vice versa).

Even the really ridiculous attempt below fails with a run-time error, because "16" isn't a floating point number:

    stringToFloat(intToString(16)) / 4.0

The language needs some way to convert between integers and floats; I'll leave open the question for the moment of whether these should be implicit or explicit conversions.

Reason>>> analyzed


Responsible changed from "sstrickl" to "cce" by cce at Fri, 30 Sep 2005 16:49:56 -0400
Reason>>> Honu implementation transferred from Stevie to Carl.
