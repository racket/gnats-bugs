MS Windows 98
>Description:
Not a bug, but cannot use MysterX until it's fixed!

When attempting to install MysterX, 
all the appropriate files are unpacked and copied to the correct locations,
but the installation then dies claiming not to be able to find mysterx.dll.

I think this is because part of the path has been specified using forward
slashes, and Windows 98 cannot handle it.  I have not tried under NT yet.

The path that is reported as not found is the following:-
<c:\dev\plt\collects\mysterx\compiled/native/mysterx.dll>

maybe <c:\dev\plt\collects\mysterx\compiled\native\mysterx.dll> would cure this?

Thanks
Alex Gian
