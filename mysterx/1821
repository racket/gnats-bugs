windows (win32\i386) (get-display-depth) = 16

>Description:
I created a launcher and invoked it in rapid order twice.
One copy works as expected.  The second copy brings up a
window that is then unresponsive to all window ops.
>How-To-Repeat:
Config:
DrScheme 103 from Web page.
MysterX 103 patched, from Web page.
Windows 2000 Pro.
IE 5.0.

Program:
 (require-library "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")
 (define b (make-object mx-browser% "URL surfer"))
 (send b Navigate (send the-clipboard get-clipboard-string 0))
in MrEd non debug language level, made into a launcher.

I copy the URL 
  www.massacademy.org/ncsssmst
to the clipboard.  Then I double click on the launcher two
distinct times.

This brings up two "URL surfer" windows.  The first exits
immediately resulting in a stdout window saying the program
has exited.  (This is a virgin 103, recall.)  The second
brings up a "URL surfer" window that is "transparent" --
nothing shows up, it inherits the content of whatever is
placed atop it, the window's title bar is always in the
"active" color, and it doesn't respond to window ops.

I take that back.  Just now, after about five minutes,
the window *did* disappear.  I never did see it display
the URL's contents.

 Does the 2nd window behave OK after you close the stdout
 window?

 Shriram,

 Can you please test to see whether this bug persists 
 with the current (103-p3) MysterX release?
 
 Although I'm not able to reproduce the bug under NT4,
 I suspect it's gone now.

 Indeed, I could not get that behavior under NT.  But I have a guess 
 why you saw it.  There's a fix in 103-p3 (in 103-p2, also) that 
 addressed a slightly different problem, but may well alleviate the 
 problem you saw.  
 
 The change was to use Win32's GetMessage() (blocking) instead 
 of PeekMessage() (non-blocking).  I believe that PeekMessage()
 caused the first window to grab the CPU, so that the second 
 window was unable to service its Windows events.
