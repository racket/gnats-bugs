 There's no call to register-event-handler.  Could 
 that be the problem?

 I added a call to register the event handler just before
 the handle-events call.  On the VAIO, I just tried the 
 program 4 times, and it worked each time, using the 
 stock MzScheme 103 with MysterX 103.  With DrScheme 103,
 it works about 1/2 the time.  Even on the desktop, it's
 not reliable under DrScheme.
 
 I'll have to investigate more -- this may be tricky to pin
 down.

State-Changed-Why:
1st event doesn't always go from IE to MysterX
(the AtAnyEvent() C++ stub).  Not clear why this
happens under DrScheme.
