(require-library "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")

(make-object mx-document%
 	"From Macros to Reusable Generative Programming"
 	50 50 0 0 '(maximize))

under "try.ss".  In MrEd, type

(load "try.ss")

You get a maximized window.  Try the same in MzScheme.  You get a window
of size 50x50.  Close this window using Alt-Spc and type the load line
again.  This time the window that appears is maximized.

 With the current version of MysterX under NT4SP5, I get 
 a maximized window with both MrEd 100 and MzScheme 100.
