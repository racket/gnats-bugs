>Description:
Given a VB COM object with a property set method using a Date argument passed ByRef, attempting to set the property through (com-set-property! ... (box (date->com-date (find-seconds ...)))) fails to change the property though no error is thrown.  Querying the COM property afterward with com-get-property always yields Saturday, December 30th, 1899.  Other date properties that are passed ByVal work fine (for which no boxing is necessary.)  A sample VB Property definition for the COM side of this scenario is:

Private datTest As Date
Public Property Let testDate(ByRef d As Date)
  datTest = d
End Property
Public Property Get testDate() As Date
  testDate = datTest
End Property
>How-To-Repeat:
> (require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx"))
> (define test (cocreate-instance-from-progid "testProject.testClass"))
> (require (lib "date.ss"))
> (define d (date->com-date (seconds->date (find-seconds 0 0 0 28 8 2003))))
> (com-set-property! test "testDate" (box d))
> (date->string (com-date->date (com-get-property test "testDate")))
"Saturday, December 30th, 1899"
