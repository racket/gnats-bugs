        If you start up MzScheme and type (exit), it exits gracefully.
        If you start up MzScheme, load MysterX, then type (exit),
        nothing happens, and you need to futz with the cross-button
        at the top-right.
 
 I believe this problem is fixed, and probably was related to 
 reference-counting problems.  Actually, I've seen this problem
 under 98 *without* MysterX, on occasion.  Anyway, it's not occurring
 under NT.
 
 You might want to confirm this and other bug-fixes by downloading 
 the latest plt/collects/mysterx.  The .dll's have been compiled
 for 100.
