>Description:
I am requesting a small change in the interface to the
mx-browser$ interface. The browser should take an 
optional boolean argument. When given #t, the new
browser window should become visible. When given #f
the browser window should never show up. #f should be the 
default value.

 Shriram requested this one a while back.  Unfortunately,
 I couldn't find a way to do it.  The code which 
 puts the browser in the window seems to require a visible
 window.  I can try again, of course.
