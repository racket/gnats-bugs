mxmain.ss: you really want to load mxmain.dll

Same problem in Graphical (MrEd) language, so we can
rule out that (unlikely) cause.

 The error is exactly because you don't have the .DLL's.  The mxain.ss
 file is just a placeholder that never loads if you have the .DLL's.
 
 At some point, I can have the nightly script build those .DLL's, but it
 may be tricky, since there's no VC++ project for MysterX, just a
 Makefile.

 (1) A better error message would be nice.  A much better error message 
     would be even nicer!
 
 (2) What do I do now?  (This reminds me a bit about the jokes about
     the mathematicians whose responses are precise but unhelpful ...)
