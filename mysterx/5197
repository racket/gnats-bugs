>Description:
After extracting an Excel worksheet -- a #<com-object> --
I tried to get a range from it.  Following Paul's own
sample code, I tried

  (com-get-property ws "Range" "$B$1")

This produces the horribly confusing message,

  com-get-property (property "Range"): expects 3 to 4 arguments, given 2: #<com-object> "Range"

I'm stuck now.

 Right, that's a difference between 103 and 200 com-get-property.
 
 With 103, you could only extract one property at a time.
 
 With 200, you can specify a "path" of properties:
 
    (com-get-property obj prop1 prop2 prop3)
 
 which is sugar for
 
    (com-get-property 
      (com-get-property 
        (com-get-property obj prop1) 
        prop2)
      prop3)
 
 So in the call you gave, MysterX is considering "Range" as 
 a property, and the cell as another.  But the "Range" property 
 itself takes one or two arguments, and you gave none.
 
 So what you want is:
 
   (com-get-property ws '("Range" "$B$1"))
 	
 But actually, you did point me to a bug in the code -- it assumes
 there is at most one argument to a property.  I'll fix that.

 Okay, I got the basic functionality to work.  Thanks!
