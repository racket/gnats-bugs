When you install MysterX, you get two new
     directories in your PLT distribution:
     src/ and tests/.  In tests/mysterx/ is
     a Scheme file called mystests.  It seems
     reasonable to assume that this a demo.
     When you try to run this, however, you
     get the error
     
     ... well, you get an error.  So why
     is this file being distributed?

 Like the other files in plt/tests, those files are
 meant for testing, not as a demo.  We distribute 
 the other tests with source code bundles.  For MysterX,
 since we include source code, we include tests.
 
 The MysterX tests currently require that the source code be 
 compiled.  We could add a compiled version of the code to the
 distribution, but most users won't ever run it.

 Maybe I've misunderstood what you're saying, but I think many users
 tend to be adventurous, and when they find a source file for a product
 they may be having trouble getting used to, they have a tendency to
 try to use it to as a basis for what they want to write.  In fact, I
 know of virtually no programmers who don't work that way.  (This is,
 in fact, the whole basis for the HtUS book.)
 
 Therefore, *something* needs to happen to improve this situation.
 Maybe the directory could contain a README explaining how to run the
 program, and the file itself could begin with the comment
 
   ;; YOU CANNOT RUN THIS PROGRAM AS-IS.
   ;; To run this program, please consult the README and follow
   ;;  the instructions therein.
 
 If nothing else, it would be a sufficient deterrent.
