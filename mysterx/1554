>Description:
In MysterX, com-methods returns a list of 
method names that includes those inherited
from IDispatch.  Those methods aren't useful
in MysterX, so they should be filtered out.

Similarly, com-invoke should filter out attempts
to invoke such methods.
>How-To-Repeat:
(com-methods a-com-obj)
(com-invoke a-com-obj "Release")
