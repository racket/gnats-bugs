>Description:
If you run `com-help' on a COM object loaded 
into MysterX under MzScheme, the events generated 
by the Windows Help window may not be processed.

You can get around this by creating a MysterX browser, 
which has its own message pump.

>How-To-Repeat:
In MzScheme:

 (require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx"))
 (define xl (cci/progid "Excel.Application"))
 (com-help xl)

Try clicking on the Windows Help window.
