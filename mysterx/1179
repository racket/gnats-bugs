>Description:
Bring up an mx-document.  Click on the right button.  Go to the
Language entry and pick a different option.  This does not cause
an error when done in Internet Explorer, but in MysterX the
document goes black.  After closing the document, you get a
message in the REPL that reads

Error retrieving event, code = 80010012: The callee (server [not server applicat
ion]) is not available
and disappeared; all connections are invalid.  The call did not execute.

State-Changed-Why:

Problem is not easily fixable.  

The best solution would be to modify the context menu so that Language 
and some other choices are unavailable.  Unfortunately, obtaining the 
handle of the context menu is not a simple task.  In other words,
I couldn't figure out how to get it.

Another solution tried was to trap WM_CONTEXTMENU messages for 
the window procedure associated with the implicit IE server. 
This solution is not as good -- it just suppresses the context 
menu entirely.  But I couldn't get it to work reliably, anyway.
Since the IE server window is created implicitly by ATL, you
have to create a dummy instance of a MysterX document, retrieve its
window class, change the class's window procedure for use by
"real" MysterX documents ... but sometimes the change didn't seem 
to "stick".
