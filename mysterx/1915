 Fixed.  The bug fix that sped things up had the 
 unfortunate side effect of preventing window
 cleanup.
 
 If you'd like, I can issue a patch 3.

 For now, let's see what other feedback we get over the next week or so. 
 
 Otherwise I would like you to think about building a test suite that at 
 a minimum collects old bug reports and ensures that every release avoids
 those pitfalls. 
 
 Can you install IE4 and IE5 on the same machine?

 The issue to be tested is whether a Windows window exists or not.
 That's not currently observable from Scheme.  It could be made so
 through a new primitive.
 
 But here's the really tricky part.  The window is associated with 
 an mx-browser% object.  After you have shutdown the custodian 
 responsible for the browser, the browser object no longer exists, so 
 there's no access to its associated window.  You'd have to write 
 some low-level C code to get at the window.  That's probably more 
 trouble than manual testing.

 Then create an automatic test suite for what can be tested automatically
 and a list of things to be tested manually before release. Thanks
