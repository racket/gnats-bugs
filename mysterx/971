>Description:
I write an in-process ActiveX dll that encapsulates some common windows controls. Then I wish to Call a Function invoke (called method-invoke in docs) recognizes that it is a function, however, thinks that it should be called with one to few arguments. I think that it fails to count the First Argument. My function takes 2 args, a string and a boolen -- Mysterx complains that the function expects 3 args not 4, but in fact the function is written to expect 2 args, not 3. Then if I try to pass the FirstArg in only it complains that it is of the wrong type, so for this example it says:
(method "ShowBrowserWithURL"): expects type <P\237W> as 3rd argument given: "http://www.neodesic.com"; other arguements were: #<com-object> "ShowBrowserWithURL"

--Also, this holds true for Existing System COM objects, like Rich Text Box Controls.

Thanks In Advance - You guys kick ass

Jim
