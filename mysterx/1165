>Description:
Not a bug, but cannot use MysterX until it's fixed!

When attempting to install MysterX, 
all the appropriate files are unpacked and copied to the correct locations,
but the installation then dies claiming not to be able to find mysterx.dll.

I think this is because part of the path has been specified using forward
slashes, and Windows 98 cannot handle it.  I have not tried under NT yet.

The path that is reported as not found is the following:-
<c:\dev\plt\collects\mysterx\compiled/native/mysterx.dll>

maybe <c:\dev\plt\collects\mysterx\compiled\native\mysterx.dll> would cure this?

Thanks
Alex Gian

 Alex,
 
        When attempting to install MysterX, 
        all the appropriate files are unpacked and copied to the correct locations,
        but the installation then dies claiming not to be able to find mysterx.dll.
 
 Hmmm, we tested the .plt under both NT and 98 here.  
 
 Did the rest of the files get unpacked to c:\dev\plt\collects\mysterx,
 c:\dev\plt\src\mysterx, and c:\dev\plt\tests\mysterx? 
 
 Maybe try setting the environment variable PLTHOME to 
 C:\dev\plt.
 
 If you still have problems, I'll run some more tests here.

 I doubt there's a problem with the slashes.  Does the file
 plt\collects\mysterx\compiled\native\mysterx.dll exist?
 If all the files are there, then you should be able to run
 MysterX.
 
 Besides building .zo files, the info.ss file registers the
 COM servers myspage.dll and myssink.dll, located in the same
 directory as mysterx.dll.  You can do the registration by hand
 by running 
 
 	REGSVR32 myspage.dll
 
 and similarly for myssink.dll.  REGSVR32 is in the Windows system 
 directory.
 
 Without a mysterx.zo file, however, there is a problem you may 
 run into.  Since there is a mysterx.dll file, MzScheme considers
 it to be a compiled version of mysterx.ss, which it's not.
 If that problem occurs, the result is that the MysterX definitions you
 expect to have been created are not there.
 
 To avoid that problem, we've renamed mysterx.dll to mxmain.dll here
 for the 101 release. You might try doing the same.
 
 prims.ss in the mysterx collection now looks like:
 
 	(unit->unit/sig 
 	 (load-extension 
 	  (build-path (collection-path "mysterx") 
 		      "compiled" "native" "mxmain.dll"))
  ()
  mysterx:prims^)

 I recently had a similar problem with MFC .DLL's
 and certain applications.  I was at Service Pack 3,
 and upgraded to Service Pack 5.  That fixed the
 problem.  I believe that problem was due to 
 some application overwriting MFC .DLL's.
 
 Of course, it's puzzling that you're seeing problems
 on two machines.  That tends to suggest the 
 problem is not on the machines, but in the 
 MysterX .PLT.
 
 Perhaps the .PLT file is corrupted in some way?
 
 Anyway, see what happens with the manual installation
 procedure I suggested.

 Alex,
 
 	We're about to release DrScheme 101, and
 MysterX 101 will follow soon after.
 
 	Would you be willing to test the MysterX
 distribution when it's ready?  I expect it 
 to be available late this week, or early next
 week.
