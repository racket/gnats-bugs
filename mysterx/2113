>Description:
Using an exp-tagged version of the entire PLT Scheme source tree (downloaded 10/17/01), 
the following line will "Execute" once in the DrScheme GUI:

	(require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx"))

but when I Execute it a second time, I get the following error:

	require: unknown module in: |,f:\dev\lambda\plt-exp\collects\mysterx\private\mxmain|

I'm running this on Windows NT 4.0, and I built plt with MSVC 6.0.  I tried 
various language levels, including "R5RS" and "Textual (MzScheme)".

I don't know for sure that it's not some kind of build problem, but no errors 
were reported during the build.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run DrScheme.  Paste the following line into the Definitions window:

(require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx"))

Press Execute.  Press Execute a second time.  An error should be reported.

>Fix:
Changed behavior for scheme_reload().
