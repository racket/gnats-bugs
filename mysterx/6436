>Description:
It seems that the mysterx-205.plt package installs the MysterX DLL's in 

   $PLTHOME/collects/mysterx/precompiled/native/win32/i386

But under this configuration, requiring MysterX gives "mxmain.ss: you seem to be missing mxmain.dll; you need to build MysterX in plt\src\mysterx\".  But you don't!  Just moving the native folder from precompiled to compiled seems to fix the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Windows, run Setup PLT on mysterx-205.plt and require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")
