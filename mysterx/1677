>Description:
Evaluate: 

(require-library "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")

(define b (make-object mx-browser%))

(send b navigate "www.ice.edu")

A window pops up informing me that it can't find 
www.ice.edu and when I click okay the last expression
doesn't return. 

Try 

 (send b navigate "www.rice.edu/~matthais")

In that case it actually returns the string given 
as an argument. 
  
  (send b current-url)

also returns this string, even though the browser
window shows the Rice Cs error page.

 I'm running IE 5.5, and I get the same behavior.
 
 I believe that MS has pulled the rug out from under
 us by changing the semantics of the DocumentComplete2
 event. When that event occurs, an internal MysterX event 
 handler is passed the "actual URL", allowing the navigate method
 to return.  It used to be that a bad URL gave an 
 "actual URL" like "res://C:/WINNT/mumble ...", so it
 could be detected.  Now it appears that the "actual URL"
 is a canonicalized form of whatever URL you pass in.
 Bleah ...
 
 I'll have to look to see if there is some other way to
 detect a navigation failure.

 I've committed and exp-tagged a fix for this problem.
 You now get the actual URL reached by IE.
 
 You need to rebuild the MysterX sources and recompile the
 .zo's in the MysterX collection.

 What does this mean? I dont have cvs on my Windows machine. 
 I hardly ever use this thing. Can you just make a .plt for me? 
 Thanks.
