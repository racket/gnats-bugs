>Description:
When you register a COM event handler in MysterX with
profiling enabled in DrScheme, when the event occurs, 
you get an error message like:

 hash-table-get: expects type <hash-table> as 1st argument, 
  given: #f; other arguments were: profile-point27

MysterX stores event handlers (Scheme procedures) in a C++ 
table, and uses scheme_apply to call them when the 
event occurs.  I've verified that the error message 
is printed at the point of the scheme_apply.  The C++
code is in plt/src/mysterx/myssink/sink.cxx.

No problems occur if profiling is turned off.
No problems occur in MzScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set DrScheme to use profiling.

 Did you try this with errortrace profiling turned on? (that's nearly
 the same thing as drscheme's profiler).
