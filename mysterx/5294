>Description:
The file doc.txt in the mysterx folder suggests that there
is a method called "navigate" on mx-browser% objects, 
when in fact there is not. However, navigate/status works
fine.

Note that while I'm sending this from a 200a12 help desk,
the error occurred in version 200alpha12-cvs25feb2002, which
I've edited the synthesized info to reflect. The
help desk in that installation doesn't work at the moment 
(configuration?), so I'm using this one.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "mysterx.ss" "mysterx"))
> (define browser (make-object mx-browser%))
> (send browser navigate "www.plt-scheme.org")
. send: no such method: navigate for class: mx-browser%
(send browser navigate/status "www.plt-scheme.org")
("http://www.plt-scheme.org/" 200)
>Fix:
Two changes to plt/collects/mysterx.ss:

  (1) remove occurrence of "navigate" in show method
  (2) add navigate to list of public methods, just 
       before navigate-status
