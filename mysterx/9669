>Description:
Installing PLT Scheme on Windows doesn't register the two auxiliary DLLs needed for MysterX.  Without this, code that attempts to create an instance of mx-browser% will fail with the diagnostic "make-browser: Can't create browser window."  Subsequent attempts to create the object will hang DrScheme.

(The need to register these DLLs is mentioned in collects/mysterx/doc.txt.)

(Also, the standard mxdemo as cited in the doc, section 1.2, does force the registration of this, so folks who run that shouldn't encounter this.  I didn't run it because I lack the necessary calendar control.)
>How-To-Repeat:
On a system that has never hosted PLT Scheme, install via the NSIS installer.  Then open the registry editor and look for the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\myspage.DHTMLPage.  If the DLLs were in fact registered then this key will be present.

Without these DLLs present, the following sample code will fail when it attempts to instantiate mx-browser%.

#lang scheme
(require mzlib/class)
(require mysterx)
(define a (new mx-browser% (label "I am a test") (width 180) (height 350) (x 600) (y 300) (style-options '())))
(define b (send a current-document))
(send b insert-html "<H1>Test</H1>")
