 Technically, this is a bug in MysterX because MysterX allocates OS
 resources (in this case a window) but doesn't register it with the
 current-eventspace (this probably not explained as a requirement in the
 mzscheme manual anywhere, but you can see that it is a problem for
 DrScheme). It is possible to break mzscheme arbitrarily with extensions
 - -- this is just one of the many ways :)
