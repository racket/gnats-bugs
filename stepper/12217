>Description:
Stepper sometimes works (but mostly fails) when run on small programs with inexact values.

For example:

Running on a program like:
(define (c x)
  (* (- 1 (exp (* -2 x))) 1/2))
(c 7)

in Beginning Student sometimes gives the required 6 steps, but other times pops up a window and say:

sequence-contract-violation: negative: method set-position cannot be called, except in states (unlocked write-lock), args 3

 === context ===
/usr/lib/racket/collects/stepper/private/view-controller.rkt:260:2: update-view/existing
/usr/lib/racket/collects/stepper/private/view-controller.rkt:359:3
>How-To-Repeat:
Running on Ubuntu 11.04 with DrRacket v5.1.3.

Type in the program:
(define (c x)
  (* (- 1 (exp (* -2 x))) 1/2))
(c 7)

Try to step through.  If it works the first time, it probably will not work the second or third attempt of stepping.

 FWIW, this is probably because you're doing something that mutates the
 editor but not doing on the eventspace main thread of the frame that
 the editor is inside (which causes a race-condition).
 
 Let me know more details if that's not making sense (but sounds like
 it might be the issue).

 Okay, I think I've got a handle on how this could be happening.
 
 Just to confirm: it looks to me like the failing call that's actually =
 being reported is happening on the correct eventspace thread... but it =
 looks to me like it might be following (or racing with) a mutation to =
 the editor that's not happening on that thread.
 
 In fact, it looks like this is something that I made the effort to =
 protect with a semaphore, when (AFAICT) it would have been much simpler =
 just to do the edit in a queued callback.
 
 
 
 FWIW, I have not been able to reproduce this at all, but it appears to =
 me that it requires updating the view (by clicking the next button?) =
 very soon after the stepper starts, which could explain why I don't =
 observe it on my machine.
 
 I'm closing this bug in the commit message for the updated code, but =
 feel free to re-open it if it isn't fixed; since I can't reproduce it in =
 the first place, it's hard to be sure that I've fixed it.

 FWIW, I find that drdr is very good at exposing these kinds of bugs if
 you script things with the framework/test library. There are some
 helper functions in collects\tests\drracket\ for starting up a drraket
 and setting the language level. If you want to pursue this and are
 getting lost in the code, tell me what you want the automated clicking
 and clacking to do and I'll start something that you can add to.

 I think that one of us is misunderstanding the other one, and I think =
 the problem is that I wrote half the message before fixing the code, and =
 half after.  That is, I see how this could happen, and I believe that =
 push #23586 fixes it.
 
 Or did I misunderstand you?

 Good, I'm glad. I thought that you were saying that you weren't sure
 it was fixed. In any case, having drdr bang away on the stepper is
 probably a good idea regardless (but maybe it already is?)
