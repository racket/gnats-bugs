Although possilby considerd evil, a basic set of IDE Debugger view

definition frame, (ala codewarrior), displaying:

would be very helpfull in trying to debug/trace the execution
of most reasonably complex (and even simple) code sets.

 This is not an unreasonable request.  I hope to have a minimal 
 implementation for the full language later this summer.  It will 
 feature a REPL-based textual interface not unlike GDB. Initially, it 
 will probably only support pre-defined breakpoints.  That is, you 
 must specify all breakpoints before starting the program, and no 
 single-stepping is possible (unless you've placed enough breakpoints 
 in there yourself).
 
 Successive refinements will include:
 1) single-stepping
 2) single-stepping without performance penalty
 3) graphical interaction with DrScheme windows (e.g. zoom to this 
 source location in a DrS window)
 
 and maybe
 
 4) a GUI like you describe (this one comes later, and I see it as 
 less critical).
