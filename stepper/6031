>Description:
this program:

  (car)

doesn't produce the "done stepping" step, but this program:

  1

does. 

The latter program above actually has two steps
with the message, not just one (does that make
the first one mistaken? ;)

The "evaluation of program is complete." message
is editable.

The "evaluation of program is complete." is a little
bit ugly. Perhaps it should be a bigger font or
centered or something other than a sentence 
ungramatical sentence fragement (with a period, even).

I have mentioned some of this in other email, but
not all of it and not in a PR before.
