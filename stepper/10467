When stepping a cond expression in BSL, all identical
subexpressions in the question part of a cond are
highlighted as the subexpression to reduce,
rather than just the first occurrence.

Step through the following.  Notice that
both (= 1 1) are highlighted.

(cond [(= 1 1) 'ok]
      [(= 1 1) 'ok])

 Nice one!  That's related to 'confusability', and could be an easy fix.
