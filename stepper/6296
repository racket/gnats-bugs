>Description:
When I am using the Standard Scheme Language (R5RS),
I cannot using the stepper to help me debug my programs.
It tells me that it is only available to users in the
beginner levels. Although this is probably intentional
on your part, it would still be very useful if you were
to allow users to use the stepper in any version that you
provide. Since you have already created it, why do you
not let users use it? Please consider making the stepper
available for all users, it would be a great conveinance
and a pleasure for us all! Thank you :)
