I assume this is a configuration issue but have spent quite some time trying to discover the correct configuration for the Step button to support functions and have been unsuccessful.

 What you're seeing is clearly a bug, but I haven't been able to =
 reproduce it.
 
 Does this error occur when you clear the teachpacks and revert to the =
 language defaults?

 No.
 With language defaults selected the bug disappears.
 
 It appears the "enable tracing" option on the language "details" page 
 should be disabled in language options where tracing
 is not supported.
