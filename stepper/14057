 A shorter program that causes the problem:
 
 (require 2htdp/universe)
 
 (define (f w) w)
 
 (big-bang (f 10)=20
           [to-draw add1])
 
 It appears that the problem occurs when a user-defined procedure is =
 called in the "initial world" position of big-bang. This is presumably =
 because big-bang is a macro, and so is a call to a user-defined =
 procedure.
 
 This suggests a workaround, which is to define the world separately, =
 before using it in the initial-world position.  That's obviously grossly =
 unsatisfying, but it does appear to "work". =20
 
 I'll take a look and see if I can actually fix the bug.
 
 Best,
 
 John Clements

 Yes, I see the problem.  The issue is that the stepper labels the big-bang form as "skip-this-completely", which isn't the right thing to do when terms in the big-bang expression require evaluation.  It would be easy to hack around, a bit more work to fix correctly.
 
 Thinking about how to fix it....
