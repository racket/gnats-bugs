>Description:
I'm trying to demonstrate the use of the stepper using step-within.  The stepper shows a step that terminates with the term

(check-within
 #i369.9944227116344
 184997/500
 1/1000)

however, the next step does *not* show the reduction of the term to `true`.  Instead that reduction is skipped and the stepper moves onto the reduction of the next `check-within`.  Source file attached below.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; tesla-measures : number of seconds -> frequency
;; purpose: to say what Tesla measures at what time (overture)
(define (tesla-measures t)
  (* 440 (expt 2 (/ (- t 4.5) 6))))
;; examples
(check-within (tesla-measures 0) 261.626 0.001)
(check-within (tesla-measures 3) 369.994 0.001)
(check-within (tesla-measures 5) 466.164 0.001)

; alternative numeric formula is not as accurate
(define (tesla-numeric t)
  (* 261.625 (expt 1.05946 (* 2 t))))
(check-within (tesla-numeric 0) 261.626 0.01)
(check-within (tesla-numeric 3) 369.994 0.01)
(check-within (tesla-numeric 5) 466.164 0.05)

 Yep... I haven't spent the time it would take to dress up the check-within to pretend to be an application-like form.
 
 Mea culpa.
