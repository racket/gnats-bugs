 As we discussed yesterday with Robby, the execution of a program 
 triggered by the 'Execute' button is currently entirely unrelated to 
 the execution of a program triggered by the 'Step' button.  If I 
 understand you correctly, you would like the execution of the program 
 by the 'Execute' button to halt when the user clicks on the 'step' 
 button (and vice versa?). This sounds like a complex interaction 
 between tools that can otherwise be unrelated.
 
 Robby? Do you have any comment on this?

 Robby has convinced me that this is inappropriate
 because we don't want to think of the two executions
 as related.

 Well, my argument is that if they are going to be related, they should
 be in the same frame, but we don't want to do that (too much work).
