>Description:
In the Intermediate language, when local bindings are promoted to the top level, the "new" name given to the local binding is not necessarily unique.  An example is given in the code below.  (I am teaching Scheme in CS 135 at the University of Waterloo this term.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Step through the following program:
(define s_0 13)
(define (f a)
  (local 
    [(define s 2)]
    (+ a s s_0)))
(f 3)

Notice that "s" is changed to "s_0" in the top environment, even though s_0 exists in the top environment.  It would be better to actually use a random suffix (say "s_314390" or whatever (random 1000000) would generate).  That would make this topic a bit easier for students to understand.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by clements at Wed, 12 Dec 2018 18:05:51 -0500
Reason>>> fixed in racket/htdp commit #60ff811f6de1ebf5a3ac2e1
