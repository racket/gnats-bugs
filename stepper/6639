 I can't duplicate this.  Can you give me any more hints on how to make 
 it happen? Does it happen every time?
 
 In the meantime, I'll have a quick look at the code to see how this 
 might arise.

 No clue! It doesn't happen now, actually.

 Did the fix involve disabling the button until it can be clicked?
 
 I ask because the automatic GUI test suite has to have some way to know
 when it should start clicking the button (well, I suppose it could poll
 the button for 10 seconds or something, but I'd aim that's not the best
 UI design :).

 Yes; the test for whether the button should be enabled had a "=" 
 instead of a ">=".
