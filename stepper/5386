 If you swap the two definitions, the stepper works just fine.

 Fixed, committed, exp-tagged, added to test suite.
 
 Part of the problem here was that the test did not match the model in 
 that it reconstructed all expressions after they had all been 
 evaluated, rather than as each one was completed.
 
 Thanks for helping me debug.
