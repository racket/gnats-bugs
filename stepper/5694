 It seems that this didn't get fixed yet? I guess this test isn't in
 John's test suite?
 
 This seems important to the release.
 
 I will have a look at it.

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    I've fixed, committed, and tagged stepper-tool.ss.
    The revisions are in version 1.22. 
    
    You may want to take a look at them.
    
    It's not clear the stepper should even be doing that, but
    I did it this way for v201.
