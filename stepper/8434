; 
; Exercise 10.2.8.   Adapt the function recall from exercise 10.1.7 for the new data definition of inventory. 
;          The function consumes the name of a toy ty and an inventory and
;          produces an inventory that contains all items of the input with the exception of those labeled ty.
;          
; Data Analysis and Definitions:
; 
; An Inventory is a list made up of inventory records
; inventory records are structures
; 
; Structure Definition:

(define-struct ir (name price pic))

; 
; Data Definitions:
;      
;      An inventory-record is a structure:
;      (make-ir s n p)
;      Where s is a symbol
;      n is a positive number
;      p is a picture
; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;     
;      And inventory is either
;      empty
;      or
;      constructed
;      If Constructed it has a first which is an inventory-record
;      and a rest which is an inventory
;      
; Examples:


(define invOne (cons (make-ir 'doll 17.95 .)
  empty))

(define invTwo (cons (make-ir 'robot 22.05 .)
  (cons (make-ir 'doll 17.95 .)
    empty)))
; 
; Contract:
; recall: symbol inventory -> inventory
; 
; Purpose:
; recall consumes a toy name and an inventory of a store and produces an inventory with all of the named toys removed
; 
; Header:

; 
; (define
;   (recall aToy anInventory)
;   empty
;   )
; 
; ;;;      Examples:
; 
; emptyShould be(recall 'doll invOne)Test...
; (cons (make-ir 'doll 17.95 .) empty)Should be(recall 'robot invTwo)Test...
; (cons (make-ir 'robot 23.1525 .)
;   (cons (make-ir 'doll 18.8475 .)
;     empty))Should be(recall  'beebeegun invTwo)Test...
; Should Raise(recall 'awdgsgjtdsdrg 'invTwo)Test...
; 
; Template:
; 
; (define
;   (recall aToy anInventory)
;   (cond
;     [(empty? anInventory) ...]
;     [(cons? anInventory) ...
;           ...(first anInventory)...
;              ...(ir-name (first anInventory))...
;              ...(ir-price (first anInventory))...
;              ...(ir-pic (first anInventory))...
;           ...(rest anInventory)...
;              ...(recall (rest anInventory))...]
;     [else (error 'recall "recall can't play with your bad data")]
;     )
;   )
; 
; Design:
; If its empty, return empty
; If its constructed, then check
;      If the ir-name of the first is the same as a toy, then do recall of the rest
;      else make a list where the first is the first of the list and the rest is the recalled rest of the list
; Else error out
; 
; Definition:


(define
  (recall aToy anInventory)
  (cond
    [(empty? anInventory) empty]
    [(cons? anInventory)
     (cond
       [(symbol=? (ir-name (first anInventory)) aToy) (recall aToy (rest anInventory))]
       [else (cons (first anInventory) (recall aToy (rest anInventory)))]
       )]
    [else (error 'recall "recall can't play with your bad data")]
    )
  )

;;;      Tests:

emptyShould be(recall 'doll invOne)Test...
Actual(cons (make-ir 'doll 17.95 .) empty)Should be(recall 'robot invTwo)Test...
Actual(cons (make-ir 'robot 23.1525 .)

 I've tried to reproduce your problem, and you'll have to help me a  
 bit.  For instance, when I try to evaluate your code, I get this error:
 
 read: illegal use of "."
 
 ... BOTH when I click on run and when I click on step.
 
 The expression that's highlighted is this one, from your program:
 >
 ...
 > (define invOne (cons (make-ir 'doll 17.95 .)
 >   empty))
 
 Did your program have a dot by itself like this?  I suspect some kind  
 of copy/paste problem in this bug report.
 
 For the heck of it, I tried replacing the dots with numbers, and it  
 turned out that the test case code was not well-formatted either.
 
 
 I'm afraid I can't help you without more information from you.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John Clements
