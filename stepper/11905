>Description:
Using the Intermediate HTDP language in DrRacket and trying to step through this code:

(define (f x)
  (local ((define-struct a (b c)))
    x))

(f 1)

gives the error:

annotate-inner: nothing expands into begin! : (list 'begin (list '#%app 'set-signature-arbitrary! 'sig (list '#%app 'apply 'arbitrary-record 'make-a (list '#%app 'list 'a-b 'a-c) 'arbs)))
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open DrRacket
2. Paste

(define (f x)
  (local ((define-struct a (b c)))
    x))

(f 1)

into the the code box.

3. Push the "Step" button.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "sw-bug" to "change-request" by clements at Tue, 10 May 2011 13:47:50 -0400
Reason>>> The stepper doesn't currently handle local structure defs.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "clements" by clements at Tue, 10 May 2011 13:47:50 -0400
Reason>>> It's a stepper issue.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by clements at Tue, 10 May 2011 13:47:50 -0400
Reason>>> Yep, this is a known issue.  Local structure definitions got
added to intermediate "under the radar".
