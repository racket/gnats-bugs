>Description:
Hitting "Continue" in the DrScheme backtrace after a user break 
seems to always cause this DrScheme internal error:

"continuation application: attempt to jump into an escape continuation"

>How-To-Repeat:
In a new DrScheme window,
> (define (loop) (loop))
> (loop)

While running, hit break, then hit the bug icon. When backtrace
appears, hit the Continue button. The DrScheme internal error
message appears.

 Maybe it's a leftover from the pre-204 prototype debugger?
