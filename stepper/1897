>Description:
The stepper doesn't show what's being reduced until the
reduction is finished.  For a teachpack that takes a long time
to reduce an added primitive it looks like the steper's stuck.
(For example, it's waiting for a network connection from a browser.)
If it could show what's being reduced in the mean time that would
help.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Load the cgi teachpack.  Step through a program.
