>Description:
Under certain conditions, the application-forward and -backward buttons in the stepper don't function as expected: they're not completely inverses of each other.  (Perhaps this is the intended behavior?)
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter following text in defns window:

========================================================
(define (format-unit quant unit)
  (string-append (number->string quant)
                 " "
                 (symbol->string unit)))

(define (add-units quant1 quant2 unit)
  (string-append (format-unit quant1 unit)
                 " + "
                 (format-unit quant2 unit)
                 " = "
                 (format-unit (+ quant1 quant2) unit)))

(add-units 3 4 'pounds)
=======================================================

Hit [Step] button.

Hit [Application >|] button 4 times; stepper says that all applications have finished.  Now, hit [|< Application], and you roll back the last call to format-unit, as expected.  Finally, hit [Application >|]: nothing happens, except that the [Application >|] button becomes greyed out.

I'd expect the last click on the [Application >|] button to go back to the "all applications completed" screen.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "clements" by clements at Mon, 18 Sep 2006 17:19:17 -0400
Reason>>> stepper bug

State changed from "open" to "closed" by clements at Mon, 18 Sep 2006 17:19:17 -0400
Reason>>> fixed the bug; missing hyphen.  Enum types (r6rs) would have caught this 
problem.
