Responsible-Changed-When: Tue Aug 20 21:06:53 2002
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    stepper
State-Changed-From-To: open->analyzed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 20 21:06:53 2002
State-Changed-Why:
    Temp hack: the stepper assumes case sensitivity
    when printing code.
    
    As far as I can tell, the Stepper needs more help from
    the tool interface to know how to print code. I may have
    missed something, though.
State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by clements at Sun, 13 Sep 2009 18:06:20 -0400
Reason>>> Bug no longer reproducible, thanks to underlying changes in Dr/MzScheme
