>Description:
Teachpack:
 servlet.ss
 ~matthias/Unison/Serlvlet/teachpack.ss

Program: 
; String String String -> true
(define (good-bye name password place)
  (cond
    [(string=? password "good word") (final-page name)]
    [else (final-page "fine")]))
                 
;; RUN: 
(good-bye
 (single-web-query "What is your name?")
 (single-web-query "What is your password: " "password")
 (single-web-query "Where do you live? "))

Execute, fill out two forms, click back twice, put new
name in, fill out two forms, things work out as expected. 

Now step through this same sequence and get the following
reaction for the step from 2 to 3: 

(good-bye
  "matthias"
  "good word"
  (single-web-query
    "Where do you live? ")).
=>
(good-bye
  "matthias"
  "good word"
  "manuel")

In other words, the new name is inserted as the "where do
you live answer" rather than the new name. 


>How-To-Repeat:
I am afraid that the fix could lead to a new paper on 
reduction semantics.

 As we discussed, this is a problem with using the store to hold part 
 of the stepper's information about the continuation.  We have a nice 
 proof that the evaluation context and the continuation marks stay in 
 sync, but of course this doesn't apply to the store.  In a larger 
 context, this is a problem with premature (incorrect) optimization. 
 The solution is to stop mutating the store to maintain information 
 about the continuation.
