>Description:
This program, in the beginner language:

  3.1415926535

produces a fancy compound fraction when executed,
but whne stepping it produces this:

  6283185307/2000000000

It should produce the same decimal, since decimals
are read as exact numbers in the teaching languages

DrScheme, before it had compound fractions also
used to produce this decimal.

In fact, when you flip the "print rationals in whole/part
notation" switch in the language configuration dialog,
DrScheme produces the decimal version and the stepper
still produces the funny fraction.

This PR is only about the printing format. Another PR will
follow about the funny 7 at the end of the fraction.
