>Description:
The HtDP Intermediate w/Lambda stepper lifts local definitions to the toplevel, and renames them to avoid name clashes. Unfortunately, it doesn't check if its names are already defined at the top-level, and so it can produce output like this:

Step 1: 
(define x_0 4)
(local ((define x 5)) x)

Step 2:
(define x_0 4)
(define x_0 5)
x_0

Step 3:
(define x_0 4)
(define x_0 5)
5

Step 4:
(define x_0 4)
(define x_0 5)
5
x_0

Step 5:
(define x_0 4)
(define x_0 5)
5
4

The results are all correct, but if Step 4 were typed into the top-level, it would either produce a duplicate-definition error (in HtDP), or the final x_0 would evaluate to 5 (in a language that allowed duplicate definitions).

It seems like the best thing to do here would be to check if an identifier is in use, and if so, don't rename something else to it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following into HtDP Intermediate w/Lambda:

(define x_0 4)
(local ((define x 5)) x)
x_0

Use the Stepper to step through it.
