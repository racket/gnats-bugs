>Description:
As the displayed Steps in The Stepper extend beyond the bottom of the window for longer programs, clicking the Step >| button causes the next step to appear below the viewable window.  This means you need to scroll down to see that new Step, click Step >| to generate the next Step, scroll down again to see that step, etc.  It would be nice to have it so that the window was always scrolled down as low as the most recent Step so you do not have to move the mouse to/from the Step >| button when trying to quickly step through a lengthy program.

 Thanks for your report. I believe this problem is fixed in an upcoming release of DrRacket. If you want to take a look, you can download a pre-release from 
 
 https://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/
 
 I’m going to optimistically close this bug report, but please feel free to re-open it or file another one if you find that the problem isn’t solved.
 
 Thanks!

 Thanks John!
 
 Following your link I updated to Racket v7.0.0.20 via Northwestern
 University's link to the Windows 64-bit version of "Racket plus Tests" (
 https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/snapshots/current/installers/racket-test-=
 7.0.0.20-x86_64-win32.exe)
 and
 it seems to be working as expected.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Michael
