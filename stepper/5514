>Description:
Is it a problem that the version of DrScheme that I am 
running (200alpha19) does not have a Step button above the
definitions window, but "How To Design Programs" (e.g.,
Section 2.1) does?

(Note: I did try to submit this via the Help Desk in DrScheme, but
an error occurred when I tried to submit it.)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open up version 200alpha19 of DrScheme.
2. Open up Section 2.1 of "How to Design Programs"
