>Description:
Gentlemen,

First off, many thanks for adding a drop-down to the Stepper for skipping to the selected expression.  Is there a way to modify the stepper so that it could retain only the steps beginning at a selected position?  I've been watching the stepper wind through a student's tests for over 3 minutes now, and it'd be nice if it didn't have to step slowly through the tests he doesn't care about (esp. when he's doing exactly what I ask in being diligent about writing test cases).
>How-To-Repeat:
Step any file with a large number (say, 30+) of check-expects.

 Hi John,
 
 Yep, that's it -- sorry if I wasn't clear on it.  In today's instance  
 the student had enough tests that he was waiting until the step  
 counter got up to somewhere around "n/1500" for some high n (which  
 took 3 or 4 minutes on his recent Powerbook -- and the code was non- 
 graphical and had no inf loops or large input data, just about 70  
 tests) before he gave up and decided just to spend his time  
 scrutinizing the code instead.  So my request is about speeding up the  
 process of skipping to the selection.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jordan
