>Description:
The stepper seems to have a race condition. 

step thru this program:

  (define (f x) (f x)) (f 1)

but click the next button very quickly
(I am not able to reproduce this with
 the builtin mouse on my laptop, the
 button doesn't go quickly enough)

I get this error, eventually:

    lookup-binding: variable not found in environment: #<syntax>
