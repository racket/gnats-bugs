>Description:
I'm not sure whether it's the "back" button, with
fractions, or neither, but something goes wrong with
the combination. It looks like a missing `end-edit-sequence'.

>How-To-Repeat:
Enter this program in the defns window:
 (+ (/ 1 3) 5)
Click Step
Take two steps forward
One step back
Change the decimal to a fraction (right-click on the number)
  => stepper window doesn't update correctly

 Goodness, I had no idea you could right-click on a fraction.  Well, 
 it's not surprising I didn't test that.
