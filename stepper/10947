>Description:
The stepper does not work when using "Determine language from source". For example, when trying to step any program written in #lang htdp/bsl, the following error appears in the stepper window:

compile: unbound identifier (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) at: list in: (list 3)
>How-To-Repeat:
Set language to "Determine language from source" and set the #lang language to be htdp/bsl and press the stepper button with any program.
>Fix:
