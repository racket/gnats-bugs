I can't find in the manual any ideas of what to do to make the stepper actually show me the steps.  I am in "beginning" language level and trying several different programs including the (distance-to-0 (make-posn 3 4)) which evaluates to 5, as it should, but in the stepper won't show me any steps.
>How-To-Repeat:
I click the "stepper" button, the program appears, I click "Next", and it says it's done.

 I don't have quite enough information from you to diagnose your 
 problem, but I'm going to guess anyway.  My guess is that you have a 
 definition for the distance-to-0 function in your definitions window, 
 and when you say that (distance-to-0 (make-posn 3 4)) evaluates to 5, 
 you mean that you're typing this in the interactions window after 
 clicking execute.  Is this correct?
 
 If so, the problem is that the stepper only evaluates the expressions 
 in the definitions window.  So, if you want to step through, say, 
 (distance-to-0 (make-posn 3 4)), you should put this in the definitions 
 window, after the definition of the distance-to-0 function.
 
 Also, you might also want to look at the Stepper's documentation.  Just 
 search for "stepper" in Help Desk.  From that documentation:
 
 "Please note that the stepper only steps through the expressions
 in the definitions window, and does not allow the user to enter
 additional expressions.  So, for instance, a definitions buffer
 which contains only procedure definitions will not result in
 any reductions."
 
 Of course, if this is not your problem at all, please give me more 
 detail, so that I can help you out.
 
 In fact, please reply in any case, so that I can close the bug report 
 if this solves your problem.
 
 Hope this helps,
