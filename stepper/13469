 Yes it was probably my fault. I will take a look.

 Okay, the problem here is in code in the stepper that discards steps for wh=
 ich the lhs =3D rhs (as in this case). Stephen, it looks to me like you add=
 ed this code, on or near line 302 of stepper/private/<a href=3D"http://mode=
 l.rs" target=3D"_blank">model.rs</a>.<br>
 
 <br>
 I think if I tried to fix this I would probably break all of your lazy step=
 per stuff. Do you have an opinion on this?<br>
