 I tracked the problem down to change in collects/private/teach.ss that
 was probably intented for a newer (not-exp-tagged) version of the
 stepper.
 
 I reverted the change and exp-tagged. See version 1.64 versus 1.63 in
 CVS.

 I've improved drscheme's stepper test suite so that it would detect
 this bug in the future. If you have time, I would appreciate you having
 a look at: plt/collects/tests/drscheme/stepper-test.ss and adding in
 any tests that come to mind.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Well, it looks like this bug isn't completely fixed. Since it seemed
 like it wasn't being covered in any test suite, I went ahead and added
 test cases to drscheme's stepper test suite (now checked in) to test
 for this and other things. It turns out that this program:
 
 
   (define x 1)
   (+ x x)
 
 also turns into define-values in the exp-tagged stepper (as of right
 now -- I just re-ran cvs update and got nothing new).

 Thanks for reporting this.  I will run the full stepper test suite now. 
   For future reference, the test suite is called "through-tests.ss", in 
 plt/tests/stepper.  I'm relatively confident that this test is subsumed 
 by one in the suite.

 P.S.: If you're describing what I think you are when you say 'stepper 
 test suite' (that is, the graphical one that opens windows and 'clicks 
 and clacks', I think that this test does not belong here.  The 
 graphical suite is _crushingly_ slow on my machine, and through-tests 
 is relatively snappy (I said relatively).  So I think that the only 
 tests in the graphical test suite should relate to opening and closing 
 windows, clicking on the buttons, resizing, etc.

 Yes, through-tests.ss turns up heaps of define-values errors.  I will 
 fix these after I return from Harvard this afternoon.

 Ok, I undid nearly all of the other changes in lang.ss (except the
 internal-define changes that I added).
 
 There's still a change in teachhelp.ss which looks like a different
 kind of change to me, but should that one be reversed as well?
 
 The currently exp-tagged code seems to pass the "through-test.ss" suite
 as well as it passed in v204. The failure in both v205 and v204 has to
 do with the servlet2.ss teachpack. Anyone know whether that's expected?

 I also noticed that this program:
 
   (+ #1.1 1)
 
 still steps wrong. It shows up as:
 
   (+ 1.1 1)
   2.1
 
 rather than:
 
   (+ #i1.1 1)
   #i2.1
 
 Can this program be tested with your test suite, John?
 
 This is not a release-critical item.

 Not reliably.  Currently, the test suite fakes the part of the chain 
 that consists of the language-specific printing settings, so I see this 
 as an excellent test for the gui test suite.
 
 FWIW, the bug you mention is listed in the OPENBUGS file.  Fixing it 
 involves (AFAICT) shuffling the output generation around (as you've 
 suggested earlier) to thread the creation of the output expression 
 through the actual printing of that expression.
