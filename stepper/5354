>Description:
Hello, I've installed and am very happily using the latest DrScheme.
The thing is though I don't have a stepper anymore as I did with plt103.
Has it been removed or is this a bug?
Thanks

 The stepper is not included with 200 alpha 12.  It will be included 
 with the final release of version 200.
