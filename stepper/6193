>Description:
I'm working along in the interactions window (module language), manually stepping through
some code.  Then, I type
  (set! progeram final-prog)
Of course, `progeram' is a typo; that identifier is not currently bound.

Instead of just printing an error message, though, the interactions window hangs.  All buttons
except Break are grayed out; hitting Break produces a beep but no other behavior.  DrScheme's menus
are still active, however.  I quit DrScheme and went to restart; I found the following in the terminal
from which I'd started DrScheme:

  error trying to display error: exception raised: reference to undefined identifier: progeram

>How-To-Repeat:
With an empty definitions window, set the language to module and hit Execute.  In the 
interactions window, type
  (set! progeram 3)
and hit enter.

(Apologies if this is a duplicate bug, but plt-scheme.org seems to be having problems right now,
so I can't check existing bug reports.)

 and this is the error he got:

 This is a bug in the new errortrace.ss:
 
   Welcome to MzScheme version 203.6, Copyright (c) 1995-2003 PLT
   > (require (lib "errortrace.ss" "errortrace"))
   > (set! x 1)
   error trying to display error: exception raised: reference to undefined identifier: x
   Exit 1
 
 Do we have a test suite for the new errortrace?

 The old test mechanism was to load errortrace and then run the MzScheme
 test suite.
 
 Running the MzScheme test suite this way finds the same bug (at line
 265 of the "syntax.ss" test file).

 Is the profiler tested in this manner too?

 Yes, once upon a time. (Looks like the profiler is completely broken
 right now.)
