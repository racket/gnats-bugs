>Description:
In BSL or ISL+lambda, requiring rackunit makes the stepper emit strange messages when it gets to check-equal?
>How-To-Repeat:
Consider the following file:

(require rackunit)

(define (add-two x)
  (+ x 2))
(add-two 1)

(check-equal? 3 (add-two 1))

In BSL, or ISL+lambda, this runs fine.  The stepper works fine until it reaches the check-equal?, when it says:

compile: cannot use identifier tainted by macro transformation


Under some circumstances, which I haven't been able to reproduce reliably, the stepper gives an immediate:

annotate: unexpected syntax for expression: (list '#%variable-reference)

I have not tried all the student languages.

If I use #lang racket, the debugger works fine, but this is not available in the student languages.

 The stepper does complete rewriting of source, thus "breaking all the =
 rules." When we changed to the taint system, Matthew kindly went through =
 and updated things for me.  My guess is that I can fix this by waving a =
 somewhat more powerful untainting wand in the right place. =20
 
 ... okay, I'm back from the syntax-protect docs.  My suspicion =
 here--unconfirmed--is that rackunit arms its macros with a dye-pack =
 whose inspector is not super-ed by the stepper's.=20
 
 I'm confident that this bug can be fixed :).
