 Works like a charm for me. 
 
 For example: 
 
 
 (define (f x) x)
 
 (check-expect (f 10) 9)
 
 
 Please send a two-liner that doesn't work.

 Sorry, my bad. The problem is with check-equal?, not with check-expect. Try the Stepper on:
 
 (require rackunit)
 (require rackunit/text-ui)
 
 (define (f x) x)
 
 (check-equal? (f 10) 9)
 
 It gives a "compile: cannot use identifier tainted by macro transformation".
 
 Best,

 Thank you. Mitch already pointed out the inconsistency of check-equal? and *SL. 
 
 As you probably know, *SL comes with its own unit test suite, with more support for language levels. Use check-expect when you wish to demo stepping for broken test cases. A switch should work w/o much problem.

 No, this is not a duplicate of 12206.  That bug was about rackunit, this =
 one is about check-expect.  This one looks like not-a-bug to me, but =
 we're waiting on a response from the submitter.

 The response is in, which is why Sam called it a duplicate.
