>Description:
When the stepper is evaluating the rhs of a defn, the
definitions following that one just appear in the
stepper window, instead of being in the "fourth pane"
>How-To-Repeat:
step through this program:

(local ((define f (+ 1 2))
        (define g (+ 3 4)))
  (+ f g))

(define f (+ 1 2))

I would expect that the definition of `f' should be inthe
bottom pane, but it doesn't show up there until all stepping
is done.
