>Description:
The stepper's printing doesn't seem to be tied to
the current language. For example, (/ 1 10)
produces 1/10 by default instead of 0.1. More
seriously, (list 1 2 3) produces `(1 2 3), but
backquote (and quote) is disallowed in Beginning Student.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put
  (/ 1 10)
  (list 1 2 3)
in the defn window and step.
