>Description:
DrScheme contains snips that students can copy and paste into their definitions buffers. Some of these snips do not have snip-classes with "(lib ...)" classnames for on-demand loading. When students submit files containing such snips to a handin-server instance, the server fails to read the file and rejects the submission.

Perhaps the handin-server should have address this problem itself, mapping all unknown snip-classes to some trivial snip-class. I don't see any mechanism for implementing that besides catching the read error, parsing the message (!) to get the snip-class name, installing a new mapping, and retrying the read.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is one example:

The Stepper uses a snip with snip-class "drscheme:vertical-separator-snip%". A student can copy the stepper display (using Select All, then Copy from the menu), then paste the result into the definitions window.

In this case I'm not sure if the right answer is to disable Select and Copy or to change the snip-class name to have a "(lib ...)" form for on-demand loading.

I'm also not sure if this is the only snip-class used by DrScheme that has this problem. It's just the only one I've run into so far.

 IMO, the right solution is to change the snip.

 This isn't a drscheme problem or a mred problem. it is a problem with  
 either the handin server or with the stepper.

 Actually, I don't see what the handin server can do to solve the
 problem.  It does have code to convert a media file to text, and in
 that code I have a few hacks that convert some snips, but that will
 never be a good solution.
 
 I'll pass the torch to John now.

 The handin server could be a little more robust with those things. I  
 suspect there is a hack to make things work in the lucky case that  
 snip is in a comment or similar (or does that already work?).
 
 Matthew?

 Ryan is the one who is dealing with snips etc.

 I believe I've fixed this problem, by copying the approach of  
 drscheme/private/number-snip.ss.
 
 In particular, I can copy one of these arrows, save the file, and re- 
 open it successfully.  I'm not confident that this proves that the  
 bug is fixed.  I would like someone else (Eli? Ryan?) to confirm that  
 I've fixed this bug.
 
 Perhaps equally important is this:  in order to make it possible to  
 copy this snip, I had to manually edit the stepper's definition to  
 comment out all the (lock #t) calls.  The bug report suggests,  
 however, that--on some platforms--it's possible to copy this by  
 default.  Ryan, on what platform is this possible... windows?  I  
 tried Mac OS X and X windows, and in neither one was it possible to  
 copy the snip without disabling the (lock #t) calls.
 
 Hmm....
 
 Anyhow, it's all committed, and if someone can confirm that the bug  
 is fixed, I'll close it.
