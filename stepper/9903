>Description:
Running this code in the stepper:

(define (total1 alon)
  (cond 
    [(empty? alon) empty]
    [else (cons (first alon)
                (add-to-each (first alon)
                             (total1 (rest alon))))]))
(define (add-to-each m alon)
  (cond
    [(empty? alon) alon]
    [else (cons (+ m (first alon)) (add-to-each m (rest alon)))]))
(total1 (list 1 2 3))

gives the following error after 8 steps:

expr-iterator: unknown expr: (if true (#%app cons (#%app + m (#%app first alon)) (#%app add-to-each m (#%app rest alon))))

while running the code gives the correct answer (list 1 3 6)

Thanks.
