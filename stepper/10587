>Description:
Run the stepper on a small program such as 

(define (! n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (! (- n 1)))))
(! 0)

When you click 'step', the stepper window pops open 
and you see a blank space. Then you notice that something
in the upper right is changing which stops with #f/4 showing 
up. The window is still blank. 

You somehow need to get the idea of clicking a button. 

Don't click the left arrow though! You will see an internal 
error. Click Step or Application. 

I think we need to do better than that! Indeed, unless this 
is a huge change to the code base I'd like this propagated
to the release branch. 

(Sorry I noticed the bug a while ago but I failed to report it.)

 Yikes! I'll set aside some time for this today.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "clements" by clements at Wed, 18 Nov 2009 13:59:06 -0500
Reason>>> stepper bug

State changed from "open" to "closed" by clements at Wed, 18 Nov 2009 13:59:06 -0500
Reason>>> added a first-step semaphore so it gets displayed when it shows up, and the 
buttons are disabled prior to its arrival
