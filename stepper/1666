>Description:
When running the stepper, clicking the "step" button doesn't 
restart the evaluation (unlike "execute"). This can be frustrating
when testing out a program. Imagine these steps:
1) write a program
2) start stepping
3) find a bug.
4) fix the bug.
5) start stepping
6) see the same bug you just fixed.
