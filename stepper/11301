>Description:
I have a file ps04-xexprs.rkt checked into my local directory. I have another file 2.rkt in that same directory that has a "(require "ps04-xexprs.rkt")" statement in it. When I run normally, it reads in ps04-xexprs.rkt without a problem. However, when I try to step through 2.rkt, I get this message:

default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "C:\UserAddedPrograms\Racket\ps04-xexprs.rkt" (The system cannot find the file specified.; errno=2)

Apparently, it only looks for require files in the directory where Racket/DrRacket is installed, not in local directories as well.

This makes it impossible for me to use the stepper.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write one rkt file that requires another in the same directory. Then try to step through the first one.

 There is a workaround, which is to copy the "required" file into the directory 
 where Racket is installed. However, this is clearly not an optimal solution, 
 since there are now two copies of it.
