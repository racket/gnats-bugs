>Description:
Here is how you produce the effect: 

(define book-icon >>place book icon here from icon collects<<)

(define alist `(,book-icon ,book-icon ,book-icon))

the three occurrences of book-icon are shaded/colored differently
when they are the contractum on the right hand side of the arrow.
The first time it is underlined, the second time the contractum
hi-liting isn't visible.
