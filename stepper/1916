>Description:
When the stepper reduces `or' expressions 
(and presumably `and' expressions) intermediate
steps can be syntactically illegal because it
produces `or' expression with only one sub-expression

>How-To-Repeat:
;; reduce this in the stepper:
(or false false)

;; the first step produces:
(or false)

;; which is syntactically illegal

>Fix:
