>Description:
Here is a student program that makes the stepper break: 

;; Contract: check-guess: number number -> symbol

;; Purpose: to compare the number guessed to the actual target
   
;; Definition: 
      (define (check-guess guess target)
         (cond
            [(= guess target) 'Perfect]
            [(< guess target) 'TooSmall]
            [(> guess target) 'TooLarge]))
      
;; to implement graphical user interface to program
      (guess-with-gui check-guess)
