Try this in stepper for ISL

(local ((define-struct s (x)))

get this: 

annotate-inner: nothing expands into begin! : (list 'begin (list '#%app 'set-signature-arbitrary! 'sig (list '#%app 'apply 'arbitrary-record 'make-s (list '#%app 'list 's-x) 'arbs)))


#| ;; this is what I really want: 
(define (maker y)
  (local ((define-struct s (x)))
    (list make-s s-x)))

(define f (maker 1))
(define make-sf (first f))
(define sf-x (second f))

(define g (maker 2))
(define make-sg (first g))
(define sg-x (second g))

(sg-x (make-sg 10))

Reason>>> Duplicate of 11120, though the discussion there made this a
low priority and it sounds like you now have a use for this.

 I can't see remarks from my side on 11120, but no it isn't a high priority. 
 I wanted to brag with the stepper and explain something and the demo failed.
