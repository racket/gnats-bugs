errortrace: unrecognized (non-top-level) expression form: (db (name sam))
in below program when profiling is enabled, debug only is fine.

Enter in definitions window: (Graphical MzScheme, w/Debug & Profiling)

 (module db mzscheme
  
  (provide db get)
  
  (define db '(db (name sam)))
  
  (define (get path)
    (let get* ((db (eval (car path))) (path (cdr path)))
      (if (not (pair? path)) db
          (get* (assoc (car path) (cdr db)) (cdr path)))))
  )

 (require db)

 (get '(db name))

Then Execute, yielding:

 errortrace: unrecognized (non-top-level) expression form: (db (name sam))

 sorry, but noticed that I can't get profiling to work at all,
 so I'll assume that I'm doing something pathologically wrong;
 & can't find a simple example in docs of how it should work,
 what do I need to do to profile a simple function call like:
 
  (define (fib x) (if (< x 2) x (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2)))))
 
  (fib 30)
 
 & any known limitations? Thanks, -paul-

 apparently duplicate of earlier 6217
 
 (which I should have noticed, but didn't, sorry)
