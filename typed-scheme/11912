>Description:
It looks to me like there's a bug in the contract for
check-exn that prevents it from being used in 
typed/racket altogether; 
this looks like an easy fix to me, but perhaps
there's something subtle about it.  The reference to
the contract "#t" is a little strange...
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate this program:

#lang typed/racket

(require typed/rackunit)

(check-exn (lambda (exn) #t)
           (lambda () (/ 1 0)))

... see this result:

self-contract violation: expected <#t>, given: #<void>
  contract on check-exn from (interface for check-exn), blaming (interface for check-exn)
  contract: 
    (case->
     (-> (-> any/c Boolean) (-> Any) "#t")
     (-> (-> any/c Boolean) (-> Any) String "#t"))

 Hm. This is what can trigger that:
 
 > (define/contract x "#t" 11)
 self-contract violation: expected <#t>, given: 11
   contract on x from (definition x), blaming (definition x)
   contract: "#t"
         at: stdin::47-48
 
 
 I think that probably this message should have been something like this:
 
 self-contract violation: expected "#t", given: 11
   contract on x from (definition x), blaming (definition x)
   contract: "#t"
         at: stdin::47-48
 
 instead of what it was.
