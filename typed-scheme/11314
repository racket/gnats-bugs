>Description:
Using require/typed to import an untyped struct into typed code does not bind the struct name as a constructor, despite the fact that "struct" in untyped code and "struct:" in typed code both bind the struct name as a constructor.  Attempts to use the struct name in an expression result in an error such as:

point: identifier for static struct-type information cannot be used as an expression in: (point 1 2)

[Works as shown; remove the "#;" comment to see the error.]

  (define-struct point [x y])
  (point 1 2)
  (provide (all-defined-out)))

(module B typed/racket

    [struct point ([x : Integer] [y : Integer])])
  #;(point 1 2)

 `point' is defined with `define-struct', so I wouldn't expect `point'
 to work as a constructor.  There are a bunch of other bugs already
 reported about all the other combinations here, but I don't think this
 is a bug.

 Sam, it does work as a constructor with define-struct.  Read the note above
 the sample program.  The only thing breaking the constructor is
 require/typed.

 Hmm, you seem to be correct about this.  That'll teach me to be awake
 at this hour.  Ironically, that makes this bug easier to fix.
