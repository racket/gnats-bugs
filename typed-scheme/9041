>Description:
Typed-scheme needs to have a way to add types to structures exported from mzscheme (or, rather, from typed-scheme.ss).  I'm thinking particularly of the exceptions and srcloc, though the latter may be challenging because it doesn't have mutators.

(I claim this is a bug, not a change request, because this causes significant problems when trying to migrate existing programs to typed-scheme.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Type following in definitions window & hit run:

(module srcloc (planet "typed-scheme.ss" ("plt" "typed-scheme.plt" 2 (= 0)))
  (require-typed-struct srcloc ([source : Any]
                                [line : (Optional Number)]
                                [column : (Optional Number)]
                                [position : (Optional Number)]
                                [span : (Optional Number)])
                        mzscheme
                        #;(planet "typed-scheme.ss" 
                                ("plt" "typed-scheme.plt" 2 (= 0)))
                        ))

This produces the error 

module: identifier is already imported in: srcloc

You get the same behavior if you comment out mzscheme and uncomment out the final (planet ...) module spec.

I could wrap the typed-scheme language module in another module that exports everything from typed-scheme *except* for the srcloc identifiers, but there are two problems with that.  First, require-typed-struct doesn't work (see my next bug report).  Second, that's too much effort for something like this.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Tue, 06 May 2008 14:27:42 -0400
Reason>>> TS


State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Tue, 06 May 2008 16:04:58 -0400
Reason>>> Any such individual missing structs (or functions) are bugs
in Typed Scheme - a general workaround here is a bad idea.
