>Description:
The require-typed-struct form in typed-scheme 2.0 is broken.

(Oh well, using Typed Scheme was a nice idea while it lasted.  But since I can neither define nor import mutually recursive data structures, it simply won't work for my program.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following module definitions in foo.ss and client.ss, respectively:

(module foo mzscheme

  (define-struct foo (x y))
  (provide (struct foo (x y))))

(module client (planet "typed-scheme.ss" ("plt" "typed-scheme.plt" 2 (= 0)))
  (require-typed-struct foo ([x : Number] [y : Symbol]) "foo.ss"))

Then load client.ss into the definitions window and hit Run.  You get the error

typecheck: unbound type foo? in: foo?

 Richard: I do not think that the current version of typed scheme is
 the only version that will ever exist.
 
 Everything has bugs (hopefully more in the beginning than as time
 passes) and you are doing a valuable service by finding them and
 making small test cases for the maintainers.
 
 Thank you for that. Please don't give up hope.

 Yes, I know.

 I have a *lot* of code to write for my dissertation (which is what I'd
 hoped to use Typed Scheme for), and my funding will only last through
 August '08.  Time that I spend finding and reporting bugs in typed-scheme,
 or waiting for necessary updates, is time that I cannot spend writing the
 code for my thesis.  Yes, I can task-switch and work on writing the
 dissertation, etc., but there are limits to this: I cannot put off the
 coding efforts for much longer and still hope to finish by the deadline.
 
 So there are very real trade-offs and external constraints here, and I have
 to decide how to spend my time.  While I'm not giving up completely on
 typed-scheme just yet, I simply can't afford to spend much more time on it.
