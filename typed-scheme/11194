>Description:
Typed Racket's require/typed doesn't work with structs defined with the new "struct" form.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save following modules as untyped.rkt & typed.rkt, respectively:

#lang racket

(struct foo (bar baz))
(define f (lambda (x) (+ (foo-baz x) 3)))

(provide [struct-out foo]
         f)

#lang typed/racket

(require/typed "untyped.rkt"
               [struct foo ([bar : Number] [baz : String])]
               [f (foo -> Number)])

Run typed.rkt in DrRacket.  Resulting error:

only-in: identifier `make-foo' not included in nested require spec in: "untyped.rkt"

Change (struct foo ...) in untyped.rkt to (define-struct foo ...), and you get the right thing.

Except, no, you don't, you get another error, but that's another bug report.
