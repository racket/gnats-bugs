>Description:
The section "Libraries Provided With Typed Racket" in the Typed Racket reference lists typed/rackunit as being provided.  However it appears to be provided incompletely, and at least some of the test-case macros aren't provided.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following works:

#lang racket/base

(require rackunit)
(test-equal? "foo" 'a 'a)

----

...but the following doesn't:

#lang typed/racket/base

(require typed/rackunit)
(test-equal? "foo" 'a 'a)

...producing

test-equal?: unbound identifier in module in: test-equal?

 I've just noticed an on-list exchange of 3 December 2010, logged at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plt-scheme/Gfevn-vVdDY>, where Sam notes

 If this is still true, then it explains why they're missing in typed/rackunit, but this might be worth a brief note in the documentation.
 
 Best wishes,

 Greetings.
 
 I suspect this is not in fact a bug.  Is it the case that test-equal? and friends are expected to be used solely within the context of a test suite?
 
 I found this at the bottom of a rabbit hole which opened when the following program:
 
 #lang typed/racket/base
 (require typed/rackunit)
 (require typed/rackunit/text-ui)
 (run-tests
  (test-suite "simple"
              (test-case "foo" (check-eq? 'a 'a))))
 
 ...produced the error
 
 Type Checker: Error in macro expansion -- insufficient type information to typecheck. please add more type annotations in: (run-tests (test-suite "simple" (test-case "foo" (check-eq? (quote a) (quote a)))))
 
 I started to try to work out what 'test-case' was and was expecting, and I think ended up getting terribly confused.
 
 Therefore, this may in fact be something of a documentation bug -- it might be worth a few words somewhere to indicate how to use rackunit within Typed Racket.  I'm afraid I've no text to suggest, since I've little idea how to approach this (I"m not asking for an explanation here).
 
 All the best,
 
 Norman
