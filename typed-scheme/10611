>Description:
If I use define: and forget to annotate one argument, I get a nice, localized error for that one argument with a helpful comment about the correct syntax.  If I do the same with : syntax, I get a big and scary cascade.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start with

(: f : Number Number -> Number)
(define (f a b)
  (+ a b))

(define: (g [a : Number] [b : Number]) : Number
  (+ a b))

(f 1 2)
(g 1 2)

which is a-ok.  Remove the Number in [b : Number] and watch the pleasant result.  Reinstate, and remove one of the Number's in (: f ...).  You get three errors including cascading.

Maybe there is a version of this that is okay in some strange corner of the type language, but the default should surely be "strict", i.e., I should get an error only slightly worse than that for g (namely, one of the two arguments is missing an annotation).

 The second error reported there is a bug in the error recovery - it
 shouldn't happen.  The other two errors are real type errors.
 
 Typed Scheme always takes type annotations as definitive, regardless
 of the value supplied.  This is a conscious design choice, born of too
 much experience with typed languages that don't do that.

 I respect that decision, but please document it.  It would be helpful
 if the guide and reference said precisely the first sentence above,
 and a sentence or two of clarification of what this might mean:
 
   For instance, suppose you define
 
   (: addtwo Number -> Number)
   (define (addtwo x y) (+ x y))
 
   (addtwo 1 2)
   (addtwo 3 4)
 
   Typed Scheme will not report this as an error about the annotation
   on addtwo.  Rather, it will report both the function definition and
   its uses as erroneous.
 
   [You could, in the Guide, then add a sentence or two explaining why
   you chose this decision.]
