>Description:
I've been trying to use Typed Racket for a game project, and my code includes a lot of assignments to an f32vector. I imported it into Typed Racket such as this:

(require/typed ffi/vector
    [opaque F32Vector f32vector?]
    [f32vector-set! (F32Vector Integer Float -> Void)])

Unfortuantely, this completely kills the program performance due to all the runtime type checks. Would it be possible to have TR support this module "natively"?
