 Might be worth noting that this doesn't happen with #:no-optimize, so
 the bug is either in the optimizer or it's because TR doesn't correctly
 populate the type-table.

 I'm pretty sure it's the latter.

 I mentioned this on IRC, but just for the record: my hypothesis is that
 this happens because Typed Racket does not have a flag it sets on
 conditional tests that indicates "neither branch can be taken".
 
 Currently it has "the test is always #f" (contradiction), "the test is
 always #t" (tautology), and "it could be either" (neither).
 
 The "neither branch" case gets lumped into the contradiction case by TR,
 so when the optimizer looks at it, it tries to optimize an else branch
 that was never checked.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 I have a commit somewhere in the queue which changes this to keep
 track of two booleans instead of the complicated triple now. I don't
 know if it solves this issue in particular though.
