>Description:
I was able to get an internal error in type scheme. The program below produces the error. Lots of changes fix it, but I think the big reason it is failing is that it is (U T+ 2) not (U (T+ elem) 2). 

It should be giving either a syntax error, or some other user error.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/scheme



(define-type (T+ elem)
  (U (A elem)))

(define-type (T elem)
  (U T+ 2))

(define-struct: (x) A ())

Evaluates to:
Rep-seq: expects argument of type <struct:Rep>; given #f
