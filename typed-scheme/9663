>Description:
See below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter following in definitions window, module language:

    #lang typed-scheme

    (require/opaque-type Srcloc srcloc scheme)

Hit run.  Following message will appear in interactions window:

    tmp: illegal use of syntax in: tmp

Same thing happens if you save the module to a file and load it in mzscheme.

 I realized after I sent this bug report that there's a typo in my sample
 code.  The require/opaque-type should read
 
     (require/opaque-type Srcloc srcloc? scheme)
 
 Note the question mark on the second argument.  With the question mark,
 Typed Scheme compiles the module without any error messages, as I expect.
 
 The original error message still needs to be replaced, though.

 Just for a second point of reference, if you try the following:
 
    #lang typed-scheme
 
    (require/opaque-type Posn posn lang/posn)
 
 (note, like in Richard's example, the use of the struct name posn  
 instead of the predicate posn?)
 
 you get the error:
 
 tmp: identifier for static struct-type information cannot be used as  
 an expression in: tmp
 
 which at least points in the right direction even though the error  
 still involves the introduced identifier.  I found it interesting that  
 the error message was different (and slightly better, though it could  
 be improved), so I figured I'd throw this example up too in case it  
 helped (and because I'm curious why the two examples differ in their  
 errors when it seems like they should be the same).

Reason>>> I've improved the error message's source location, so now it
will print:

srcloc: illegal use of syntax in: srcloc

and highlight the appropriate expression.  After talking to
Ryan, it doesn't seem possible to make it give a better message.
