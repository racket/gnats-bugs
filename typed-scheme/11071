>Description:
I'd like to be able to use require-typed to import mutually-recursive structures from an untyped module into a typed module (especially given the limitations on structure definitions in typed modules, as per my last bug report).
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following files as foo.rkt and bar.rkt respectively:

#lang racket

(define-struct a (x))
(define-struct b (x))
(provide (struct-out a)
         (struct-out b))

#lang typed/racket

(require/typed "foo.rkt"
               (struct a ([x : (Listof b)]))
               (struct b ([x : (Listof a)])))

Then load bar.rkt into DrRacket's definitions window & hit "Run".  DrRacket highlights the occurrence of "b" on the last line of bar.rkt and issues the error:
    reference to an identifier before its definition: b?

Splitting the two struct clauses into separate invocations of require/typed produces the same results.
