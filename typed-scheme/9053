>Description:
typed-scheme must extend require-typed-struct to allow for substructures.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following modules as source.ss and client.ss, respectively.

(module source mzscheme

  (define-struct term (posn))           ;; lambda-calc term w/ srcloc info
  (define-struct (var term) (id))
  (define-struct (lam term) (arg body))
  (define-struct (app term) (rator rand))

  (provide (all-defined)))

(module client (planet "typed-scheme.ss" ("plt" "typed-scheme.plt" 2 (= 2)))

  (require-typed-struct term ([posn : Number]) "source.ss")
  (require-typed-struct var ([posn : Number]
                             [id : Symbol])
                        "source.ss"))

Load client.ss into the definitions window, module language, and hit Run.  You will get an error message: 
   require: no such provided variable in: var-posn
If you comment out the `posn' field in `var' in client.ss and re-execute, you get a different error:
  checked client
  make-var broke the contract (-> symbol? ???) ; expected a procedure that accepts 1 arguments, given: #<primitive:make-var>

 The obvious workaround (deleting the extra field) works, but doesn't
 define it as a substructure, so this bug is still open.
