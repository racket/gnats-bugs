>Description:
This is probably just an example of a more general error, either in inference or in specification for base environment types.

The `expt' function type has (at least) these cases:

  expt : Real Zero -> One
  expt : Real (U Negative-Integer Positive-Integer) -> Real

However, TR infers the type of applications with `Real' and `Integer' arguments as `Number'. This keeps `math/matrix' from cleanly implementating a Vandermonde matrix constructor.

I've verified that a quick fix is to change this case:

  (-Real (Un -NegInt -PosInt) . -> . -Real)

to this case:

  (-Real -Int . -> . -Real)

Of course, it's not a general solution.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (expt (ann 5 Real) (ann 2 Integer))
- : Number
25

The result should have type `Real'.
