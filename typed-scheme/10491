The following type:

  (All (A) A -> A)

throws an error saying:

  typecheck: not a valid type: (A)

and highlights the "(A)".

My bet is that there is nobody in the world that knows what that means other
than people who sit within 10m from Sam.

 It means that (A) is not a valid type, from which I further deduce
 that for one reason or another the type parser expected a type there,
 not a sequence of type variables.  For instance, perhaps you are
 missing parentheses around the "A -> A" and thus TS is not recognizing
 your "All" form.  I could have figured that out even if you moved my
 seat, though, I'm pretty sure.

 10 meters!

 I can debate how likely people are to do this inference -- but it's
 already clear that errors are not a good place to place riddles for
 the viewers' amusement.

 Now, *this* is a leap that nobody would do.  The obvious thing that
 people would ask if they see this is "why *wouldn't* TS recognize a
 form that begins with `All' as an `All' form=3F=3F".

 Well, to be more serious, this is a bad error message for random
 hackers, and if the intention is to attract such people, then this
 should be made very clear.  It's an error that would trip both veteran
 schemers (who are used to simple syntax where there's never any
 parsing issues), and newbie ones (who are used to parens being usually
 not too important).

 I should (almost obviously) also add that this is related to the
 inevitable confusion that results from an infix syntax with required
 parenthesizing.  Same deal as (A -> B -> C) being surprising.

 Amen.
 
 Which brings us to the question why TS and Contracts use different  
 notation.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Wed, 19 May 2010 12:27:56 -0400
