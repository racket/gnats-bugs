readline-input:4.0
; readline-input:4:0: Type Checker: Polymorphic function call-with-input-string
;   could not be applied to arguments:
; Wrong number of arguments - Expected 2, but got 1
; Argument 1:
;   Expected: String
;   Given:    (Any -> (values (Positive-Byte : (Top | Bot)) (Positive-Byte :
;     (Top | Bot))))
; Argument 2:
;   Expected: (Input-Port -> a)
;   Given:    -none-
; Result type:     a
; Expected result: AnyValues
;   in: (call-with-input-string (lambda (input) (values 2 3)))
; [,bt for context]
>How-To-Repeat:
(call-with-input-string (lambda (input) (values 2 3)))
