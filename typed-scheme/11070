>Description:
Two problems with Typed Racket's support for structures:

1) I can't use field modifiers like #:mutable in a typed module.
2) When I'm trying to use require/typed to pull an untyped struct definition into a typed module, I have to specify the #:extra-constructor-name property in the source module, or the typed module complains that it can't find make-foo.

Not hugely critical, because I can work around this by putting the struct definition in an untyped module and using require-typed with #:extra-constructor-name.  However, see the bug report I'm going to submit in about 5 minutes for an important limitation of this technique.

 This is PR 9674.  The infrastructure is now in place to support this,
 so hopefully it will happen soon.
 
 You can of course use #:mutable on the whole structure.
