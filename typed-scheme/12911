 Indeed -- I was thinking about this just last night. Sadly, I don't
 think it can be made to work exactly as it does now, but in multiple
 places, because exceptions and thus test results can't be sent between
 places.  Here are the options I've thought of (only for the
 integration tests, which are the slow part):
 
  - Run each test in a separate place, and if it fails, re-run it in
 the main place for the real result. Almost as good if not much fails,
 but wasteful.
  - Run tests in separate places, serialize the results of exceptions,
 and re-raise them in the main place.
  - Run tests in separate places, serialize results, and check them
 (using some `result` structure) in the main place.
 
 Kevin, do you have any other suggestions?

 Exceptions don't go across because they contain continuation marks (I
 presume). But you don't need the continuation marks to report a test
 failure (and if you want them, you can turn whatever it is you want
 about them into a string or something first, eg by calling the
 error-display-handler in the place).

 I would use your last idea and serialize the exception and stack trace 
 information using prefab structs and lists.
