>Description:
The following program fails to type-check:

#lang typed/racket

(for/sum ([k (in-naturals)])
  (/ 1 (* k k)))

which is fine, but the error message is:

Type Checker: No function domains matched in function application:
Argument 1:
  Expected: Integer
  Given:    Exact-Rational
Argument 2:
  Expected: Integer
  Given:    Integer

Result type:     AnyValues
Expected result: #(struct:tc-any-results)

where a #(struct:tc-any-results) has leaked through.

 Do we have a good name for what we want to show users in this case?
 Should we show AnyValues, also do we need a better name for AnyValues?

 Sam decided that we should just show AnyValues here for now.
