 I expect that this is because the file doesn't start with #lang
 typed-scheme, which enables the reader syntax that starts with #{.  If
 that isn't the case, please send the whole file that behaves this way.

 Alternately, Shriram may be entering these annotations at the REPL.
 Unfortunately, the interactions window does not inherit the custom
 reader from the definitions window (in any #lang).  You have to use
 (inst ...) at the REPL, or enter the #{ ... } annotations in the
 definitions window.

 Ah, of course.  We really should fix that about the REPL.  What's the
 status of that?

 The file doesn't: it begins with
 
 (module memoize typed-scheme
 
   (require scheme/local)
   (require scheme/list)
   ...)
 
 How should I rewrite this?

 Like this:
 
 #lang typed-scheme
 
 (require scheme/local)
 (require scheme/list)
 ...
 
 If you want to use (module there are two options:
 
 1. use the `inst' syntax explicitly
 2. use #reader typed-scheme/typed-reader at the beginning of the file.

 It's not necessary - you should use '#lang typed-scheme'.

 The font issue?  I've fixed that on my branch, it should be in the next release.
