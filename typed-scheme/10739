 The type could say that if it returns true, the argument is a `Real',
 but that if it returns false the argument is not an `Integer'.
 Currently, there's no type that corresponds exactly to the `integer?'
 predicate (this is the subject of a different bug).  However, Typed
 Scheme does not have a notation for this, since I haven't found a way
 to make it non-confusing.  How would you present that to your
 students?
