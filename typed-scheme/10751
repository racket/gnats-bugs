>Description:
Providing a redundant type annotation for an imported, typed definition yields the following error message:

Type Checker: Declaration for x provided, but with no definition in: x

This is somewhat confusing, as x has a definition, it is merely in a different module.  It would be helpful if Typed Scheme clarified that a declaration requires a definition in the same module, or detected that the binding comes from another module and gave a more specific error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme/load

(module A typed/scheme
  (: x Integer)
  (define x 1)
  (provide x))

(module B typed/scheme
  (require 'A)
  (: x Integer)
  (provide x))
