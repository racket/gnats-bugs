>Description:
The programs in reproduction steps used to work in student languages. Program 1 stopped working sometime between Dec. 2014 (when I rewrote Plot in Typed Racket) and Feb. 2015 (now). Program 2 stopped working sometime between Sep. 2014 (RacketCon) and Feb. 2015.

The error message in both programs is "function call: expected a function after the open parenthesis, but found a part".
>How-To-Repeat:
Program 1:

(require plot)
(plot (function sin -4 4))


Program 2:

(require pict3d)
(sphere '(0 0 0) 1/2)

 The bug is on the TR side. You need to write an adapter that imports your TR function, use first-order->higher-order from lang/prim to make it suitable for BSL, and re-export it. You can also use provide...higher-order ...
