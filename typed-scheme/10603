If the sub-structure of a typed structure is off (which is easy to do w/ all those parens), the error message can be much more helpful in zeroing in on the location of the error.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-struct: vertex ([datum : (Listof String)] [edges : Listof(vertex)]) #:transparent)

gives

define-struct:: bad syntax in: <whole thing>

when it really ought to highlight the Listof (vertex) part (or even that whole field's clause).

 On my branch (not merged to trunk yet) this now produces a much better
 error message, courtesy of `syntax-parse'.
