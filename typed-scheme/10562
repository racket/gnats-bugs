>Description:
So, I was very happy to see that the inference uses the expected type of the box
to avoid `ann' tricks, and I modified my explanation to show them how you'd use
`Rec':

  #lang pl
  (: foo : (Rec this (List Number (Boxof (U #f this)))))
  (define foo (list 1 (box #f)))
  (set-box! (second foo) foo)

but this doesn't work again.  I could make it work with

  (: foo : (Rec this (List Number (Boxof (U #f this)))))
  (define foo (list 1 (box (ann #f : (U #f (Rec this (List Number (Boxof (U #f this)))))))))

but the point is lost here, and it's harder to explain than the previous point...

(BTW, box types are still printed as `Box' instead of `Boxof'.)

 I think I'd try to explain this with a function for making cyclical  
 boxes, and yes, this is one of those warts where TS differs a lot from  
 S.
