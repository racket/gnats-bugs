>Description:
TR has the problem that it has code that is only conditionally enabled for debugging (contracts) because it makes it slower. This very often falls out of sync with the real implementation because it isn't tested. It should be tested on DrDr even if it is disabled by default for most users.

 There are two issues here.
 
 1. We'd need to compile conditionally based on the presence of DrDr,
 because I don't want to change to making the contracts a runtime
 check.
 
 2. The TR tests already are the longest-running test in DrDr, and this
 would probably double that.
 
 However, Robby did some tests a while back that indicated that
 switching on the `provide/contract` contracts unconditionally didn't
 make a noticeable performance impact, so it might be worth trying
 that.

 For part1 couldn't the code that has (define contracts-enabled #f) be
 changed to read the environment variable that DrDr sets.
 
 Another option would be that the contracts could still be parsed and
 evaluated at compile time, but not enforced. That would catch the
 class of errors where the contracts are misspelled, which I have seen
 a few times.

 You could have a runtime check that put any/c in place of the actual
 contract, eg:
 
 (provide/contract [f (if contracts-on? (-> integer? integer?) any/c)])
 
 There shouldn't be any significant overhead to this strategy (ditto
 for define/contract).
 
 I don't think you need to go the conditional compilation route. And,
 well, if you did, that's something that I'd want to look into anyways.

 TR already has gone the conditional compilation route.

 Right. I understand. I'm suggesting that instead if you always compile
 the contracts and use a runtime test to enable them, then you could
 more easily enable them in drdr.
