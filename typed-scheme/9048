>Description:
require-typed-struct doesn't work if the struct is provided with contracts.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following as source.ss:

  (module source mzscheme

    (require (lib "contract.ss"))

    (define-struct ast (loc))

    (provide/contract (struct ast ([loc srcloc?])))
    ;(provide (struct ast (loc)))
  )

Enter the following in the definitions window (module language):

  (module client (planet "typed-scheme.ss"
                   ("plt" "typed-scheme.plt" 2 (= 2)))
  
    (require-typed-struct ast ([loc : Any]) "source.ss"))

Hit Run; you'll get the error 

    typecheck: Untyped definition in: (define-values (lifted) (begin (#%app contract/proc provide/contract-contract-id-ast? ast? provide/contract-pos-module-source-ast? (#%app module-source-as-symbol (quote-syntax ast?)) (quote-syntax ast?))))

If you comment out the provide/contract form in source.ss, uncomment the provide form, and re-run the client module definition, it works fine.
