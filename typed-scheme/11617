>Description:
The program below gives a certificate error about the struct name "one" produced by the match expander "uno" used by module B.  Module A is able to use the match expander, and both modules can use it if switched to typed/racket/no-check.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module A typed/racket
  (provide (all-defined-out))
  (struct: one ([thing : Any]))
  (define-match-expander uno
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(_ x) (one x)]))
  (match (one 2)
    [(uno dos) dos]))

(require 'A)

(module B typed/racket
  (require 'A)
  (match (one 2)
    [(uno dos) dos]))

(require 'B)

 With the new taint system, this program runs correctly. I think this bug should be closed.
