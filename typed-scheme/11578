>Description:
The following program fails with a syntax error. It does not fail if module a is written in typed/racket/base/no-check, or module b is written in typed/racket/base. I think the bug relates to the fact that foo is bound to both the static struct info and the constructor, because it works fine with define-struct: and make-foo.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load


(module a typed/racket/base
  (provide foo)
  (struct: foo ()))

(module b racket/base
  (require 'a)
  (foo))


(require 'b)
