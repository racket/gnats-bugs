Same goes for `second', `third', etc and for `rest' -- all of
these require proper lists.  (This is why srfi/1 doesn't use
these -- its bindings do not have that requirement.)

 1. Even in ML, (second '(1)) signals a run-time exception (but yes, I =
 can see that this kind of things should be listed).=20
 
 2. Of course, (first '(1 . 2)) should NOT signal a run-time exception =
 given the type of first.=20

 But it does require a proper list (not that ML has any other kind).

 Yes, that's the problem -- unlike srfi/1,  `first' is not an alias for
 `car' -- it throws a type error when given an improper list.  (This is
 done unrelated to TS -- the issue is that TS can reflect this
 requirement, but doesn't.)
