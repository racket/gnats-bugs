>Description:
Typed Racket's struct constructor detection only works when constructors are used in the same module as the struct is defined.
>How-To-Repeat:
test1.rkt

#lang typed/racket
(provide (struct-out foo))
(struct: foo ())


test2.rkt

#lang typed/racket
(require "test1.rkt")
(foo)


Constructor detection won't be able to find the call to `foo' in test2.rkt.
