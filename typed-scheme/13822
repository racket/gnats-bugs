>Description:
I'm not sure what exactly is going on in the following snippet, but
it seems like the subtyping check should fail here between the list
of falses and Foo. Especially since `x` is not useable as a list 
afterwards.

#lang typed/racket

(define-type (Foo A) (Rec X (Listof (Option X))))

(: x Foo)
(define x '(#f #f))
(car x)
