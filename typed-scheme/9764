>Description:
* TS tests use with-output-to-file "/dev/null"

 - not good, happens to work since windows uses cygwin but will fail
   if other people try it on windows.

* match tests use (open-output-string), not a good idea either

* Both check for PLT_TESTS, which is not set.

 - The `match' tests are still running, but without the
   output-string, which indicates that it is not needed (and the
   PLT_TESTS condition is not needed)

 - The TS tests are simply not running without that environment
   variable set.  I did that manually, and it doesn't work, but no
   information is displayed.  I removed the "/dev/null" redirection
   and still no output (which means that it is not needed too).  I
   also tried to change a test to fail (succeed/andmap - tried to
   change a number, or replace one by a string).

Things to do (which I didn't do):

* Remove both output redirections.

* Remove PLT_TESTS checks (I can add it, but it doesn't look necessary
 so far) -- in the TS case, add a file that will be required that
 does run the tests.

* For TS, find out what test is failing

* And an item that I don't need, but you'll probably want: make the TS
 tests show something when there's a failure.
