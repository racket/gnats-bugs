>Description:
As currently implemented, typed-scheme allows the following structure definition:

   (define-struct: foo ([bar : Number] [baz : String])
      #:mutable)

But I'd also like to be able to write the typed version of the following:

    (define-struct foo ([bar #:mutable] baz))

The obvious attempt below fails with a syntax error.

    (define-struct: foo ([(bar : Number) #:mutable]
                         [baz : String]))

Removing the parens (as distinct from brackets) around `bar : Number' also produces a syntax error.

If there's a way to do this, I couldn't find it in the manual.

 I should add that I don't have a specific concrete syntax in mind for
 field-specific #:mutable flags.  In particular, I'm certainly not
 suggesting the first syntax I tried -- too many parens/brackets.  Something
 like my second attempt might be OK, though, even if the juxtaposition of
 the type and the #:mutable flag is a bit weird.
