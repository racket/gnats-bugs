>Description:
Consider the following snippet:

#lang typed/racket
(: g (All (a ...) (a ... a -> (List a ... a))))
(define (g . rst)
  (map
   ;; 'a' is in scope due to map rule
   (lambda: ([y : a]) 
     (map
      ;; in scope again
      (lambda: ([z : a])
        (set! y z)
        z)
      rst)
     y)
   rst))

Here's an example interaction you can get:

> (g 1 "foo" 'bar)
- : (Listof (U One String 'bar)) [generalized from (List One String 'bar)]
'(bar bar bar)
> (first (g 1 "foo" 'bar))
- : Integer [generalized from One]
'bar

 Does the paper that introduced the polydot concept have an executable
 redex model, or is the only model TR? I would want to see how this is
 actually solved in the formalism to guide the solution in the
 implementation.
