>Description:
Program using pattern matching with tuples of unions takes surprisingly long to typecheck. There seems to be an exponential blowup.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following program still typechecks after 5 minutes on my computer. Racket 6.0.1 (release) checks this program quickly as expected.

#lang typed/racket

(: f : Any → Any)
(define (f x)
  (match x
    [(list (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))) #t]
    [_ #f]))


The following changes affect the time:

1. Removing the seemingly cheap wildcard clause reduces typechecking time to ~15 seconds on my computer:

(: f : Any → Any)
(define (f x)
  (match x
    [(list (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))) #t]))

2. Removing annotation also significantly reduces the time. The following takes ~15 seconds, inferring (Any -> Boolean):

(define (f x)
  (match x
    [(list (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))) #t]
    [_ #f]))

3. However, changing #t and #f to say, 1 and 0, makes the (unannotated) program run forever again:

(define (f x)
  (match x
    [(list (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))
           (or (? integer?) (? string?) (? false?))) 1]
    [_ 0]))

 Thanks for the report Phil.
 
 I did a git bisect and it found that the first commit where this issue
 shows up is 62b41b39e76cc1eeef81f63d6dd28a37dd145ed8.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
