The following two-module program yields this compile error:

struct-copy: accessor name not associated with the given structure type in: Point-x

There is no error if the program is combined into one module.

 I think this is a problem in the way `struct-copy' is implemented, but
 I'm not sure.  Here's a program with no types that has the same
 problem (for the same reason):
 
 #lang scheme/load
 
 (module A scheme
 
   (define-struct Point (x y))
   (define-syntax Point-x* (make-rename-transformer (syntax-property
 #'Point-x 'not-free-identifier=3D? #t)))
   (provide Point (rename-out [Point-x* Point-x])))
 
 (module B scheme
 
   (require 'A)
   (define (lift p)
     (struct-copy Point p [x 1])))

 In that case, could you assign this to someone more appropriate?

 The problem is, I'm not sure if this is something that I need to
 handle differently, or something where `struct-copy' needs to change.
 But I've reassigned it to Matthew for now.
