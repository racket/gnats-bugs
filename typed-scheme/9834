Because
  X -> Y -> Z
is commonly parsed in static languages by associating to the right,
typed scheme should not do what it's doing now, which is treating the
first one as an unbound type.  It should either bite the whole thing
and do the same, or at least throw a sensible syntax error.

 FWIW, after several years of experiments with . -> . (not with a true
 infix arrow tho), I've just given up and been completely happy with a
 prefix arrow in the contract language.

 Sam, if you are going with infix notation that must parse, you may  
 really want to pay attention to operator precedence. For now, throw a  
 sensible error.
