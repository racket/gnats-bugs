 It turns out that you don't have to start out in an untyped REPL to
 trigger this bug. For example:
 
   $ racket -I typed/racket
   Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.1.
   -> (: list* Integer)
   -> (+ list* 1)
   ; +: contract violation
   ;   expected: number?
   ;   given: #<procedure:list*>
   ;   argument position: 1st
   ; [,bt for context]
 
 (because `list*` has no type in the base type environment)
 
 If you import an untyped library, you can do the same thing:
 
   $ racket -I typed/racket
   Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.1.
   -> (require syntax/stx)
   -> (: stx-car 3)
   -> stx-car
   - : Integer [more precisely: 3]
   #<procedure:stx-car>
 
 It looks like this has been around for a while and isn't a regression
 (present in v5.2.1).
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
