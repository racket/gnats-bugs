Then an inner module requires a restricted version of a typed module, it takes forever to load before failing.
>How-To-Repeat:
File a.rkt:
#lang typed/racket/base
(provide (all-defined-out))

(define x 42)
(define y 43)

File b.rkt:

#lang racket/base

(module+ test
  (require (except-in "a.rkt" x))
  y)

Just to make sure it's not typechecking that's long, compile a.rkt first:
> raco make a.rkt

This returns quickly. Then run:
> racket b.rkt

This will take about 5 minutes then fail on my machine (Ubuntu 15.04 64 bit):
> Bus error (core dumped)

Notice that the file loads normally if we either use untyped Racket in a.rkt or remove "except-in" in b.rkt.

 I can no longer reproduce this issue on HEAD (but can in v6.2) so I think it
 was probably fixed by the new expander or some other recent change.
 
 So I'll go ahead and close the bug. Thanks.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
