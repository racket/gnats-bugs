>Description:
Right now, typed-scheme's `require-typed-struct' form doesn't support structures with parents.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save as a.ss:

#lang scheme
(define-struct a (x))
(define-struct (b a) (y))
(provide (struct-out a) (struct-out b))

Save as b.ss:

#lang typed-scheme
(require-typed-struct a ([x : String]) "a.ss")
(require-typed-struct b ([y : Integer]) "a.ss")

Save as c.ss:

#lang typed-scheme
(require-typed-struct a ([x : String]) "a.ss")
(require-typed-struct b ([x : String] [y : Integer]) "a.ss")

Execute b, and you get the following in the interactions window:

    make-b broke the contract (-> integer? pred-cnt) on make-b; expected a procedure that accepts 1 argument without any keywords, given: #<procedure:make-b>

(Ideally this error message shouldn't mention contracts, either.)

Execute c.ss, and you get the following in the interactions window:

    only-in: identifier `b-x' not included in nested require spec in: "a.ss"

This is particularly unfortunate, as it means that you can't use any of the built-in exception structures in a typed module.

 Indeed, this is problematic.

 However, some of the exceptions structures are available: exn,
 exn:fail and exn:fail:read.  Which ones are you particularly
 interested in, since that can be fixed much more quickly?

 I'm interested in defining my own exceptions that extend exn:fail:contract.
