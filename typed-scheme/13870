>Description:
For some reason, using a pattern like (list x xs ...) in a match on a list of a known type (say, (Listof Integer)) loses the type information about variables created with the ellipsis pattern (in this case, xs). Instead, Typed Racket can only infer that it has type (Listof Any).
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to run the following program:

#lang typed/racket

(: sum ((Listof Integer) -> Integer))
(define (sum l)
  (match l
    [(list) 0]
    [(list x xs ...) (+ x (sum xs))]))

(sum (list 1 2 3))
