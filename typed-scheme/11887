>Description:
The test case appears to be minimal. In particular, both inside and two elts are required.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(define-struct: [e f] doll ((inside : (Option (doll e f)))
                            (elt1 : e)

(: singleton (All (e f) (e f -> (doll e f))))
(define (singleton e f)
