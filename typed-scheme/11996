>Description:
The following program gives the following error message:

Type Checker: untyped top-level identifier lifted.0 in: (long-expression foo).

In some sense I would like foo to be typed, but aslong as I am not given a message about lifted.0, it would be better.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module c racket
  (define foo 'foo)
  (provide foo))

(module b typed/racket
  (require/typed 'c (foo Symbol))
  (provide foo))



(module a racket 
  (require typed/racket)
  (require 'b)
  (with-type #:result Symbol (let ((long-expression foo)) long-expression)))

Reason>>> Example appears to work in Racket 5.90
