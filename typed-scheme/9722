This causes an error in Typed Scheme

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1.0.2-svn29aug2008 [3m].

tmp: this predicate must be applied to an argument; expected an open parenthesis before the predicate name in: tmp

#lang typed-scheme

Where beginner has changed to advanced.  Since both
export bindings for posns, both should work.

 I'm not sure if this is really a Typed Scheme bug.  What's happening
 is that `posn?' as provided from `lang/htdp-beginner' is a macro that
 can only be used in application position, and otherwise gives an
 error.  However, Typed Scheme doesn't know about this requirement, and
 so uses it in a way that `posn?' doesn't like.  The Advanced `posn?'
 is just a procedure (I think), so it doesn't have this problem.
 
 So in general, if you import a struct that has the appropriate names
 provided, but they're macros that expect to be used in certain ways,
 that won't necessarily work with Typed Scheme.  But I don't know if
 this is something that I either could or should fix.
 
 What do other people think?
 
 Thanks,

 I agree with Sam. Posn in beginner is explicitly restricted not to  
 work with a higher-order functional language, such as TypedScheme,  
 and the error messages actually explains this reasonably well.
 
 Put differently, Typed Scheme is designed to cooperate with Scheme.  
 It may accidentally work with other languages that float around in  
 our empire, but this really is an accident. The "language contract"  
 between TS and the language of the other modules is that both have  
 the same semantics when you strip type information. This is not true  
 for BSL.
