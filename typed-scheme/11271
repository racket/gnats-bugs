>Description:
Look at the "Steps to Reproduce" below.  These types are utterly unreadable.  I had to copy-and-paste them into my editor of choice, traverse each s-expression, insert newlines, and line up the results, to see what it was expecting.  This, of course, is what pretty-printing does (though a custom printer that understands constructors like All, case-lambda, and -> would be preferable, so the output looks like

(All (a b) 
  (case-lambda
    ((Listof a) (a a -> Boolean) [#:cache-keys? Boolean] 
     -> (Listof a))
    ((Listof a) (b b -> Boolean) [#:cache-keys? Boolean] #:key (a -> b) 
     -> (Listof a))))

and

(case-lambda
 (Fixnum Zero -> Boolean)
 (Integer Zero -> Boolean)
 (Nonnegative-Fixnum Fixnum -> Boolean)
 (Fixnum Negative-Fixnum -> Boolean)
 (Exact-Nonnegative-Integer Fixnum -> Boolean)
 (Exact-Nonnegative-Integer Integer -> Boolean)
 (Integer Exact-Nonnegative-Integer -> Boolean)
 (Nonnegative-Float Float -> Boolean)
 (Float Nonnegative-Float -> Boolean)
 (Real Real Real * -> Boolean))
>How-To-Repeat:
> sort
- : (All (a b) (case-lambda ((Listof a) (a a -> Boolean) [#:cache-keys? Boolean] -> (Listof a)) ((Listof a) (b b -> Boolean) [#:cache-keys? Boolean] #:key (a -> b) -> (Listof a))))
