Subject: TR doesn't support covariant immutable hashtables

>Number:         13294

>Description:
TR treats immutable hashtables and mutable hashtables as the same type. This means that the covariance of immutable hashtables is lost, which is a pain when programming with them, because I expect them to be covariant (in the values)
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
