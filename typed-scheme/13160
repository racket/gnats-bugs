 The following replacement for struct-reexport-outer.rkt uses 
 all-from-out instead of struct-out, and compiles and runs successfully:
 
 #lang typed/racket/base
 (require "pr13160-inner.rkt")
 (provide (all-from-out "pr13160-inner.rkt"))

 I think this is a bug in `struct-out` -- Typed Racket isn't doing
 anything strange with the `struct:the-struct` binding.
