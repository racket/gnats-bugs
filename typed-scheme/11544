>Description:
For some reason, when typechecking the body of some/function, Typed Racket claims that "constant" is untyped, even though its type is clearly declared.  It should either figure out that it is typed, or state "identifier whose type has not yet been discovered" or some such.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(define (some/function x) constant)
(: constant Any)
(define constant 1)

  | Let TR typecheck more un-annotated definitions
  | 
  | This commit allows definitions without type annotations
  | to refer to definitions later in a module that do have
  | type annotations. For example,
  | 
  |   (define (f x) (g 0))
  |   (: g (-> Integer Integer))
  |   (define (g x) (add1 x))
  | 
  | Previously, such cases required shuffling type annotations
  | and/or definitions around to satisfy the type-checker.
  | 
  | Note that typechecking may still depend on ordering when
  | there are not enough type annotations in the code.
  | 
  | Closes PR 11544
