 We don't really have a good "multiple error messages with multiple
 source locations each" setup in drscheme. If we did, TS could use it,
 but I think that this requires some tweaking at a number of different
 layers before TS gets involved (mzscheme to even set up the right
 paths of communication and then drs to do something with the new
 information that is being communicated and then TS to actually use the
 new paths).

 Right.  Currently, all of those earlier error messages are reported in
 separate threads.  In order to highlight everything that's incorrect,
 I have to report a syntax error that mentions all of the relevant
 syntax objects, leading to the long messages you see.
 
 I'm happy to change the implementation to something that works better,
 but I don't know what that would be right now.
