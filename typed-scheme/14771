>Description:
the typed racket language doesn't seems to support weak boxes. Functions such as 'weak-box-make' and so on don't have types, and the documentation for typed racket doesn't mention them, though it does mention ephemerons which seems a bit odd.
>How-To-Repeat:
@lang typed/racket

(: foo (Boxof (Vectorof Integer)))
(define foo (vector 1 2 3))

; (: bar (Weak-Boxof (Vectorof Integer)))
(define bar (make-seak-box (unbox foo))
