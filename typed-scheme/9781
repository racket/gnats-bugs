>Description:
This is more of a "note for something you might want to consider alternatives for" instead of a true bug, but the fact that

(inst cons Number)

ends up giving you

typecheck: Wrong number of type arguments to polymorphic type (All (a b) (case-lambda (a (Listof a) -> (Listof a)) (a b -> (Pair a b)))):
expected: 2
got: 1 in: cons

Because the polymorphism is outside the case lambda, the branch that needs the most type variables determines how many are needed for the entire polymorphic case-lambda statement, even though you'd be just as well suited by something like:

(case-lambda
  (All (a) (a (Listof a) -> (Listof a)))
  (All (a b) (a b -> (Pair a b))))

So allowing polymorphic branches for a case-lambda that have different numbers of type variables might be useful.

 I have gotten this error before and didn't take the time out to dig  
 into it.
