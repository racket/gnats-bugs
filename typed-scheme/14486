>Description:
It can't convert class types to contracts, so I can't use cast, and I can't require them from an untyped module.  
And I can't even cast it as a ClassTop or use require/untyped-contract with ClassTop, and when I try to use require/untyped-contract with Any, it gives me a contract violation saying I can't pass a higher-order value in as Any.

 Non-Top Class types should usually work when converted to contracts in
 casts.
 
 Exporting a value of type ClassTop to untyped code won't work because TR
 doesn't know what methods or fields the class even has, so it can't
 protect them appropriately.
 
 Importing it from untyped code with ClassTop, though, should be allowed
 but currently isn't (I'll fix that).  Though TR won't let you do very
 much with that imported class anyway.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
