 I've started looking into it.
 
 Interestingly, only `null' doesn't error. If I try
 
     (define y (for/fold: ((x : Integer "foo")) ((v : Integer null)) x))
 
 or other non-integer values, I get an error as expected.

 Investigation shows that it is in let-loop-check for for/list in
 tc-app-lambda.rkt.
