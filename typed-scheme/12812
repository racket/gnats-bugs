 I don't think this is a subtyping problem, it's just that both
 `filter` and `values` are polymorphic.

 What I meant was that this is a known limitation of TR relating to
 polymorphic functions and polymorphic arguments, and doesn't have
 anything to do with either subtyping or `values` per se.

 Is there a rule for when you can use polymorphic functions and/or arguments? Since sometimes it seems to work. Also I think there is something amiss with the type checking for values.
 
 #lang typed/racket
 (: f (All (a) (a -> a)))
 (define (f x) x)
 
 (filter f empty)
 ((inst filter #f #f) values empty)
 
 =>
 
 Type Checker: Expected (False -> Any), but got (All (a ...) (a ... a -> (values a ... a))) in: values
 
 but type checking the polymorphic filter and f expression works fine.

 In general, it won't work, but sometimes it will.  Perhaps making it
 work in some cases is a mistake, since it eliminates the simple rule.

 I think this is about the variable arity type for values, which
 inference isn't doing the right thing for.  That definitely looks like
 a bug.
