>Description:
The error that appears when trying to apply a polymorphic higher order function to another polymorphic function in Typed Racket (e.g. applying map to cons) is difficult to interpret (and this is coming from a PL grad student). It's not obvious at first what the "Types" line means (I assume these are the possible types of the function?), and while it's relatively clear what "Arguments" means, on first reading I thought that Types meant the types of the arguments, and Arguments meant something else (though I'm not sure what - perhaps the types in a type application?).

Furthermore, it's unclear from the error message that this is a (possible) type inference error. Without that information my first assumption is that it's an actual type error of some kind.

I suggest the following:
1. Put each argument type on its own line, for better readability.
2. Rewrite the text to make it clear what "Types" means.
3. Give a suggestion to the programmer on how to fix the issue - something like "Try adding type annotations to specify the intended types".
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang typed/racket

(map cons (list 1 2 3) (list "foo" "bar" "baz"))
