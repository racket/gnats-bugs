>Description:
We have a project with the following:

* A typed module that provides a structure (call it "baz")
* A typed module that requires the first module and defines functions with arguments using the structure type (call it "bar")
* An untyped top-level module that uses the first and second modules (call it "foo")

Everything works fine in development, but when we go to create a distribution package by using "raco exe" and "raco distrib" we find that on another machine the executable errors out with an error like the following:

default-load-handler: cannot open input file
  path: /home/brian/test-exe/baz.rkt
  system error: No such file or directory; errno=2

and on the local machine, the executable fails to run with:

standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found
  collection: "typed/racket/lang"
  in collection directories:

We're working around it for now by using typed/racket/no-check when building, but it's a bit of a kludge.
>How-To-Repeat:
foo.rkt:

#lang racket

(require "bar.rkt")

(f x)


bar.rkt:

#lang typed/racket

(require "baz.rkt")

(provide: (f (a -> Void)))

(define (f v) (void))

(define x (make-a))

(provide x)



baz.rkt:

#lang typed/racket

(struct: a ())

(provide (struct-out a))
