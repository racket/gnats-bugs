 This is a poor error message (in that there's no error message from TR
 at all), but it turns out that this is a limitation in the contract
 system that we can't do much about.
 
 On git HEAD, there is now a better error message thanks to Eric's
 contract generation improvements:
 
   -> (require/typed racket/base
                     [hasheq (All (a b) (-> (HashTable a b)))])
   ; readline-input:2:26: Type Checker: Type (All (a b) (-> (HashTable a b)))
   ;   could not be converted to a contract: required a flat contract but
   ;   generated an impersonator contract
   ;   in: (All (a b) (-> (HashTable a b)))
   ; [,bt for context]
 
 Though maybe it should say "required a chaperone contract" in this case.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 Hash tables require a flat contract to work on non equal based hash
 tables (eq or eqv), so I believe the new error message is correct.

 Ah, yes you're right. Nevermind then.

Reason>>> On HEAD a better error is now produced by Typed Racket.
Unfortunately this case currently has to be an error.
