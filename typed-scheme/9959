>Description:
The error messages (when a program does 
not type-check) that I get under mzscheme 
provide different information than the 
ones under drscheme.

The two key differences that I describe in
the "Steps to Reproduce" are:

1. DrScheme reports a synthesized type 
as being Number, while MzScheme uses Nat
(a defined alias)

2. DrScheme provides the expression that
the type was synthesized for (and syntax
highlights it).  MzScheme provides no info
about the expression and does not include
any indication of the context of the type
error (not even a line number).


The first issue is confusing and a little 
worrisome, but not serious.  The second issue
makes using typed-scheme from the command
line via mzscheme impractical, which is why
I classified this as severity:serious.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Save the following into the file "bug.ss"

#lang typed-scheme
(define-type-alias Nat Number)
(: advance (Nat -> Integer))
(define (advance time) (+ time 60))

2. Open and run it in DrScheme; the error msg
   is:

typecheck: Expected Integer, but got Number in: (+ time 60)

3. Run it under mzscheme:
% mzscheme bug.ss
typecheck: Expected Integer, but got Nat

Reason>>> These now produce identical error messages.
