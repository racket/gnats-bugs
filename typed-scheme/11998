>Description:
Structures constructed with the same symbolic name are considered to have the same type. This allows for modules to 'break into' supposedly closed structs.

In the example provided below the module p allows construction and destruction of its struct, but p2 only allows construction outside the module. The module m uses p's accessor on values from p2, and gets access to the inner value.

This is related to PR 11859, but in that the problem is the same type has a different symbolic name every compilation.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load
(module p typed/racket
  (struct: (a) p ((v : a)))
  (provide p p-v))

(module p2 typed/racket
  (struct: (a) p ((v : a)))
  (provide p))


(module m typed/racket
  (require (only-in 'p p-v) 'p2)
  (p-v (p 0)))

(require 'm)
