>Description:
I just ran into a flashback of a type error long enough to
make my eyes bleed with the code below.  (In my language
this something like `v' is used to enforce voids in non-tail
expressions.  Changing `Any' to `Number' takes it back to
a fine error, as well as making the body be (+ x 1) or just
dropping the `v' call (where the error is about an expected
Number vs given Any).
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(: v : Void -> Void)
(define (v x) x)

(: foo : Any -> Any)
(define (foo x)
  (v (+ x 1))
  2)
