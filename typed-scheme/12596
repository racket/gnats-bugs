>Description:
I can't find any configuration of for/vector: that 
typechecks in TR. See example below. Result of evaluating
this is:

Type Checker: Error in macro expansion -- insufficient type information to typecheck. please add more type annotations in: (for/vector: : (Vectorof Number) ((i : Natural (in-range 3))) 5)

Again, apologies if I'm doing something dumb; it seems 
like I must be....
