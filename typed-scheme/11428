>Description:
A more precise type for arithmetic-shift would be

    (case-lambda
      (Fixnum (U Negative-Fixnum Zero) -> Fixnum)
      (Natural Integer -> Natural)
      (Integer Integer -> Integer))

The difference is that (Natural Natural -> Natural) is replaced by (Natural Integer -> Natural). Shifting a Natural negatively can't return a negative integer.

(Could also add the case (Nonnegative-Fixnum (U Negative-Fixnum Zero) -> Nonnegative-Fixnum). And possibly (Zero (U Negative-Fixnum Zero) -> Zero) and a few others, if you're feeling frisky.

And can those Negative-Fixnum types in the domain be Negative-Integer instead? I can't use Negative-Integer, but I can't use Negative-Fixnum, either.)
>How-To-Repeat:
TR has enough information to prove that the shift is nonnegative:

> (expt 2 65)
- : Natural
36893488147419103232
> (arithmetic-shift (expt 2 65) -1)
- : Integer
18446744073709551616
> (arithmetic-shift (expt 2 65) -128)
- : Integer
0
