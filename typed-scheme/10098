>Description:
When there are multiple `:'s, the last one wins -- this is an error:

  (: bar : (Number -> Number))
  (: bar : (String -> String))
  (define (bar x)
    (+ x 1))

and this is fine:

  (: bar : (String -> String))
  (: bar : (Number -> Number))
  (define (bar x)
    (+ x 1))

It seems like it might lead to being silent about other typos (eg, you copy
a type declaration, and forget to change the name), so I think that it's better
if it throws an error (maybe even if it's the same type?).

But when there's also `define:' involved, and we're in an internal context, a
bad error is raised:

  (define: (foo) : Number
    (: bar : (Number -> Number))
    (define: (bar [x : Number]) : Number
      (+ x 1))
    (bar 5))
  --> typecheck: Declaration for bar provided, but with no definition in: bar
