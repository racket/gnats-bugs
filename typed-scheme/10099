>Description:
  (: bar : String)
  (define (bar x)
    (+ x 1))
  --> typecheck: untyped var: x in: x

Yes, x is untyped, but I think that it's more important to say that bar is not
supposed to be a function.

[This kind of reminds me of this joke:

A yuppie opened the door of his BMW, when suddenly a car came along and hit the
door, ripping it off completely.  When the police arrived at the scene, the
yuppie was complaining bitterly about the damage to his precious BMW.

"Officer, look what they've done to my Beeeeemer!!!", he whined.

"You yuppies are so materialistic, you make me sick!!!", retorted the officer.
"You're so worried about your stupid BMW, that you didn't even notice that your
left arm was ripped off!!!"

"Oh my gaaawd...," replied the yuppie, finally noticing the bloody left
shoulder where his arm once was, "Where's my Rolex!!!!!"
