>Description:
I have been trying out typed/scheme and getting some weird issuse with rest arguments. I found out that it ignored my annotations of the types of bindings.

Two different annotations both work, this should fail but doesn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/scheme
(define: my-rest : (All (elem) (elem elem * -> (Listof elem)))
  (lambda ( #{ arg : elem} . #{ tail : (Listof elem) }) 
    (rest tail)))
(define: my-rest2 : (All (elem) (elem elem * -> (Listof elem)))
  (lambda ( #{ arg : elem} . #{ tail : elem }) 
    (rest tail)))
