 Thanks, this is a known issue in v6.0.1 and earlier versions of TR.
 
 Basically, TR could not handle Racket functions that already had
 contracts attached. This has been fixed in the pre-release version
 already.
 
 On the current release, you can get around this by using
 `require/typed`, e.g.,
 
   (require/typed racket/format [~v (-> Any String)])
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
