>Description:
in drracket 
typed/racket with submodule
got error 
standard-module-name-resolver: cycle in loading
if compile or load from shell don't have any error
>How-To-Repeat:
write module in typed/racket
like 

#lang typed/racket

(module* main #f
  (define urls-to-download
    (command-line
     #:program "download"
     #:args urls
     urls))
  (for ([url urls-to-download]) 
    (display url)))

and got after compile in drracket

../../../usr/lib64/racket/collects/typed-racket/env/env-req.rkt:9:4: standard-module-name-resolver: cycle in loading
