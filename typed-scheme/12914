>Description:
The return type of seconds->date is a make-Name of an unbound syntax object (I think).

This allows a top level defined structure to match the returned type, and pass type checking.

 This actually looks like a bug in struct:. Normally struct: doesn't
 work at the top level but it does if the struct type has been defined
 as a primitive struct type. Then the system is confused about the real
 representation of the type.

 Yes -- `date` is definitely bound where it's referred to in
 base-env.rkt, but something is causing TR to think that these dates
 are the same.  My initial hypothesis is that the top-level is to
 blame, but I'm not sure how yet.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Sun, 12 Jan 2014 12:50:01 -0500
Reason>>> Appears to be fixed since v5.3.6. Most likely fixed when
`struct:` at the top-level was made to work.
