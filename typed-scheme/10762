>Description:
When I try to open a Modular ACL2 file in DrScheme (built from latest svn), I get a contract error.

The contract error is in terms of poly/c, which is implemented in the unstable collection and used from Typed Scheme.  This may be a bug with DrScheme, Typed Scheme, or poly/c.

Here is the text of the error message:

<collects>/drscheme/private/auto-language.ss: 
  (file
   /Users/cce/svn/2010-02-14/dist/collects/drscheme/private/auto-language.ss)
 broke the contract (poly/c (S32) ...) on pick-new-language; expected a(n) S32; got: #<simple-settings>

>How-To-Repeat:
Install Modular ACL2 [i.e. (planet cce/dracula)], open DrScheme, and try to open a file with the following prefix:

;; The first four lines of this file were added by Dracula.
;; They tell DrScheme that this is a Dracula Modular ACL2 program.
;; Leave these lines unchanged so that DrScheme can properly load this file.
#reader(planet "reader.ss" ("cce" "dracula.plt") "modular" "lang")

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by cce at Sun, 14 Feb 2010 21:19:55 -0500
Reason>>> Type related (determined by investigation and discussion w/ Sam)


State changed from "open" to "suspended" by cce at Sun, 14 Feb 2010 21:40:35 -0500
Reason>>> Switching language to typed-scheme/no-check fixed the bug. 
DrScheme works, but Typed Scheme could use improvement so
this contract can be checked.

 Yes, sorry for not following up by email.  Sam and I found the bug.  I
 checked in a workaround (switching the program to
 typed-scheme/no-check), and Sam will work on the contract soon.

 Looks like a bug in typed scheme, since the code type checks but
 breaks the contract that typed scheme puts in there.
