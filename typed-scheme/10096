>Description:
I think that it would be better to force expressions in `begin's (implicit or not)
to typecheck to Void.  It looks like it won't break Schemely code much more than
already done by TS.

If it's disagreeable, then perhaps at least provide a begin-like macro that expands
to code that requires voids -- so it's possible to easily slap together a language
that does have this feature.  (Well, relatively easy, would be much easier if there
was also some `#%begin' macro, but that's from a different wish list.)

In the meanwhile, is there some hack to achive this now?

 The goal is to break as little code as possible, so I'm not going to
 change this.

 Here's the macro you want:
 
 (define-syntax-rule (begin/void form ... final) (begin (ann form Void)
 ... final))
 
 Note that you'd have to work harder to handle definitions in the `begin'.
