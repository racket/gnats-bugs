>Description:
Printouts on the TR repl have the type too, but toplevel expressions
inside the module are printed without the type.  I'm not sure whether
this is a bug, a change request, or intended -- but it does seem odd
that the two printouts are different...

 This is intended.  `typed/racket' follows `racket' here for printing
 internal module values, and I wouldn't want changing to Typed Racket
 to change the semantics of your program.  The REPL is for interactive
 use, and here I find the types useful.
