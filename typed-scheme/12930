#lang racket/load

(module typed-provider typed/racket
  (provide foo)
  
  (: foo ((Vectorof Integer) -> Integer))
  (define (foo v)
    (printf "~v~n" (vector-ref v 0))
    (vector-ref v 0)))

(require 'typed-provider)
(foo (vector 0 1 2 3))


Running the above produces the following:

'#(0 1 2 3)
foo2: broke its contract
  promised: Integer, produced: '#(0 1 2 3)
  in: the range of
      (-> (vectorof Integer) Integer)
  contract from: typed-provider

 Further info: the vector can be created in TR. So it seems vector-ref 
 fails whenever the vector passes through the contract barrier.
 
 
 #lang racket/load
 
 (module typed-provider typed/racket
    (provide make-vectorof-integer foo)
 
    (: make-vectorof-integer (-> (Vectorof Integer)))
    (define (make-vectorof-integer) (vector 0 1 2 3))
 
    (: foo ((Vectorof Integer) -> Integer))
    (define (foo v)
      (printf "~v~n" (vector-ref v 0))
      (vector-ref v 0)))
 
 (require 'typed-provider)
 (foo (make-vectorof-integer))

 I cannot replicate this at HEAD and I believe the issue was the same
 as what was fixed in:
 https://github.com/plt/racket/commit/aba046a92d42de70a2f777bfbe9a4e75f8e935a9

State changed from "open" to "closed" by stamourv at Wed, 15 Aug 2012 11:37:52 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in git HEAD.
