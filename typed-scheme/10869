>Description:
1. Run the code below as is -- it typecheks fine.

2. Comment out the type declaration for `init' -- complains as it should.

3. Comment out the type declaration for `bogus' -- also complains as it should,
   (but with a bad error message: "Untyped definition : (bogus) in: ..." -- why
   are there parens there?)

4. Now uncomment the `init' declaration back in -- typed scheme lies, it complains
   about: "Duplicate type annotation for init in: init"

5. If instead of a declaration I use `define:', then not only does it stop lying,
   it actually typechecks -- so even the complaint in #2 looks like it shouldn't
   happen.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/scheme

(: bogus : String -> Boolean)
(define bogus ; this machine never accepts!
  (lambda (string)
    (: init : (Listof Symbol) -> Boolean)
    (define (init stream)
      (match stream
        ['() (eq? 'init 'dummy)]
        [(cons 'x more) (init more)]
        [_ #f]))
    (init '(x x x))))
