>Description:
If an (All ...) is not properly parenthesized, instead of an error about that, the error is in terms of unbound type identifiers, and then cascades.  Given that there is only one form of All, any failure to write it correctly should result in a simple error.
>How-To-Repeat:
(: traverse-4 (All (a i) ((BT a) (a ( -> i) ( -> i) -> i) i -> i)))
is fine, but
(: traverse-4 (All (a i) (BT a) (a ( -> i) ( -> i) -> i) i -> i))
says a and i aren't bound, and then the errors cascade.
