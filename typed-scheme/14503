>Description:
The get-flags method of Snip% in typed/racket/gui is expected to produce (List Symbol), when it should be expected to produce (Listof Symbol).  Either that or the docs are wrong.  
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(require typed/racket/gui)
(define my-snip% : (Class #:implements Snip%)
  (class snip% (super-new)
    (define/override (get-flags) '())))
