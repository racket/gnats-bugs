>Description:
Substructures of polymorphic structures don't seem to
work.  Once a substructure is created, the superstructure
accessors cannot be applied.

For example:

(define-struct: (A) u ([x : A]))
(define-struct: (A) (v u) ())
(make-v 5)

There is, as far as I can tell, no way to extract the
5 at this point.  This will work fine if the structure
is monomorphic, but even instantiating the polymorphic
structure will not help.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed-scheme
(define-struct: s ([x : Integer]))
(define-struct: (t s) ())

(s-x (make-t 5)) ;; OK

(define-struct: (A) u ([x : A]))
(define-struct: (A) (v u) ())

(u-x (make-v 5)) ;; Not OK
({inst u-x Integer} (make-v 5)) ;; Still not OK
({inst u-x Integer} ({inst make-v Integer} 5)) ;; Still not OK

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by samth at Wed, 12 Aug 2009 18:33:47 -0400
Reason>>> the latter two examples now work


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by samth at Wed, 19 May 2010 11:57:15 -0400
Reason>>> the final example won't be fixed without new research
