>Description:
The code below throws an error saying:

  typecheck: Expected result with filter (| Bot Bot) and no object,
  got filter (| Bot) and no object in: (quote 0)

which looks like something internal that shouldn't come out in an error
message.

BTW#1,
- the same definition with only one argument works, and assigns `foo' a
  type of (Any -> Integer : (| LBot)),
- with a one-argument identity function the type is
    (Any -> Any : ((! #f @ () 0) | (#f @ () 0)) (0)),
  and this works also for any number of arguments where the first is
  returned:
    (define (foo a b c) a)
- with multiple arguments where something other than the first is returned,
  for example:
    (define (foo a b c) c)
  I get an error:
    ...plt/collects/scheme/match/runtime.ss:19:0: match: no matching clause
    for (2)
- but things are fine again for
    (define (foo a b c) (list c))

BTW#2, it would be nice if it infers some generic Any type for all of
these.  It looks like this is what it's trying to do in general.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed-scheme
(define (foo a b) 0)
