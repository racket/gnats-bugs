>Description:
If you run the example code below:

  #lang racket
  
  (module a racket
    (struct point (x y))
    (provide (struct-out point)))
  
  (module b typed/racket
    (require/typed (submod ".." a)
                   [struct point ([x : Integer] [y : Integer])])
    (point 3 2))

the following error is produced:
 module: identifier is already imported in: point

If you add something like
  #:constructor-name make-point

to the struct type declaration, you get a different error:
  point3: bad syntax;
   identifier for static struct-type information cannot be used as an expression in: point3

Looking at the macro stepper output, it looks like two
conflicting #%require statements are generated: one for the struct type
information and one for the constructor that both use the
same binding.

NB: this isn't a submodule-related problem. I just used
submodules to make the example easier to run. You get the same
error if you put them in separate files.

 I cannot replicate the first issue at HEAD or at the commit you
 submitted the bug at. Can you still replicate it?
 
 The second issue is a problem in your program. If you supply
 #:constructor-name, then the struct name cannot be used as the
 constructor. You get the same error message if you are in racket and
 not in TR.

 As of commit 0c6734f782867b0401db15eb687fd246552e17b5, I still see the
 error. Oddly, it only appears in DrRacket.
