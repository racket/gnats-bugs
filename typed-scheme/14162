>Description:
This is probably to be filed in some dusty wishlist: looks like there
is no case in `abs's type with a small possibly-negative integer on
the LHS and a small positive one on the RHS.  This means that in some
cases (such as one that I ran into) there is no way to translate code
that uses negativeness as a flag, which means changing the code which
can change an algorithm.

(Yes, such things are better solved with things like structs etc, but
if I'm trying to change some code to TR to buy me more CPU cycles then
I definitely don't want to do such things...)

It would be nice to have something like "a Fixnum, but not the most negative one", but I can imagine the pain of adding yet another
numeric type...

 If there was something like an abs : Negative-Index -> Positive-Fixnum
 case, would that have helped?

 There's no `Negative-Index' type (the concept of a negative index
 doesn't make much sense, so we decided against adding the type).
 
 Adding that type (or something like `Fixnum-But-Not-Most-Negative')
 would be possible (and would solve this problem), but I'm not sure the
 extra complexity would be worth it.
 
 Eli: `fxabs' should have the type you want. Since it errors when given a
 non-fixnum, it has more precise return types.
