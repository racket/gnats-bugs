>Description:
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at the second example for require/typed. It looks like this:
Examples:
> (require/typed racket/base
                 [#:opaque Evt evt?]
                 [alarm-evt (Real -> Evt)]
                 [sync (Evt -> Any)])
eval:51:0: Type Checker: Type (-> Real Error) could not be
converted to a contract: contract generation not supported
for this type
  in: (Real -> Evt)
> evt?
eval:51:0: Type Checker: parse error in type;
 type name `Evt' is unbound
  in: Evt
> (sync (alarm-evt (+ 100 (current-inexact-milliseconds))))
- : (Rec x (Evtof x))
#<alarm-evt>
