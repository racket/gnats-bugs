>Description:
Any value can be given the type (Rec alpha alpha).
A value with type (Rec alpha alpha) can in turn be given any type.
This leads to either non-termination of the type checker 
or the validation of programs which cause runtime type errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(: x (Rec alpha alpha))
(define x 1)

; type checker doesn't terminate
(x 0)
(x x)

; type checks and blows up at runtime
((ann x (Any -> Any)) 0)
(car x)
