>Description:
Comment out (crash 3.0) in the program below, and it works. The problem is apparently the optimizer assuming that the result of (sqrt x) is always complex, which is not true.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(: real-float-sqrt (Float -> Float))
(define (real-float-sqrt x)
  (exact->inexact (real-part (sqrt x))))

(real-float-sqrt 3.0)

(: crash (Float -> Float))
(define (crash x)
  (real-part (exact->inexact (sqrt x))))

(crash 3.0)
