>Description:
The following typed racket program:

(define c%
  (class object%
    (super-new)
    (: f (-> Integer))
    (define (f) 5)))

Produces the type checker errors:
 Type Checker: missing type for identifier;
 consider adding a type annotation with `:'
  identifier: f4 in: (define (f) 5)
. Type Checker: missing type for identifier;
 consider adding a type annotation with `:'
  identifier: f3 in: (f)

But if we modify the program slightly to

(define c%
  (class object%
    (super-new)
    (: f (-> Integer))
    (define/private (f) 5)))

Then the type errors go away. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang typed/racket

(define c%
  (class object%
    (super-new)
    (: f (-> Integer))
    (define (f) 5)))

  | Fix typed private class fields with functions
  | 
  | A public method definition and a private field that contains
  | a function are hard to distinguish without traversing the entire
  | class body, which caused TR to fail to detect the private field
  | case. TR now uses more compile-time state to precisely
  | distinguish the cases.
  | 
  | Also fixes a related bug in which TR would incorrectly handle
  | multiple private fields defined with a single `define-values`.
  | 
  | Closes PR 14788
