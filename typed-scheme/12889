The presence of polymorphism makes non-polymorphic, mutable containers harder to use.

(: foo ((Vectorof Index) -> (Vectorof Index)))
(define (foo xs) xs)

(: bar (All (A) ((Vectorof Index) -> (Vectorof Index))))
(define (bar xs) xs)


The only difference between `foo' and `bar' is that `bar' has a type argument (which is unused). In the REPL:

> (foo (vector 1))
- : (Vectorof Index)
'#(1)
> (bar (vector 1))
Type Checker: Polymorphic function bar could not be applied to arguments:
Argument 1:
  Expected: (Vectorof Index)
  Given:    (Vector Integer)
 in: (bar (vector 1))

Reason>>> This is (yet another) instance of a general issue, which is
that the type inference engine doesn't use formal argument
type information when checking arguments to polymorphic
functions.  This is why you have to annotate your lambdas
that you pass to `map`, as well.
