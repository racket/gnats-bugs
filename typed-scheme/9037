>Description:
typed-scheme doesn't parse symbolic-literal types (e.g., 'foo) correctly.

It appears that this is because `Vectorof' does not 
appear in the literals list in `parse-type' in private/parser-type.ss.  (Thanks to Felix Klock for finding this.)

Oh, and the ability to use symbolic literals as types isn't documented.  The manual lists only numbers, booleans, and string literals.
>How-To-Repeat:
Module language.  Put the following in the definitions window and execute.

  (module foo (planet "typed-scheme.ss" ("plt" "typed-scheme.plt" 2 (= 0)))
  
    (define: (f [x : (U 'red 'green 'blue)]) : Number
      (case x
        [(red) 1]
        [(green) 2]
        [(blue) 3])))

You get the error message

  typecheck: unbound type red in: red

and the occurrence of `red' on the third line (in f's header) is highlighted.
