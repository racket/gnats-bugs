>Description:
https://github.com/plt/racket/commit/844e898a548ea3b8fcecb97b0e59f8dcf06e0949 changed how this code worked but didn't fully test the new code paths, and so they do not work at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module a typed/racket
  (provide foo)
  (: foo
     (case-> 
       (Number String * -> Number)
       (Number String String * -> Number)))
  (define (foo x . args) x))

(require 'a)
(foo 3 "x")
