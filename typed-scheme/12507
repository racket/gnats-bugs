>Description:
A student tried to use (inst + Number), and got a huge error message that named the (beginning of) the full type as the offending error.  This is bad, since the source code of the error is just `+', so it would be way better to just say something like

  Type Checker: Cannot instantiate non-polymorphic type of `+'

in that case.
