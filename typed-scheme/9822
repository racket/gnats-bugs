 What would the type of `sqrt' be?

 Indeed, we should probably work out the whole numeric tower. -- Matthias

 Number -> Complex, maybe; I'm not sure but that's irrelevant.  (That
 one seems reasonable enough, forcing you to check that the result is
 not a complex number if you want a Number.)  (Or alternatively, it can
 be (U (NonNegativeNumber -> Number) (Number -> Complex)).)
 
 The point of the report is that (denominator 1+2i) throws a (mzscheme)
 type error that could be avoided.

 The problem here is that if you have NonNegativeNumber, your hierarchy
 is now a DAG, not a tree, and so either you need some special-case
 logic, or you need a very large number of different numeric types.

 Yes, of course.  I see that I omitted some indication that this sounds
 like it has some use, but probably impractical.  (And going back to
 the swindle analogy, I had a similar kind of decisions to do...)
