>Description:
In section 4.8.2 of the Typed Scheme docs, entitled "Non-Uniform Variable-Arity Functions", the map function doesn't pass the type checker. It's complex enough that I (a beginner) can't figure out how to fix it, either, so that section of the docs becomes impenetrable.

A cursory search indicates that this may be a known bug (as of almost a year ago at least) ... if the example isn't even *intended* to work, please note that somewhere in the docs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the map example:

(: map
   (All (C A B ...)
        ((A B ... B -> C) (Listof A) (Listof B) ... B
         ->
         (Listof C))))
(define (map f as . bss)
  (if (or (null? as)
          (ormap null? bss))
      null
      (cons (apply f (car as) (map car bss))
            (apply map f (cdr as) (map cdr bss)))))

 We'll change it to an example that works -- the circularity in the
 definition is getting in the way here.
