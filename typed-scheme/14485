>Description:
When I make a function that returns (plot ...) and annotate it to produce (U Void (Instance Snip%)), then it gives this error:
. Type Checker: type mismatch
  expected: (U Void (Instance Snip%))
  given: (U Void (Instance Snip%)) in: (plot (axes))
I think plot/typed is getting it's Snip% type from somewhere other than where I'm getting it (from typed/racket/gui).  

Fixing it should be as simple as putting a (require typed/racket/gui) in there somewhere instead of whatever it's using now.

 Thanks for the report. This is a known issue that won't be fixed quite
 yet, but it's being worked on.
 
 Basically, some of these types from typed/racket/gui don't currently
 compile well to contracts (takes way too much time). Because of that,
 I've avoided using those types in other libraries until it's more ready.
 
 I have a proposed pull request that solves the time part of it, but it
 has other problems that I need to fix before it gets merged.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
