(: foo ((HashTable Integer Symbol) -> (HashTable Symbol Integer)))
(define (foo map)
  (for/hash: : (HashTable Symbol Integer) ([(i s) map])
             (values s i)))

gives me the error:

for/hash:: There were multiple syntax errors. The first error follows:
expected identifier
  at: (i s)
  in: (for/hash: : (HashTable Symbol Integer) (((i s) map)) (values s i))

... which does not seem right.

 One thing we can quickly do to improve the situation is to add a type
 for `in-hash-pairs` to Typed Racket, which would let you express the
 above with an extra destructuring of the key/value pair.
 
 Other TR devs: is it really necessary to restrict `for:` iteration to
 single values syntactically?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 As long as we have cases where it works and the error messages are
 good, I'm fine with it.

 When I first wrote the `for:' macros, multi-valued sequence clauses
 would trigger internal errors in the typechecker, so I disabled them.
 
 I just tried enabling them. I don't get an internal error anymore, but
 it seems inference can't cope with the expansion.
