>Description:
Normal racket says that the identifier is undefined, but TR says that it is untyped. I think it should give the undefined message instead, because that is the actual problem.

Reason>>> Disagree with my former self, this is working as intended (unbound 
identifiers are a runtime issue) and we shouldn't rule them out 
statically so that recursive definitions work.
