>Description:
The docs for type constructors in the typed racket reference mention the form (dom ... rest * -> rng) where dom is allowed to be a type, keyword type, or [keyword type], but the later two cases do not seem to actually be supported. For example the following two types give a bad syntax error from the type checker.

(: foo (#:start Integer Integer * -> Integer))

and

(: bar ([#:start Integer] Integer * -> Integer))
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to run the following typed racket program

#lang typed/racket

(: foo (#:start Integer Integer * -> Integer))
(define (foo #:start start . rest)
  (+ start (apply + rest)))

(: bar ([#:start Integer] Integer * -> Integer))
(define (bar #:start [start 0] . rest)
  (+ start (apply + rest)))

;; Produces Type Checker: ->: bad syntax
