>Description:
I cannot annotate the types of anything using typed/srfi/14 because it does not export Char-Set (or Cursor).

Also, something seems to be wrong, I get strange artifacts from the contract system when I refer to the typed/srfi/14 functions.  See the program below, try it in the definitions window as well as with the expression in the interactions window.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed-scheme
;; This is for the second problem.
;; There is no code to write for the first.
char-set?
