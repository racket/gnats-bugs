>Description:
Typed-Racket's require/typed form has poor interaction with prefix-in.  See below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save the following two modules as untyped.rkt and typed.rkt respectively:

#lang racket

(struct foo (bar baz))
(define f (lambda (x) (+ (foo-baz x) 3)))

(provide [struct-out foo]
         f)

#lang typed/racket

(require/typed (prefix-in U: "untyped.rkt")
               [struct U:foo ([bar : Number] [baz : String])]
               [U:f (U:foo -> Number)])

Load typed.rkt into DrRacket and hit Execute.  Resulting error:

    only-in: identifier `struct:U:foo' not included in nested require spec in: (prefix-in U: "untyped.rkt")

If you require untyped.rkt without the prefix and get rid of the U: elsewhere in the module, then it works (well, where "works" means "results in an unrelated error message that is the subject of the bug report I'll file just after this one.")
