The following program should typecheck but it doesn't. If the version of ab? is replaced with the commented version, it passes.

(define-type abc (U 'a 'b'c))

(: ab? (abc -> Boolean))

 Unfortunately, if you look at the expansion you'll see that they're
 totally different, and the one that doesn't work is much more complex
 from the typechecker's point of view.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Thu, 21 Nov 2013 00:20:34 -0500
Reason>>> Both versions now type-check in Racket v5.90.0.11.
