>Description:
It should always be safe to use a rest arg that has a dotted pre-type as if it were a list of such elements where the dotted type variable is replaced with Any.  However, in the program given in the steps to reproduce, Typed Scheme doesn't seem to coerce the type appropriately.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang typed-scheme

(: funny (All (a ...) ((Listof a) ... -> (Listof Any))))

(define (funny . b)
 (map car b))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Wed, 18 Aug 2010 09:56:43 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed.  An `inst' is required for `car', but that's expected.
