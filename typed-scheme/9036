>Description:
typed-scheme.plt v 2.0.

The language level is broken; see below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.  Change the language level to Typed Scheme.  Hit F5 to execute the (empty) definitions window.  You'll get the following error in the interactions window:

    compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound

If you then type an expression like (+ 3 4) in the definitions window and hit F5, you get the following in the interactions window:

    compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound
    compile: bad syntax; reference to top-level identifier is not allowed, because no #%top syntax transformer is bound in: #%top-interaction
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "samth" by eli at Fri, 09 May 2008 15:26:17 -0400
Reason>>> typed scheme


State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Fri, 09 May 2008 15:29:37 -0400
Reason>>> now in collects, and no more language level
