>Description:
This is a known bug, but I'm reporting it so there's a record of it.

The following snippet is unsafe:

;;;

#lang racket

(module foo typed/racket
  (struct: Foo ([f : (Flonum -> Flonum)])
    #:property prop:procedure
    (struct-field-index f))
  
  (define a-foo (Foo (Î» (x) (* x 2))))
  (provide a-foo))

(require 'foo)
(a-foo '(1 2 3))

;;;

The result on my machine is 2.9643938750475e-323. You can get
similar results with #:methods and probably other keywords.
