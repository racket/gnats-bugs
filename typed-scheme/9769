 This works for me. I put your code in the module language and prefixed it with
 
   #lang scheme
 
 Perhaps you were using it elsewhere?

 Sounds like Greg has a problem with typed Scheme.  I tried this:
 
   #lang typed-scheme
   (: check-token (Any Any * -> Boolean))
   (define (check-token str . toks)
     (if (null? toks)
         #t
         (and (let ([tok (car toks)]) tok) #t)))
 
 and got an error about `tok' being unbound.
 
 (I got another error which looks like a drschem problem, I'll file
 separately.)
