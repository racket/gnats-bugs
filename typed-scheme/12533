>Description:
Run the code below, and get two type errors that show several
problems:

1. It talks about `hash-set'.  This breaks the usual rule of having
   good error messages.  It should at least see that the identifier
   is coming from a different source and say that it's a result of
   macro expansion.

2. It's yet another case where the first type error is bogus: it uses
   `a' and `b' in a way that matches fine.  Such errors are always bad
   and it would be nice if instead of throwing them it would figure
   that out and throw some "internal error" or "unimplemented" in
   there instead.

3. The second type error:

     Expected (HashTable String Integer),
     but got (HashTable Integer Integer)

   is very wrong.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(: foo : -> (HashTable String Integer))
(define (foo)
  (for/hash: : (HashTable String Integer)
             ([n : Integer (in-list '(1 2 3))])
    (values "x" n)))
