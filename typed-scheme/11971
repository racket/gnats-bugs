>Description:
The following program shows how when a typed module imports a structure type with prop:procedure, it behaves incorrectly. It assumes that function 'procedure?' returns false when working on instances of the structure type, even though it does return true at runtime.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load

(module a racket
  (provide (struct-out foo))
  (define-struct foo (proc) #:property prop:procedure (struct-field-index proc)))

(module b typed/racket
  (require/typed 'a
                 (struct foo ((proc : (Number Number -> Number)))))
  (define f (make-foo +))
  (procedure? f)
  (let () ;To hide incorrect optimization at module level (Fixed in HEAD)
    (if (procedure? f) #t #f))) 

(require 'b)
