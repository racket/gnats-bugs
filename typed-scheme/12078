>Description:
If I define a non-uniform variadic function, variadic-curry, and try to alias it with a new definition, it only works if I don't eta-abstract the definition. I get the following suspicious error message:

Type Checker: Polymorphic function variadic-curry could not be applied to arguments:
Argument 1:
  Expected: (a b ... b -> c)
  Given:    (a b ... b -> c)

Result type:     (a -> (b ... b -> c))
Expected result: (a -> (b ... b -> c))
>How-To-Repeat:
The third and fourth definitions in the following code will not typecheck:

#lang typed/racket

;; the original function
(: variadic-curry (All (c a b ...) ((a b ... b -> c) -> (a -> b ... b -> c))))
(define (variadic-curry f)
  (λ (fst) (λ rest (apply f fst rest))))

;; the first alias - this works
(: variadic-curry2 (All (c a b ...) ((a b ... b -> c) -> (a -> b ... b -> c))))
(define variadic-curry2
  variadic-curry)

;; the second alias (eta-abstracted) - this fails
(: variadic-curry3 (All (c a b ...) ((a b ... b -> c) -> (a -> b ... b -> c))))
(define variadic-curry3
  (λ (f) (variadic-curry f)))

;; this equivalent alias also fails
(: variadic-curry4 (All (c a b ...) ((a b ... b -> c) -> (a -> b ... b -> c))))
(define (variadic-curry4 f)
  (variadic-curry f))

Reason>>> tr


State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Tue, 01 Jul 2014 17:34:03 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed by recent commits. Cannot reproduce on the latest
Racket from git. Reproducible on v6.0.1 and older.
