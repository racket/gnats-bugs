>Description:
Re: http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/quick.html, though it's stated that The Typed Racket "guide is intended for programmers familiar with Racket", practical considerations behoove the inclusion of the three lines needed to run the example program.  E.g.,

(define: pt1 : pt (pt 5.2 2.5))
(define: pt2 : pt (pt 2.5 5.2))
(distance pt1 pt2)

http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/doc-index.html#alpha:S doesn't have a "struct" entry.  All keywords discussed in a document should, ideally, be included in its index.

http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/index.html should introduce its subject with more than a sentence. Please mention e.g. how much of the untyped Racket language is available in Typed Racket.

Thank you
