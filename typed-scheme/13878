>Description:
Consider the following example:

#lang typed/racket
(require (for-syntax typed/racket))
(begin-for-syntax
  (: g (String -> Symbol))
  (define (g x) (* x 3.2)))

This is clearly ill-typed, but TR does not complain.

At the REPL, you can get an internal error:

> (begin-for-syntax g)
. . ..\..\Program Files\Racket\collects\typed-racket\utils\tc-utils.rkt:154:0: Internal Typechecker Error: bad type result: #<void>

 BTW, this actually has the same root cause as PR 14030 (`make-predicate`
 at the top-level). The #<void> use here is pretty fishy.
 
 A short-term fix is to add `begin-for-syntax` to the `invis-kw` syntax
 class in tc-setup.rkt, which probably should be done anyway. The
 long-term fix is to refactor tc-toplevel.rkt.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu
