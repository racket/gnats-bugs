>Description:
Consider the following interaction:

-> (: f ([#:foo Any] -> (Option Natural)))
-> (define (f #:foo x) 0)
; readline-input:3:0: Type Checker: Expected a function of type (case-> (Any
;   True -> (U Natural False)) (False False -> (U Natural False))), but got a
;   function with the wrong arity
;   in: (define (f #:foo x) 0)
; [,bt for context]

I had no idea what this error message meant until I tried
a few things and figured out that the problem was that the
type says the keyword is optional, but the function has a
mandatory keyword argument.

  | Check function kws against expected before tc-expr
  | 
  | This checks that the given lambda has the right keywords
  | wrt to the expected type. Doing this should avoid the bad
  | arity errors that result from the kw protocol encoding.

  | Closes PR 13898
