  | Fix `possible-domains' function in TR internals
  | 
  | This fixes type error message generation in some cases
  | and also the `query-type/result` command on multiple
  | valued functions.
  | 
  | The latter still does not allow multiple return type
  | queries (TODO) but it won't crash now.
  | 
  | Closes PR 14493
