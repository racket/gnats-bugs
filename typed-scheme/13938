>Description:
The `eof-evt` binding (and all other events from racket/port) in
Typed Racket has a type in the base type environment, but cannot
actually be used (in DrRacket or at the cmdline REPL).

It appears that this is because `eof-evt` has a contract attached
to it in racket/port. Surprisingly, it appears none of the other
bindings in TR's base environment have contracts!

This isn't unique to events. If you add a contract to a random
function exported from racket/port, the result is the same.

Example below:

-> eof-evt
; readline-input:1:0: Type Checker: untyped top-level identifier lifted.0
;   in: eof-evt
; [,bt for context]
-> ,syntax eof-evt
; Syntax set
-> ,syntax !
; expand ->
; (begin
    (define-values
     (lifted.2)
     (#%app
      apply-contract
      provide/contract-contract-id-eof-evt
      eof-evt
      pos-module-source
      (#%app
       module-name-fixup
       (#%app variable-reference->module-source/submod (#%variable-reference))
       (#%app list))
      'eof-evt
      (#%app make-srcloc '"<collects>/racket/port.rkt" '82 '12 '3382 '7)))
    (#%expression (#%top . lifted.2)))
