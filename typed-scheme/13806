It would be good if typed/racket's error message for the example program below would point to the clause containing the binding for 'y' instead of the entire let: expression, which is what it does now.

 I looked into this a bit and tried to refactor the syntax-parse grammar
 but had no results. After asking Ryan about it, it sounds like it may be
 a `syntax-parse` limitation, so I've re-assigned the PR to him.
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 BTW, for the PR transcript: I did tweak the order of some parse clauses
 in the `let:` macro to get a slightly better error.
 
   Welcome to Racket v5.90.0.9.
   -> (let: loop ([x : Integer 1] [y : Boolean]) x)
   ; readline-input:1.0: let:: expected more terms starting with expression
   ;   at: ()
   ;   in: (let: loop ((x : Integer 1) (y : Boolean)) x)
   ;   parsing context:
   ;    while parsing annotated-binding
   ;     term: (y : Boolean)
   ;     location: readline-input:1.28
   ;    while parsing optionally type-annotated binding
   ;     term: (y : Boolean)
   ;     location: readline-input:1.28
   ; [,bt for context]
 
 (note parsing context)
 
 It still needs work though, to get the highlight right. Also, setting #:opaque
 on one of the syntax classes gave me a different, but likely not better,
 error message:
 
   Welcome to Racket v5.90.0.9.
   -> (let: loop ([x : Integer 1] [y : Boolean]) x)
   ; readline-input:1.0: let:: unexpected term
   ;   at: Boolean
   ;   in: (let: loop ((x : Integer 1) (y : Boolean)) x)
   ;   parsing context:
   ;    while parsing optionally type-annotated binding
   ;     term: (y : Boolean)
   ;     location: readline-input:1.28
   ; [,bt for context]
