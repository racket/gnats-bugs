>Description:
There isn't much documentation about when to use 'require' and when to use 'require/typed' in Typed Racket. From talking to people, it sounds like the general advice is "use require, and if that doesn't work, use require/typed". At least that much should probably be written down somewhere in the Typed Racket Guide, possibly along with a more detailed explanation.

In general, there also isn't much explanation of how typed and untyped code interact (which is a big part of the whole idea). Yes, ideally it should "just work" and the programmer shouldn't have to care, but for those times when they do, it's a good idea to have documentation saying that untyped code will be wrapped in contracts, etc.

 Thanks for the report.

 Do you think a new subsection in section 3 would be sufficient? I think
 the more nuanced advice that we can give is "use require if you are
 importing from a typed module, and use require/typed if you are
 importing from an untyped module".

 Maybe then a separate section titled "Typed-Untyped Interaction" would
 be better?

 I think a separate "Typed/Untyped Interaction" section might be better, but
 it doesn't have to be very long. Probably just a paragraph or two
 explaining the general idea of how it works (wrapping values in contracts,
 etc.), and then maybe two subsections: one for using typed code from
 untyped code, and one for using untyped code from typed code. Even if the
 answer for either of those sections is "it should just work without you
 changing anything", I think it's useful to have that written down.

 I've made a first attempt at this and pushed it. I've put the section up
 here so you can read it without building HEAD:

 I like it. My one note is that if there's a discussion elsewhere in the
 Racket docs of the effect of contracts on performance, it would be helpful
 to link to it in the caveat section.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by asumu at Wed, 31 Jul 2013 14:01:46 -0400
Reason>>> TR Guide now has a section for this. The Racket Guide 
should maybe eventually include a section on contract 
performance tips.
