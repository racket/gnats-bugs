>Description:
From a few test cases, it seems the most precise type for `sgn' (given the current primitive types) is

       (case-lambda
         (Zero -> Zero)
         (Exact-Positive-Integer -> Positive-Fixnum)
         (Exact-Nonnegative-Integer -> Nonnegative-Fixnum)
         (Exact-Rational -> Fixnum)
         (Float -> Float)
         (Inexact-Real -> Inexact-Real)
         (Real -> Real))
>How-To-Repeat:
> sgn
- : (Real -> Real)
#<procedure:sgn>
