>Description:
Using ... in a quasi pattern in match, in typed/racket, causes a type error with a variable which does not arise in the program.

In the program in Steps to Redproduce, the error is
Type Checker: Error in macro expansion -- untyped variable: parse-loop12 in: (match (quote (1 2 3)) ((quasiquote ((unquote a) (unquote b) ...)) (list b a)))

Where parse-loop12 isn't in the program and the entire match expression is highlighted as the source, so it's hard to figure out which part can't type.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket

(match '(1 2 3)
  (`(,a ,b ... ) (list b a)))

 and quasi patterns in match

 Two things:
 
 1. To fix this, you need to have both an expected type for the entire
 `match' expression and annotate the binding of `b' with its type,
 perhaps (Listof Number).
 2.  Since the error is in generated code, there's no way for TR to
 highlight something more specific.  Would you prefer that the error
 message has less information? (That's a serious question.) I could
 take out the "untyped variable: parse-loop12" bit.
