>Description:
In the example code given,
no matter what the semantics of the annotation on square in the
provide: clause, at least one of these three should have failed:
- type-checking of square.ss
- type-checking of squareclient.ss
- execution of squareclient.ss

(I'd prefer the first or the second over the third.)

But NONE of them fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
Module square.ss:

---
#lang typed-scheme

(provide: [square (Integer -> Integer)])

(define: (square [n : Number]) : Number
 (* n n))
---

Module squareclient.ss:

---
#lang typed-scheme

(require "square.ss")

(square 10)  ;; 100
(integer? 10.1)  ;; #f
(square 10.1)  ;; 102.009999...
