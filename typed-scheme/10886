 This is the error message for any identifier from `scheme' which
 doesn't have a type.  I'll add a type for `vector-argmax', but I'm not
 sure what to change in the error message.

 You have two choices:=20
 
  -- assign types=20
  -- don't import them=20
 
 But don't tell me you import it and it isn't typed. That's awful.=20

 If you had gotten the error:
 
 expand: unbound variable `vector-argmax'
 
 wouldn't you have thought that you had spelled it wrong, or that it
 wasn't part of `scheme', or something like that?  I would expect users
 to be more confused by that.

 would be the absolutely ideal error message.=20
 
 The idea would be if it all just worked.=20

 First, referring to the maintainer by name would obviously not be the
 ideal message.  Second, this message makes no sense - if the variable
 is unbound, then which identifier was I supposed to assign a type to.
 
 Would you have preferred if the original message said `scheme' instead
 of `typed/scheme'.

 There are 1787 names bound on Racket startup.  Patches are welcome to
 finish the job.
