>Description:
Can't require/typed a struct defined with define-struct either.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save following as untyped.rkt & typed.rkt respectively:

#lang racket

(define-struct foo (bar baz))
(define f (lambda (x) (+ (foo-baz x) 3)))

(provide [struct-out foo]
         f)

#lang typed/racket

(require/typed "untyped.rkt"
               [struct foo ([bar : Number] [baz : String])]
               [f (foo -> Number)])

Execute typed.rkt.  Resulting error:

reference to an identifier before its definition: foo?

and DrRacket highlights the occurrence of "foo" in the [struct ...] clause under the require/typed.

If you add a clause for foo? to the require/typed form
    [foo? (Any -> Boolean)]
DrRacket instead complains of a "duplicate definition for identifier in: foo?"

 A bit of advice - writing bug reports like this is much easier to do
 using #lang racket/load, and it makes it much easier on me to
 reproduce them and add test cases too.
 
 Thanks for the report,
