>Description:
If you use a define: w/ the type variable syntax -- eg,

(define: (a b) (tmap [abt : (BT a)] [f : (a -> b)]) : (BT b) ...)

and there is an error (eg, forget to annotate abt -- have just the variable name, as in regular define), TS gives an error in terms of "pdefine:", which is not a documented name.

In general, I wish type errors weren't prefaced by "typecheck", which is presumably some internal function name.  Something like "Type error" would be more proper prose.

 No, 'typecheck' is intentionally there as a prefix.
 `raise-syntax-error' expects a symbol there, so it's not easy to do
 better here, but I'll try.
