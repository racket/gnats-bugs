>Description:
The program given below fails to run because of the error:

S: illegal use of syntax in: (S 5)

Changing the language of module a to typed/racket/no-check or changing b to typed/racket fixes the problem.  The program also passes "Check Syntax" with no errors, although nothing is highlighted in the code (so maybe "Check Syntax" doesn't understand racket/load?).
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load
(module a typed/racket
  (struct: S ((x : Integer)) #:transparent)
  (provide (all-defined-out)))
(module b typed/racket/no-check
  (require 'a)
  (S 5))

 Check Syntax indeed can't do anything with `racket/load'.
