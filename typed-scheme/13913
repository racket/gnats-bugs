 Probably the reason that we didn't know about this earlier is that the TR
 tests aren't compiled? Maybe time to compile them?

 I fixed the deps. Robby what do you mean by 'the TR tests aren't
 compiled'? Is this some setting of DrDr?

 In the past we would routinely a add info.rkt file annotations that told
 raco setup to not compile test case files. Many of these went away when we
 made the transition to pkgs but maybe not all.
 
 And if files aren't compiled the dependency checked won't work (it looks at
 files generated by the compilation process).

 Since you and Sam both think that we should be compiling this now (and
 I agree), I'm trying to make that happen. Given that DrDr wasn't
 complaining I don't think that it was working because I just fixed the
 last dependency yesterday. Can you point me to these info
 files/pointers on how to set this up?

 The way I'm familiar with people doing this is having definitions of
 "compile-omit-files" in info.rkt files.
 
 But you can run 'raco setup' and the see if you get the right files in the
 compiled/ directory. And if you can't figure out why in some cases, that
 they aren't there, then ask.
