>Description:
I get the following error message from the following program.

type-check: type name used out of context
  in: (Natural val)
  context...:
   success
   /Users/endobson/proj/racket/plt/collects/typed-racket/typed-racket.rkt:38:4
   standard-module-name-resolver

I expect to get a source location on the error message, and I also don't expect the error message to include syntax that isn't in the source program.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
