 It looks like this is actually done intentionally. In `tc-setup.rkt`,
 the keyword `begin` is set to be ignored for printing the type (by being
 included in the `invis-kw` syntax class).
 
 Is there a good reason to ignore these `begin`s?
 
 Cheers,
 Asumu

 From my read of the history, Typed Racket has been doing this since it
 was a planet package.
 
 I think the reason is because there's no typed for `(begin (require
 ...))` or `(begin (define ...))`.  It could just be smarter here, I
 think.

  | Adjust handling of types for non-expressions
  | 
  | Some forms like `define` do not produce a value
  | and thus do not have a type. Instead of returning
  | the #<void> value for these cases, return the symbol
  | 'no-type.
  | 
  | Also fix printing in several places to reflect this.
  | 
  | Fixes a regression due to commit 00470e3 and also
  | fixes an unreported bug with (:print-type ...) on
  | non-expressions.
  | 
  | Closes PR 13758
