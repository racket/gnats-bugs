>Description:
The program given in the "Steps to Reproduce" section of the bug report produces an assertion failure (as it should), but the error is reported as being inside Racket.  The error I get is:

Applications/Racket v5.1/collects/racket/private/map.rkt:18:11: Assertion failed

Clicking the stack trace button gives only that frame as well (with nothing that points to my program).
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program:

#lang typed/racket
(map (lambda: ((x : (Option Integer))) (assert x)) '(#f))

 What happens if the program is just:
 
 (assert #f)
 
 ?

 I get "Assertion failed" without a source location.

 I am able to make this program give both the desired behavior and the observed behavior by changing whether or not Debugging is enabled in the Choose Language dialog. If it is enabled I get the nice stack trace, and if it is disabled I don't. This is on HEAD; on 5.1.1, I always get the observed (bad) behavior.

 This now works properly if "Debugging" is on in DrRacket.  Otherwise,
 we're at the mercy of the optimizer/stack, and nothing is guaranteed
 about source location.
