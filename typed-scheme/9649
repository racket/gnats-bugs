>Description:
The typed-scheme documentation claims that the `require/typed' form accepts an optionally-renamed identifier, but the implementation doesn't appear to support this behavior.

Further, the error reporting logic in the implementation of require/typed seems to have some problems.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the definitions window, module language:

    #lang typed-scheme

    (require/typed srfi/67 [(char-compare s67:char-compare) (Char Char -> Integer)])

Upon hitting "Run", you get 
    require/typed: bad syntax in: (require/typed (char-compare s67:char-compare) (Char Char -> Integer) srfi/67)

I also tried

    #lang typed-scheme

    (require/typed srfi/67 [(rename char-compare s67:char-compare) (Char Char -> Integer)])

by (mistaken) symmetry with the base language's `require' form.  Upon executing, I get the following error:

    raise-syntax-error: expects type <symbol or #f> as 1st argument, given: "rename not currently supported"; other arguments were: #<syntax>

Using `rename-in' instead of `rename' gives essentially the same syntax error as in the first case above.
