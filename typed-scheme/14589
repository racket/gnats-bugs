>Description:
Some uses of for*/fold create the following syntax error:
?: literal data is not allowed;
 no #%datum syntax transformer is bound
  in: #t

It seems related to sequences that return multiple values.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang typed/racket
(define h (make-immutable-hash (list (cons 0 #t))))
(for*/fold ([f : Boolean #f])
    ([(k b) (in-hash-values h)])
  (or f b))
