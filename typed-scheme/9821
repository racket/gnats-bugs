>Description:
In a "real" statically-typed language this wouldn't be an issue, but in
typed-scheme there are bindings that exist, but have no type.  It would
be nice if the error message would indicate that.  For example, when I
enter `acos' I'd like to see an error telling me that it is bound but
untyped, instead of just throwing the same error as for stuff that is
really untyped.  (And yes, this matters only for those of us who create
dialects based on typed-scheme.)

 You already get different messages.
 
 If you do this:
 
 #lang typed-scheme
 squark
 
 you get a different message than:
 
 #lang typed-scheme
 acos
 
 Is that not what you want?

 I get almost the same message (not with acos, which does have a type
 now):
 
   . expand: unbound identifier in module in: squark
 
 and
 
   . typecheck: unbound identifier regexp-replace in: regexp-replace
 
 and I think that the latter should make it clearer that the binding
 exists but has no type declared (especially at this stage where the
 language is still growing).
 
 (But I now see that with my language the error is the exactly same,
 but that might be unrelated.  Possibly something with the fact that I
 get no source information.)
