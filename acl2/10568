 Note that setting these prefs is a little bit tricky because the
 initial window size may not be what you expect it to be so the
 percentage setting may signal a runtime error. So just catch the
 runtime errors and toss them. (Perhaps there should be a better
 interface for setting the percentages, I know.)
