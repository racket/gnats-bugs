I am running Windows Vista Home Premium service pack 1 and I am having trouble getting certificates for "io-utilities :dir :teachpacks" and "list-utilities :dir :teachpacks" I'm not sure if it is an OS incompatability.

(as previously reported by email)

 To certify the teachpacks, open the io-utilities.lisp and
 list-utilities.lisp files in Dracula, found in the directory:
 
 C:\Documents and Settings\<your username>\Application Data\PLT
 Scheme\planet\300\<PLT Scheme
 version>\cache\cce\dracula.plt\4\2\teachpacks
 
 ...where you choose the appropriate subdirectories for <your username>
 and <PLT Scheme version>.  Note that Application Data is a hidden
 subdirectory.  Use the Save/Certify button to certify list-utilities
 first, then io-utilities.

 Susan,
 
 Thanks for the report.  The io-utilities and list-utilities books are
 sound, and should work on any platform, but certificate files are not
 portable so I can't include them with Dracula.  If you are concerned
 about the certificate warning issued by ACL2, you can safely ignore
 it.  If you need to certify your own files that include these
 teachpacks, you'll have to certify the teachpacks yourself.
 
 The steps to certify the teachpacks are below.  They're complicated
 and involve rooting around in long paths with hidden directories; I
 apologize in advance.  I should really automate this process, and plan
 to do so with the next major release of Dracula.
 
 To certify the teachpacks, open the io-utilities.lisp and
 list-utilities.lisp files in Dracula, found in the directory:
 
 C:\Documents and Settings\<your username>\Application Data\PLT
 Scheme\planet\300\<PLT Scheme
 version>\cache\cce\dracula.plt\4\2\teachpacks
 
 ...where you choose the appropriate subdirectories for <your username>
 and <PLT Scheme version>.  Note that Application Data is a hidden
 subdirectory.  Use the Save/Certify button to certify list-utilities
 first, then io-utilities.
 
 Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.  Please let me know if you
 have any trouble finding this directory or certifying the files.
 
 While investigating your report, I also discovered minor errors in the
 world and doublecheck teachpacks that prevent certification (though
 the documented functions are still sound).  I'll fix these typos and
 re-release ASAP.  The io-utilities and lisp-utilities teachpacks are
 not affected by this.

 I have just released Dracula 6.0, in which these bugs are fixed.  All
 teachpacks can now be certified.  ACL2's usual restrictions apply
 (before you certify a book, certify its dependencies -- this includes
 other teachpacks as well as ACL2 system books).
