 Rex, this is not a bug.  The random testing defproperty performs at
 runtime neither guarantees the logical truth of a claim, nor aids
 ACL2's proof search.  There are many defproperty terms that run
 successfully but nevertheless will not admit.  To find the problem,
 you'll have to either find a counterexample by refining the random
 distributions or prove the theorem correct by applying normal ACL2
 techniques.

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by cce at Wed, 29 Oct 2008 20:24:53 -0400
Reason>>> DoubleCheck's random testing does not guarantee successful
theorem proving.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Wed, 29 Oct 2008 20:24:53 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by cce at Wed, 29 Oct 2008 20:24:53 -0400
Reason>>> Not a bug.
