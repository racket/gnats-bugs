>Description:
Dracula 8.2 writes an empty file that should have been a file with three lines. The write is issued from the string-list->file function in the io-utilities teachpack.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Load the following program with Dracula 8.2:
(in-package "ACL2")
(include-book "io-utilities" :dir :teachpacks)
(set-state-ok t)
(defun main ()
  (string-list->file "xxx.txt" (list "a" "b" "c") state))

2. Issue the (main) command
3. Observe that the file xxx.txt exists but is empty.
4. Delete the xxx.txt file
5. Load the program with Dracula 8.1 and issue the (main) command
6. Observe that the file xxx.txt has three lines

 Rex,
 
 I could not find any change in Dracula 8.2 that was relevant to this
 bug.  Were you able to reproduce this bug multiple times?  Was it run
 on the same machine?  Are you certain 8.1 and 8.2 were the relevant
 version numbers?
 
 There are some oddities with the way DrScheme flushes output to file
 ports.  It may simply be the case that right now, whether or not
 output gets flushed on every command is unpredictable or
 machine-dependent, and has always been so.  The difference you saw
 between 8.1 and 8.2 may be incidental.
 
 I'll continue to look into it and try to identify i/o commands that
 need to flush their output.
 
 --Carl
