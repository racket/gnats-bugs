>Description:
When using DrACuLa, Create Executable the zip archive fails to include the DrACuLa files from C:\documents and settings\user\Application Data\PLT

It also fails to include necessary files for the world teachpack.

The only way for the executable to work is if DrScheme and DrACuLa are installed on the target machine.  This results in a non-distrubutable executable.
>How-To-Repeat:
DrScheme version 360
DrACuLa version beta 11

Go to Dracula menu
Select Create Executable
Select Distrubutable
Create the executable

Copy the exe to a machine without PLT nor DrACuLa (no c:\documents and settings\user\Application Data\PLT folder).

Run the exe and note the error window that comes up stating that resolver could not find a file.

Reason>>> Dracula does not currently support creating executables.  I
have added an appropriate error dialog box which will be
included in the next release.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
