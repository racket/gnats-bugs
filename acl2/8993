Seems to want only 1 argument for string-list->file funciton in io-utilities, but the defun specifies 3 arguments.
>How-To-Repeat:
Step 1:run program with include book teachpacks io-utilities:
(include-book "io-utilities" :dir :teachpacks)

Step 2:issue the following command:
(string-list->file "testwrite.txt" '("34,45" "70,31" "67,89" "34,45") state)

step 3:note that ir reports the following error:
 ../../../Library/PLT Scheme/planet/300/371/cache/cce/dracula.plt/1/1/language/acl2-app.scm::409: procedure string-list->file: expects 1 argument, given 3: "testwrite.txt" ("34,45" "70,31" "67,89" "34,45") |STATE|
