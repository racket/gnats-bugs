>Description:
Dracula would be a much more useful tool if its error messages always included the function which was being executed while the error occurred and the line number, if the error occurred while executing the user's code.  For example, being told that a rational was expected is unhelpful if I am not told what expected the rational.

Class changed from "change-request" to "sw-bug" by cce at Tue, 07 Apr 2009 18:19:23 -0400
Reason>>> This information was provided at one point, and stopped
working.  I will have to investigate when this happened and why.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 07 Apr 2009 18:19:23 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula-related.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:33:38 -0400
Reason>>> With the release of Dracula 8.9, I have fixed the error
checks to include the function name for built-in functions.
