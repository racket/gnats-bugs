>Description:
I noticed that in this build, the stepper button was not getting 
shown & hidden.  It appears to me that the problem is that the 
"after-set-next-settings" method of the definition window is not 
getting called on a language level change.

To reduce the size of the problem, I've written a short piece of 
code that duplicates the problem.  Of course, since it's a tool, 
you have to create a directory for it (test-tool) and run setup-plt.

Anyway, here's the info.ss file:

(module info (lib "infotab.ss" "setup")
  (define name "Test Tool")

  (define tools '(("test-tool.ss")))

  (define tool-names (list "The Test"))

  (define tool-icons (list '("foot-up.png" "icons")))

  )

... and here's the test-tool.ss file:

(module test-tool mzscheme
  (require (lib "unitsig.ss")
           (lib "tool.ss" "drscheme")
           (lib "class.ss"))
           
  
    (provide tool@)

  (define tool@
    (unit/sig drscheme:tool-exports^
      (import drscheme:tool^)

      ;; tool magic here:
      (define (phase1) (void))
      
      (define (phase2) (void))

      ;; stepper-definitions-text-mixin : a mixin for the definitions text that
      ;; alerts the stepper when the definitions text is altered or destroyed
      (define (stepper-definitions-text-mixin %)
        (class %

          (inherit get-top-level-window)
          #;(define/private (notify-stepper-frame-of-change)
            (let ([win (get-top-level-window)])
              ;; should only be #f when win is #f
              (when (is-a? win stepper-unit-frame<%>)
                (let ([stepper-window (send win get-stepper-frame)])
                  (when stepper-window
                    (send stepper-window original-program-changed))))))

          (define/augment (on-insert x y)
            (with-output-to-file "/dev/stderr"
              (lambda () (printf "on-insert got called.\n"))
              'truncate)
            (inner (void) on-insert x y))

          (define/augment (after-set-next-settings s)
            (with-output-to-file "/dev/stderr"
              (lambda () (printf "after-set-next-settings got called\n"))
              'truncate))

          (super-new)))
  
  (drscheme:get/extend:extend-definitions-text
       stepper-definitions-text-mixin))
    
    ))

Note that I overrode the "on-insert" method just so you could 
see whether the tool was properly installed.  I'm sure I could 
have picked a less noisy hook for this, but it serves the purpose.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the tool.  Start drscheme3m.  See the foot icon appear 
twice during startup.  start typing characters in the defn's 
window.  See lots of error messages on stderr ... (ooh, run 
this on a machine like OS X where writing to "/dev/stderr" works
properly).  

Now, change languge levels.  No message written! Click Execute.

 I've just discovered that this bug is a consequence of the ACL2 tool,  
 and the way it messes with compilation.  That is, removing the ACL2  
 tool and recompiling solves this problem.
 
 FWIW, this behavior may not occur with current versions of the ACL2  
 tool; I don't know whether Dale has updated it recently.
 
 Dale, if you've fixed this bug (e.g., by changing the acl2 tool to  
 not bang the compilation environment) feel free to close this bug.
 
 Thanks!

 I fixed this a while back.  But just to be sure:  are you using the  
 current version of the ACL2 tool, or the old one that I provided to  
 you several moons ago when we started discussing the ACL2 stepper?  -

 many moons ago.
 
 okay, I closed it myself, thanks.
