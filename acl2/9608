>Description:
ACL2 !>(INCLUDE-BOOK "doublecheck"
                     :DIR :TEACHPACKS)

ACL2 Warning [Uncertified] in ( INCLUDE-BOOK "doublecheck" ...):  There
is no certificate on file for 
"/Users/cce/plt/research/dracula/trunk/src/teachpacks/doublecheck.lisp".

***********************************************
************ ABORTING from raw Lisp ***********
Error:  Unexpected end of file on #<FILE-CHARACTER-INPUT-STREAM ("/Users/cce/plt/research/dracula/trunk/src/teachpacks/doublecheck.lisp"/4) #x106C0F52C>
***********************************************

If you didn't cause an explicit interrupt (Control-C),
then the root cause may be call of a :program mode
function that has the wrong guard specified, or even no
guard specified (i.e., an implicit guard of t).
See :DOC guards.

To enable breaks into the debugger:
(SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE T)
ACL2 !>(INTERN "|||this-symbol-indicates-that-ACL2-is-done|||"
               "ACL2")
>How-To-Repeat:
The above arose from a syntax error in the doublecheck teachpack: an unclosed paren in the .lisp file.  Dracula signalled it as a success rather than a failure (and attempted to continue with the file).
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 15 Jul 2008 10:00:02 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 15 Jul 2008 10:00:02 -0400
Reason>>> almost certainly a regexp error, as the ACL2 response to raw
lisp errors changed since ACL2 3.1


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:35:55 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula now recognizes raw Lisp errors from ACL2.
