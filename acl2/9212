>Description:
Tried to use structures in DrAcuLa v2.4 but cannot update or set data.  Get error message:

:fmtchunk-size: undefined in: :fmtchunk-size
>How-To-Repeat:
(include-book "world" :dir :teachpacks)

(defstructure fmtchunk
  (fmtchunk-size (:assert (natp fmtchunk-size))))

(defun form-fmt (byte-list)
  (update-fmtchunk nil
                  :fmtchunk-size byte-list))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Wed, 20 Feb 2008 13:22:08 -0500
Reason>>> Thanks for the Dracula bug report.  I'll look into it.


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Wed, 20 Feb 2008 17:31:10 -0500
Reason>>> Found the problem.  Will restore ACL2's behavior where
keyword symbols of the form :NAME are self-quoting, which
was lost in Dracula 2.x.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Thu, 21 Feb 2008 16:22:34 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed and released.
