>Description:
When a proof goes on for a long time, it is sometimes helpful to interrupt it to see what it's been doing. The Stop button discards all the proof summary information, so there is no viable interrupt option.

Might be best to have a standard time limit of 30 seconds or so. When it runs out, a box pops up stating the time limit and offering a means to change it for the next proof, and the proof summary remains available.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 26 Oct 2010 15:08:00 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 26 Oct 2010 15:08:00 -0400
Reason>>> Setting a default time limit is an excellent idea, similar
to DrRacket's default memory size limit.
