>Description:
While using ACL2 in Dracula, if you try to interrupt the proof, ACL2 throws out an error stating:
"The symbol X (in package "ACL2") has neither a function nor macro definition in ACL2.  Please define it." where X is the function it was working on last. It should recognize that the user asked to interrupt the proof
>How-To-Repeat:
With your code, click the Start ACL2 button.  Click Admit All.  Before ACL2 Finishes, click the Interrupt Proof Button to Stop ACL2.  You can read the error in ACL2's Log.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 06 May 2008 12:50:41 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula bug

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 06 May 2008 12:50:41 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula does not recognize the output of an aborted proof as
an error, and attempts to admit the next definition.  It
needs to recognize the output correctly, not to mention
remember that the user hit Interrupt and abort regardless of
output.
