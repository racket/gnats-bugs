>Description:
Using open-input-channel or open-output-channel no matter what io-type I use it says that it's undefined.  I know that these IO types are standard in acl2 and I know that this code worked a month ago.  I don't know why it is not working now.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 20 Nov 2007 12:10:34 -0500
Reason>>> Dracula bug.


State changed from "open" to "closed" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 15:31:06 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in Dracula v2.5.  The actual problem appears to have
been self-quoting keywords of the form :word, which were
broken in Dracula 2.4.
