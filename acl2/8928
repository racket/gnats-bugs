>Description:
IO-utilities announces five functions. Three of them work, but loc seems to be entirely missing, and string-list->file expects one argument when it should expect three, the last one being state. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Run a code containing this include-book command:
  (include-book "io-utilities" :dir :teachpacks)
2. Evaluate the following formulas
  (loc "path-to-a-file" state)
  (string-list->file "filename" '("line1" "line2") state)
>Fix:
