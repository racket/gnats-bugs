 Rex, I'm going through the Dracula bug reports I inherited from Dale,
 and I came upon one from you with a broken link:
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 After starting ACL2 and pressing the Admit button, one of my students,
 Charles Work, gets an error report in std output that looks like this:
 skip-whitespace: called on a color:text<%> whose colorer is stopped.
 
 We encountered this in working with a .scm file that I will put at
 http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/CWork.scm
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Do you still have the file CWork.scm?  If you don't, I'll do what I
 can to stress the syntax colorer, but I'd appreciate any help you can
 give in duplicating the bug.  Of course, please let me know if this
 bug turns out to be obsolete.
 
 Thanks for your help.

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Wed, 17 Oct 2007 17:09:00 -0400
Reason>>> Does not reproduce in current release of Dracula.  Bug is
probably obsolete due to subsequent changes in implementation.
