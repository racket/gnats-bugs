ACL2 Error in ( DEFPKG "U" ...):  The proposed defpkg conflicts with
a previously-executed defpkg for name "U".  For example, symbol ACL2::PLEV0
is in the list of imported symbols for the current definition but not
for the other.  The previous defpkg is in the .cert file 
"c:/acl2-3.3/acl2-sources/books/data-structures/structures.cert" for
the book "c:/acl2-3.3/acl2-sources/books/data-structures/structures.lisp",
which is included via the following path, from top-most book down to
the above file.
  (
   "C:/Documents and Settings/lab-rex/Application Data/PLT Scheme/planet/300/372/cache/cce/dracula.plt/2/5/teachpacks/world.lisp"

   "c:/acl2-3.3/acl2-sources/books/data-structures/structures.lisp")
This previous defpkg event appears to have been created because of
a defpkg that was hidden by a local include-book; see :DOC hidden-
death-package.
The new proposed defpkg event may be found by following the sequence
of include-books below, from top-most book down to the book whose portcullis
contains the new proposed defpkg event.
