>Description:
If you ran ACL2, and it reaches an error in one of your theorems that requires a change to a function. You can click undo last to the function you need to change, change it, and re-admit it. If the function you need to change uses a helper function already defined and admitted, then you cannot admit the function with ACL2 claiming that the helper function is not defined. ACL2 states, "The symbol HELPER_FUNCTION (in package "ACL2") has neither a function nor macro definition in ACL2.  Please define it."

You need to undo all helper functions and re-admit them as well for ACL2 to work correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a function that needs a helper function (like insert-sort). Create a theorem that would cause ACL2 to fail.
Undo up to and including the main function but not the helper function. Make a change in the function.
Admit the function. ACL2 should fail, stating that the helper function is not defined.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Sun, 25 May 2008 11:08:54 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula bug

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Sun, 25 May 2008 11:08:54 -0400
Reason>>> This is a check-expect bug: Dracula emits an undo operation
for it, but ACL2 does not treat it as an event, so the undo
rolls back a previous term.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:36:45 -0400
Reason>>> This has actually been fixed for some time; Dracula no
longer "guesses" how much to undo, but asks ACL2 how far it
will need to undo after each term.
