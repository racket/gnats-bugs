Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Thu, 19 Nov 2009 16:38:45 -0500
Reason>>> Dracula-related

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Thu, 19 Nov 2009 16:38:45 -0500
Reason>>> Prover GUI needs to allow different modes (hidden, docked,
undocked).


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:30:09 -0400
Reason>>> With the release of Dracula version 8.9, the Dracula proof
window can now be hidden (and later shown again) using the
"Hide ACL2 Window" and "Show ACL2 Window" options under the
"Dracula" menu.
