 This arises when a character constant is at the end of a line on a
 Windows machine, in a file ACL2 is reading from disk.  Windows
 newlines have a carriage return followed by a linefeed, and ACL2
 expects just a linefeed.  It interprets the carriage return as part of
 the character constant and flags it as an error.  This doesn't arise
 when Dracula is sending the data to ACL2 directly, as Dracula uses
 only a linefeed, so this will only come up with certification or
 include-book.
 
 The proper solution is for Dracula to save files with only linefeed
 characters.  Until we implement that, don't terminate lines with a
 character constant.  Put something else at the end of the line, even
 if just a comment, and the reader should accept it, as carriage
 returns elsewhere aren't problematic.
