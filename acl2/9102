 Derek,
 
 Thanks for the report.  The io-utilities book includes the
 list-utilities book, which in turn includes this book:
 
 (include-book "arithmetic-2/floor-mod/floor-mod" :dir :system)
 
 Notice that it's using a book by the same name as what you tried to
 include, but from the arithmetic-2 directory instead of arithmetic-3.
 Those books contain different functions by the same names, and ACL2
 can't deal with it.  Try using the arithmetic-2 version of the book
 and there won't be any clash.  I hope this helps.

 Can you print an error message when people include incompatible books  
 to say that they are incompatible?

 Unfortunately not right now.  Dracula currently fakes its way through
 books to a large extent.  For the io-utilities book, Dracula provides
 the "major" or "public" functions and skips the "minor" or "internal"
 ones, including all includes from other books.  For the
 floor-mod-book, Dracula ignores it entirely, assuming it provides only
 theorems and not functions.  So Dracula cannot detect the
 incompatibility between the two.  I'd like to improve the situation,
 but that would require adding more of the ACL2 functionality found in
 books, and implementing many more of the ACL2 books in Dracula.  I
 don't see a quick fix.

 Derek,
 
 I'm glad you worked out your problem.  Sorry for the incompatibility.
 We're working on features to eliminate these problems, including
 support for ACL2's encapsulate and local declarations, and a wholly
 new module system.  In the meantime, we have to work around a few
 problems like these.  I hope you enjoy using Dracula, and keep an eye
 out for new and better versions.
 
 Thanks for the feedback!
 
 --Carl
