>Description:
at the site http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cce/acl2/ in the section regarding "Running  Dracula," the site tells users to select "ACL2 beginner" as the language after installing DrACuLa. Unfortunately, the name of the language in DrScheme is now "DrACuLa ACL2," and this is causing a great deal of confusion with some of the beginner users (my students). 
>How-To-Repeat:
go to http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cce/acl2/ and scroll to "Running Dracula" towards the botom of the page, and read the second bullet point.
