>Description:
There is often a long delay after pressing the down arrow to choose a module to start contract verification in Modular ACL2.

The delay is often so long that the user concludes something has gone wrong. One doesn't expect a long delay when pressing a dropdown selection button. Also, many people think they can select a module by clicking in the <Choose A Module> edit box.

Might be better eliminate the edit box and put the interface on the Start button. Press start, eventually a module selection option pops up, preferably with some indicator in the mean time to reassure the user that something is happening. After selection, the Start button lights up again.
>How-To-Repeat:
Press down arrow to start contract checking on moderate sized Modular ACL2 program.
