>Description:
The DoubleCheck tester for Dracula does not support some commonly desired random distributions as random rational numbers, integers in an unspecified or randomly generated range, and so forth.

Also, DoubleCheck requires some arguments and information that could be defaulted - such as default numbers of tests, a default generator of all s-expressions, and a default predicate of T.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 17:18:38 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula (DoubleCheck) bug

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 17:18:38 -0400
Reason>>> Needs more generators, syntax improvements.
