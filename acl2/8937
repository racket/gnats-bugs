>Description:
In spring of this year, importing the image teachpack picked up such functions as "text", "image-width", and "image-height". Now, it appears that the run support for the functions in the image teachpack has disappeared.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Open Dracula program containing (include-book "image" :dir :teachpacks) command
2. Press Admit Next until this include-book turns green
3. Press Run
4. Note bug report from Dracula: include-book: Cannot find specified Teachpack in: "image"

 I tried to use the bug-tracking system to add an update to this
 report, but my system hung and I didn't want to try it again, so I'm
 going around the system with this note.
 
 I see, now, from the documentation, that the world teachpack makes
 functions like "text" from the image teachpack available. I was
 importing both world and image. But, when I removed the include-book
 for image, the program still could not find the "text" function.

 Rex,
 
 Sorry, let me clarify that.  I can add "image" if you need, or you can
 just keep working with "world".  But I don't know if you're just
 looking for a consistent interface (i.e. having the "image" teachpack
 separate from "world"), or if you're actually missing functionality
 (i.e. "world" is not only the wrong name, but also doesn't have
 enough).  Let me know what you need and I'll update it.  Thanks.

 Rex,
 
 That's correct - right now Dracula only properly supports the "world"
 teachpack; "image" is just a support file in the ACL2 implementation.
 Is there any image-processing missing from "world" that you need?

 Only known missing function at the moment:
    image-height : Image -> Int
 
 Earlier, I thought (text ...) and (image-width ...) were also missing, 
 but all the problems boiled down to image-height.
