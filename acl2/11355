>Description:
If you press the choose-a-module down arrow, but the open file is not a module, an empty selection box pops up (eventually). Maybe the choose-a-module down arrow could be disabled when the active file is not a module.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download files from here:
http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/SEtools/Lectures/ModularACL2demo/
Open Rcodec.lisp in Modular ACL2. Press choose-a-module down arrow.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 26 Oct 2010 15:06:31 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by cce at Tue, 26 Oct 2010 15:06:31 -0400
Reason>>> Unfortunately, until compilation happens, there is no good
way to know if the file contains a module or not. 
Eventually I would like to implement background compilation,
but that will take time so as not to overwhelm the CPU.  For
now, hopefully solving PR 11354 will improve this issue.
