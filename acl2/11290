 Rex,
 
 The most obvious explanation for this bug is a permissions error in
 the file "C:\Users\Rex Page\AppData\Roaming\Racket\racket-prefs.rktd".
  Can you verify that you have permission to overwrite this file (or
 create it if it does not exist) on the machine in question?  It looks
 like Racket is trying to save the name of the file you open to the
 list of recent files, and can't write the new preference file.  If the
 preferences are set properly we'll have to investigate other
 possibilities.
