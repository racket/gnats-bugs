>Description:
When constructing a program aon the fly, the ACL2 interface requires backing up before going forward with next admit.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Define a function
2. Press the Admit arrow (defun turns green)
3. Define a new function after first one.
4. Admit button remains disabled.
You can recover by pressing the Undo arrow or Reset arrow.
Then, Admit is reenabled. Could be a feature, I guess.

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Mon, 09 Feb 2009 09:27:38 -0500
Reason>>> This is a Dracula-related bug.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Mon, 09 Feb 2009 09:27:38 -0500
Reason>>> The code to enable Admit buttons doesn't handle cases where
the program is extended.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:35:10 -0400
Reason>>> This was fixed a few minor releases ago; Dracula no longer
greys out theorem prover buttons unnecessarily.
