>Description:
In the GUI output from defproperty, only failing test cases list their generated values.  It is often helpful to see succeeding values as well, to find the important factor between success and failure.

Also, the output from failure cases does not draw attention to generated values well.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 17:49:40 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula (DoubleCheck) bug

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 17:49:40 -0400
Reason>>> Will need to either pass request on to SchemeUnit, or stop
using SchemeUnit for output (and use a custom GUI).
