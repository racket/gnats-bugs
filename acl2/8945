>Description:
The functions text, circle, and image-width run when the world teachpack is imported in Dracula. In some cases (http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/SEtools/mouse-demo.lisp), defuns invoking circle admit. In oher cases, they don't (see steps to reproduce. I have not found any cases where text or image-width admit, and image-height neither runs not admits in the testing I've done.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Enter this code:
(include-book "world" :dir :teachpacks)
(defconst *chr* (text "M" 12 'red))
(defconst *img* (circle 15 'solid 'red))
(defconst *w* (image-width *img*)) 
;(defconst *h* (image-height *img*))

2. Press Run button and observe that the constants have appropriate values.

3. Press Start ACL, then Admit All.

4. Note that text function doesn't admit.

5. Comment out first defconst and press Admit again. Note that circle doesn't admit.

6. Ditto for image-width

 Rex, this is working as intended.  ACL2 cannot execute image functions
 and is not supposed to.  They are stubs: you can reason about them,
 but not run them.  If you need image constants in your program, I
 suggest you implement them as functions of no arguments, so
 
 (defconst *img* (circle 15 'solid 'red))
 
 becomes
 
 (defun img () (circle 15 'solid 'red))
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

 We have to do something about this.
 
 Pls open the bug report again.

 I have reopened the bug.  Images will remain unimplemented: we cannot
 provide a faithful implementation in ACL2, and an unfaithful
 implementation will allow invalid theorems.  However, I will work on
 better error messages and documentation to avoid confusion in the
 future.

 I have a new plan to implement some of the image functionality in
 ACL2.  I can implement an algebraic (i.e. list- or tree-based) image
 representation in both Dracula and ACL2, using some distinguished
 symbols to set them apart (e.g. image::circle, image::rectangle,
 etc.).  Then Dracula can default to rendering those values as images,
 but both languages will have the same representation.
 
 Some function, such as image->color-list, cannot be implemented
 platform-independently.  They will have to remain unimplemented in
 ACL2.  Unless they're necessary, I may leave them out entirely.
 
 It'll be at least a few weeks before I put some serious time into this
 one, but it's still on my radar.
