(random-int-between 1 0) returns either 0 or 1.  It should actually throw an error, since the range is empty.
>How-To-Repeat:
(defproperty foobar 1000
  ((n (random-int-between 1 0) (natp n)))
  (equal n 0))

>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 14:15:56 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula (doublecheck) bug.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 14:15:56 -0400
Reason>>> The contract on random-int-between needs to be stricter.


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 16:43:42 -0400
