>Description:
I'd like to be able to rename something like how-many to count, including the theorem. Dale had worked out how to do this and I am pretty sure demonstrated a version of this to me. 

In any case, I think it would be good to have. 

;; structural recursion 
;; intended contract: [Listof X] -> Number 
;; how many items are on the list 
(defun how-many(l)
  (cond
    ((endp l) 0)
    (t (+ 1 (how-many (cdr l))))))

;; the length of any list is a positive number 
(defthm g-is-natural (natp (how-many l)))
(defthm g-greater-than-0 (>= (how-many l) 0))

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Sun, 04 Nov 2007 18:03:10 -0500
Reason>>> Dracula bug


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 14:28:08 -0400
Reason>>> Will need to restore checker annotations to defthm & similar
proof-only terms.
