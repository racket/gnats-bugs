Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 21:41:14 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula bug

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 21:41:14 -0400
Reason>>> More specifically, Dracula's Admit/Undo are interfering in
some way (perhaps via highlighting) with the standard
DrScheme Edit->Undo feature.  The undo stack seems to vanish.
