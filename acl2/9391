>Description:
If ACL2 output is not stopped by stopping ACL2 from printing out, Dracula will sometimes crash. If trying to certify a book, you can't stop ACL2 from printing the proofs so you can't certify those files from Dracula. It would be helpful to be able to shut off printing out or limit printing out through Dracula.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/SEcollab/AVL/
The balance.lisp theorems will crash Dracula after a very long time (20+ minutes) instead of finishing the proof. In a command prompt, it will take about 6 minutes to prove. The first hangup is on rot-R-restores-bal.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "cce" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 14:26:28 -0400
Reason>>> Dracula bug


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Wed, 14 May 2008 15:57:08 -0400
Reason>>> I'll try to duplicate this bug in my own Dracula and see if
I can find the source of the problem.


State changed from "analyzed" to "feedback" by cce at Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:38:54 -0400
Reason>>> The linked file is no longer available, so I can't test this
bug.  However, I think it was fixed in Dracula version 8.2,
when I removed a memory leak that caused Dracula to run out
of memory during verbose proofs.
