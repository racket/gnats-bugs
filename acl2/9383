>Description:
Sometimes when I press the Start ACL2 button, Dracula asks for the loc of the exe file, but if I cancel the dialog, and press the Start ACL2 button again, it finds the exe without asking.
>How-To-Repeat:
Doesn't always happen, but it occurs repeatedly on the same machine, even after several DrScheme start-ups. I'm not sure whether or not it happens twice in the same session.
