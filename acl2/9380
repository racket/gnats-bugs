>Description:
Hi!

I thought the trick of check the assumptions of an
implications was a fantastic suggestion.  While I
was testing a property that I had actually verified,
though, I made a mistake in generatnig the right type
of value to satisfy my predicate.  Starting at the
expression for a long time didn't help.  Maybe if the
system printed some of the values that didn't satisfy
one of the predicates could help with this kind of
problem...?

Reason>>> Dracula (DoubleCheck) bug

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by cce at Tue, 13 May 2008 17:50:53 -0400
Reason>>> Error message for value generation errors should report (a)
the generator expression, (b) the predicate expression, and
(c) the values that failed the test.

 Hi Walid: I'm missing some context here -- probably this bug report
 isn't aimed at me, but rather than letting slip thru the cracks,
 perhaps you could let me know what tool specifically you're talking
 about?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

Reason>>> The failed values from a DoubleCheck generator have now been
printed out for some time; I have just improved the error
messages for most trials to direct the user to the trial
where the full list is shown.  Until a major overhaul of
DoubleCheck, this is the best I am likely to be able to do.
