>Description:
I have a bunch of macros that expand into 
top-level definitions.  One of the definitions 
is for `e1'.

A syntax-rules macro has a clause of the form

      [(_ (e1 e2 ...)) ...]

When I run the code, DrScheme complains

 define-values: identifier for a module-body definition already has a lexical context in: e1

If I rename those e's to something else, everything
works again.

Same thing happens in MzScheme.

I could be mistaken, but this seems like a 
hygiene violation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unpack files in http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~steck/tmp/hygiene.tar.gz

(require "axioms.ss")

I tried to come up with a smaller example, but 
wasn't able to do so quickly.

 The place where changing the binding names changes 
 the result is marked in that file, about line 180.

 Note that the top-level definition uses a constructed 
 identifier, not one that's lexically apparent in the 
 macro.  So maybe this is an unavoidable problem.
