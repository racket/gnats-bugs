>Description:
In the document "Library Collections and MzLib"
the following code appears:

  (current-library-collection-paths
   (path-list-string->path-list
    (or (getenv "PLTCOLLECTS") "")
    (or (ormap (lambda (p) (and p (directory-exists? p) (list p)))
               (list (let ([v (getenv "PLTHOME")]) (and v (build-path v "collects")))
                     (find-executable-path program "collects")
               \>"/usr/local/lib/plt/collects" ; Unix only
               \>"/boot/apps/plt/collects" ; BeOS only
               \>"c:\\plt\\collects")) ; Windows only
        null)))

Remarkably enough, this is syntactically legal
Scheme code and will often work because one
of the first few tests succeeds in the ormap
(and there's no pesky type system in the way).

Submitted as a software bug because it looks
like a \> tabbing directive isn't being
recognized.
>How-To-Repeat:
Search in Help Desk for "paths".  The second
entry ought to be to the above document.
