>Description:
( 1 . + . 2 3 ) works
( 1 2 . + . 3 ) works

but

( . + . 1 2 3 ) doesn't work and
( 1 2 3 . + . ) doesn't work either

Is there any special reason for that?

(yes, I've come across some code where the last form,
with the function at the end, would make the code more
readable - no, I'm not desperate for it, I'm just
wondering why it doesn't work in all cases)

 The only reason is that I was being conservative, allowing only what
 seemed useful (to avoid confusion when someone makes a mistake).
 
 I can see how the latter form could be useful. Should I enable it?

 It's up to you.  I don't care that much, I just think it would make
 things more symmetrical and predictable.
