>Description:
Just for clarity -- it's August 10 2006, I'm in Seattle WA, and it's indeed daylight savings time.  /etc/timezone says "US/Pacific", which sounds right to me.  The "date" command says "Thu Aug 10 12:52:08 PDT 2006", which also sounds right.  And in Guile scheme, this form

        (localtime (current-time))

yields

        #(2 47 12 10 7 106 4 221 1 25200 "PDT")

which looks right.  In particular, the second-to-last value is the number of seconds to add to get UTC; that works out to seven hours, which seems right.  And further: on Windows (mzscheme 352),

        (date-time-zone-offset (seconds->date (current-seconds)))

yields

        -25200

which also seems right.

But on my linux machine, the same form yields

        -28800

which seems to be one hour too small.

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

Under Linux, MzScheme was using timezone without
adding an hour for daylight saving. On any other platform
where timezone is used, it's offset for dst. I'm not sure why 
the Linux configuration was different; probably I just got it
wrong long ago.
