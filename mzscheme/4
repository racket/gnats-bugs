>Description:
refer.ss contains a definition for begin-elaboration-time (using
define-macro).  This overrides M3's own definition.  Hence, M3 gets
all tangled up when it someone require-library's refer.ss.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "trigger.ss") set it off for Kathi.  You'll get a
"define not at top-level" error.
>Fix:
I feel begin-elaboration-time should be moved into the core of
MzScheme.  I don't know Matthew's take on this.

(Does this work?  My first send-pr, hurrah (or something like that).)

 Hey, plt-gnats, who are you?  Do you respond?  What happens if I'm Sam
 Carter writing to tell you you're a fucking retard for acknowledging
 my bug report?

 I'm opposed to moving everything that's different between M3 and
 MzScheme+MzLib into built-in MzScheme.
 
 Instead, perhaps we want a `library-provided' procedure, since this is
 a more accurate reflection of what is happening. For a namespace used
 by m3, (library-provided "refer.ss" (void)) would be called.

 That wasn't what I was suggesting.  begin-elaboration-time appeared to
 be a special case.

 That would be fine by me.
 
 I won't be in today (we're planning to hop over to San Jacinto), so
 I'll see you tomorrow and work this out.
