>Description:
Here is the documentation of for/vector :

--

(for/vector (for-clause ...) body ...+)
(for/vector #:length length-expr (for-clause ...) body ...+)

Iterates like for/list, but the result are accumulated into a vector
instead of a list. If the optional #:length form is used, then
length-expr must evaluate to an exact-nonnegative-integer?, and the
result vector is constructed with this length. In this case, the
iteration can be performed more efficiently, and terminates when the
vector is full or the requested number of iterations have been
performed, whichever comes first.

--

I interpret this paragraph to mean, that

     (for/vector #:length 10 ([i (in-naturals)]) i)

ought to terminate - but it doesn't !
