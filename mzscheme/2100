>Description:
In previous versions of DrScheme,when one clicked
on "Help->Help Desk" and entered "slib" in 
the "Find docs for:" box at the bottom of the
window, info would be returned that said where
"slib" should be installed (I believe it is 
supposed to be placed wherever "mzlib" is located
which is in /usr/local/plt/collects). It also
described how to reference the library, i.e.
 
(require-library "init.ss" "slibinit")

I'm not positive on this info. It would be
helpful if a reference to slib were put back
somewhere in the documentation.
>How-To-Repeat:
As described above. Begin by clicking on
"Help->Help Desk" and then enter "slib" in
search box at bottom of window.

 Hi,
 
 The real problem is that we haven't yet looked at setting up SLIB for
 199.X. I'll do that sometime in the new few days.

 I've exp-tagged new 199.X files for the "slibinit" collection. Seems to
 work ok with SLIB 2d2 (though I'm not sure how to test it).
