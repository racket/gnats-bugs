>Description:
the code below gives this error:

#<struct:object:derived-from-definitions-text%>:13:7: compile: identifier used out of context in: x

but I think that there shouldn't be any error. The first invoke expression is
okay, so why shouldn't the second one also be okay?
>How-To-Repeat:
(module m mzscheme

  (require (lib "unitsig.ss"))

  (define u 'whatever)

  (let ([x 1])
    (invoke-unit/sig u (x)))

  (unit/sig ()
    (import ())
    (let ([x 1])
      (invoke-unit/sig u (x)))))

 The bug is a problem with partial expansion for `let', `letrec', and
 `let*' forms.
 
 It will be fixed in 199.23.
