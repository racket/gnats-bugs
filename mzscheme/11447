>Description:
Section 1.2.1 currently reads:

"There is no difference between an unbound identifier and one with a top-level binding; within a module, references to top-level bindings are disallowed, and so such identifiers are called unbound in a module context."

May I suggest the following to increase clarity:

In a module context, there is no difference between an unbound identifier and one with a top-level binding; i.e., within
a module, references to top-level bindings are disallowed.
