Human Language: english
>Description:
In the following text, there are several instances of
the superscript "1":

expr is one of
  variable
  (lambda formals expr ···1)
  (case-lambda (formals expr ···1) ···1)
  (if expr expr)
  (if expr expr expr)
  (begin expr ···1)
  (begin0 expr expr ···)
  (let-values (((variable ···) expr) ···) expr ···1)
  (letrec-values (((variable ···) expr) ···) expr ···1)
  (set! variable expr)
  (quote datum)
  (quote-syntax datum)
  (with-continuation-mark expr expr expr)
  (#%app expr ···)
  (#%datum . datum)
  (#%top . variable)


It appears that this is a reference to a footnote to an
earlier chapter to the effect that later clauses of a 
case-lambda may never be executed if earlier ones subsume
it.  But in this case, I don't see how it should be 
attached to anything other than the case-lambda clause.

I'll fix this myself if I get confirmation that this 
should be changed.

 No, it's not a footnote. See the notation guide:
 
  http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/202/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-1.html#%_sec_1.2
 
 However, one of those "1" shouldn't be there. A `case-lambda' expression
 can have 0 clauses.
