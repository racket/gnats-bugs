>Description:
The contract given in the documentation for make-do-sequence is:

(->* ()
     ((any/c . -> . any/c)
      (any/c . -> . any)
      any/c
      (() list? . ->* . any/c)
      (() list? . ->* . any/c)
      ((any/c) any/c . ->* . any/c)))

But this is ill-formed.  It is missing the values keyword, and should
probably be -> instead of ->*, ie:

(-> (values
     (any/c . -> . any/c)
     (any/c . -> . any)
     any/c
     (() list? . ->* . any/c)
     (() list? . ->* . any/c)
     ((any/c) any/c . ->* . any/c)))

This is still ill-formed because of the inner ->*s.  I'm 
not sure what these should be -- the documentation doesn't
mention the optional arguments AFAICT. 

Maybe (() (list?) . ->* . any/c), etc.?
