>Description:
Ports returned by 'make-limited-input-port' do not provide progress events. It would be useful if they did, if that's possible.

Is it generally safe to implement the get-progress-evt procedure for a "wrapping" port (like limited input ports) by just calling 'port-progress-evt' on the underlying port? (When, of course, the underlying port provides progress events.)
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require scheme/port)
(define in (open-input-string "hello"))
(define lin (make-limited-input-port in 2))
(port-provides-progress-evts? lin)

 Yes, it's afes when the `read' and `peek' operations are also
 implemented by passing through to the underlying port. Since that's the
 case for `make-limited-input-port', feel free to change the
 implementation.
