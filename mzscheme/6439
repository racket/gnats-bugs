>Description:
There are C++ (//) comments in the c code. While gcc doesn't mind,
the HP compiler gacks on the following:

plt/src/wxxt/src/Utilities/Net.c
 line 44
  // Get hostname
plt/src/mzscheme/src/bool.c
 line 284
  // used by external programs that cannot link to variables.
plt/src/mzscheme/gc/include/private/gcconfig.h
 line 228-9
  // PLTSCHEME: added MPW_C, and !MACH test to prevent this clause from being
  // evaluated when compiling using Metrowerks with OS X
plt/src/mzscheme/src/symbol.c
 line 100, 103
  // h += (h << 5) + h + c;
  ...
  // post hash mixing helps for short symbols
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with a intolerant vendor compiler :)
>Fix:
