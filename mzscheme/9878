>Description:
I'm trying to compile DrScheme from sources on Arch Linux with a freshly-compiled version of gcc (4.3.2).  The compile fails almost immediately as soon as it tries to compile anything in the src/foreign/ subdirectory, complaining of missing stddef.h and stdarg.h header files:

cd ../foreign; make all
make foreign.lo
/src/plt/plt-4.1.1/src/lt/libtool --mode=compile --tag=CC gcc -g -O2  -Wall     -DMZ_USES_SHARED_LIB -I./../mzscheme -I.
/../mzscheme/include -I./../mzscheme/src -Igcc/libffi/include -c ./foreign.c -o foreign.lo
 gcc -g -O2 -Wall -DMZ_USES_SHARED_LIB -I./../mzscheme -I./../mzscheme/include -I./../mzscheme/src -Igcc/libffi/include 
-c ./foreign.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/foreign.o
In file included from ./../mzscheme/include/scheme.h:127,
                 from ./../mzscheme/src/schpriv.h:21,
                 from ./foreign.c:12:
/usr/include/stdio.h:34:21: error: stddef.h: No such file or directory
In file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:75,
                 from ./../mzscheme/include/scheme.h:127,

                 from ./foreign.c:12:

                 from ./../mzscheme/src/schpriv.h:21,
                 from ./foreign.c:12:
/usr/include/libio.h:332: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'size_t'
/usr/include/libio.h:364: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'size_t'

/usr/include/libio.h:493: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before '_IO_sgetn'

and so on.

By chance, I happened to find out that if I cd'd to the src/foreign/ subdirectory and tried to compile a simple hello-world program it also failed with very similar error messages.  When I renamed the src/foreign/gcc/ subdirectory to something else, I could compile programs.  So apparently the gcc subdirectory is confusing my gcc.  I gather that this subdirectory contains a lot of gcc-specific files which I assume I shouldn't need.  I don't know how to fix this.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Compile gcc 4.3.2 from scratch on your system and make sure the new version is the one in your path.

2) Configure plt-scheme-4.1.1 and try to make it.

3) See above.

 After further investigation, this bug turns out to be a problem either 
 with gcc or with Arch Linux, but not with DrScheme, so it can be withdrawn.

 OK, I closed it.
