 How about FFI calls? Presumably calls to 'ffi-lib' pass through the
 filesystem check (or should, anyway), but what about accessing existing
 foreign bindings?
 
 Performing the check when 'get-ffi-obj' is called is too early, but
 performing the check at every access to the resulting procedure (for
 foreign functions) seems like it might be a big performance hit for the
 FFI.

 Well, if you start it with no existing bindings, then you won't be
 able to access a library that provides you with bindings -- since at
 that point it would require `execute' permissions for the library.
 (And the sandbox does not allow any executes by default.)
 
 (But good point -- I need to check that there is no caching at the C
 level that avoids the security guard.)

 Right -- the above calls should not be a performance problem, except
 maybe for getting the current directory.
