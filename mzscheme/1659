>Description:
require-library cannot always work in libraries
>How-To-Repeat:
Let's say we have three files

test/file1.scm:
....

test/file2.scm:
(require-relative-library "file1")

mainfile.scm:
(require-library "test/file2.scm")

it will find file2, but not file 1.

require-library/require-relative-library are not made for the first 
argument to be a relative path, but it accepts it.

The user of the library test is making a fault, but the fault looks 
like it comes from inside the library... It's a confusing behaviour.
