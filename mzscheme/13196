>Description:
(This is the error that I've seen at rcon, submitted as a test case
for the upcoming expander rewrite.)

Run the code below, and you'll get a "link: namespace mismatch" error.
Comment in the first `require' line and comment out the second one, it
should do the same but now it works.  Alternatively, if you remove the
`b' module definition there is no error.  Yet another alternative is
to drop the `read-json' reference and it works too.  And one more
alternative: instead of `json' use `racket/list' and something like
`append*' instead of `read-json' and there is no error with that one
too.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/load
(module a racket
  (provide foo)
  ;; (require (for-syntax json))
  (begin-for-syntax (require json))
  (define-syntax foo
    (lambda (stx)
      (syntax-case stx ()
        [_ (begin read-json #'1)]))))
(module b racket
  (require 'a)
  (foo))
