>Description:
I rapidly move code from one file to another, and often forget to
omit the "require" clauses.  

For example, I'll (require (lib "url.ss" "net")), and use "make-url";
then later I'll move the code that uses make-url into a new file
... but I'll forget to omit the "require".
                             
So, if I require a module, but then don't actually use anything from
it, mzscheme could inform me of that fact.  Similarly, if I (require
(only "..." foo bar baz)), and use "foo" but not "bar" and "baz", it
could tell me that, too.

That way my "require" clauses won't grow without bound :-)

 Mzscheme can't really signal an error in that case, since requiring
 the module might have some important side-effect.
 
 But, you can run check syntax and look for red.

Reason>>> DrScheme is considered an insufficient solution to the problem.
