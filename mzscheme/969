I wrote in about a month ago about some build problems
under the Cygnus20.1.  I fixed some of the build problems
and got everything to compile, but mzscheme just hangs
after starting it.

I was wondering if anyone else had reported similar
problems and if there was a patch available to address
the problem?

 Sorry for not responding to your original message. At the time, I
 thought that a 100alpha2 release was imminent, and I could more easily
 address you problems in that release. Unfortunately, 100alpha2 is still
 not out.
 
 For now, I've built an archive containing the source code for version
 100/35 (which means "the 35th internal release before the public 100
 release"). The archive is at:
 
  ftp.cs.rice.edu/public/mflatt/alphavers/mzsrcwin.100.zip
 
 This version compiles and runs correctly for me using Cygwin B20. I
 belive it will fix the problems you saw in 53, because I worked on
 MzScheme's I/O a lot between 53 and 100.
 
 
 Your original report noted that plt/bin doesn't exist in the Windows
 distribution. That is intentional. Under Windows, the executables
 should go directly in the `plt' directory. (I've fixed `mzmake install'
 for Cygwin.)
 
 Although we didn't expect `archsys' to be used in Windows, I can see
 that it might be useful for writing scripts that work in both Unix and
 Cygwin. Since the MzScheme and MrEd executables rely on their current
 locations within the `plt' directory, the best solution is probably to
 add a Cygwin case to archsys and link `plt/.bin/i386-win32' to `../..'.
 I haven't done that, yet.
 
 
 Let me know whether the 100/35 source code works for you.
 
 Matthew
