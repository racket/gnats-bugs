>Description:
The divide-by-zero example given to describe exception handling is broken. Specifically, the exception: exn:application:match:zero? is not understood by DrScheme (I'm using the textual MzScheme language level).  Furthermore, even if it was, it appears to be inconsistent with the documentation later on, which suggests that the relevant exception is exn:application:divide-by-zero, which is also not understood.
>How-To-Repeat:
This code:

(define div-w-inf 
  (lambda (n d) 
    (with-handlers ([exn:application:match:zero?  
                     (lambda (exn) +inf.0)]) 
      (/ n d)))) 

(div-w-inf 1 0)

Gives this error message:

reference to undefined identifier: exn:application:match:zero?

Changing the exception to exn:application:divide-by-zero
gives this error:

exn:application:divide-by-zero: illegal use of syntax in: exn:application:divide-by-zero

What's the right way to do this?

 Thanks for reporting the problem.
 
 `exn:application:divide-by-zero' is correct, but add a `?' to get a
 predicate:
 
  (define div-w-inf 
    (lambda (n d) 
      (with-handlers ([exn:application:divide-by-zero?  
                       (lambda (exn) +inf.0)]) 
        (/ n d)))) 
 
 The docs have been repaired.
