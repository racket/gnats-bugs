>Description:
A rational division with a negative denominator gives incorrect result:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 200alpha12.
Language: Beginning Student.
> (/ 2 4)
0.5
> (/ 2 -4)
-0.5
> (/ 2 3)
.6
> (/ 2 -3)
-1.3
> 

Shouldn't this be -0.6 to match the result of (/ 2 -4) ?
I'm new to Scheme so perhaps my syntax is wrong. I tried
(/ 2 (- 3)) but got the same answer.

 Thanks for the report. 
 
 this is a known bug that has been fixed in a later version (the printer
 is broken -- the actual computations are correct).
 
 Please upgrade.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
