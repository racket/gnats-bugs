>Description:
The documentation for file-position suggests
that it works for "file-stream ports and 
string ports". It looks to me like it works 
fine for byte ports as well. Are there others?
I'll update the docs if there aren't any 
others to add.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(define b-port (open-input-bytes #"abcheo"))
(file-position b-port 3)
(read-byte b-port)

 There's really only one kind of port for character strings and byte
 strings. I'll adjust the documentation to be clearer.
