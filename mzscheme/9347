>Description:
According to R6RS 11.14, the &message field of these are incorrect because "something: " or "#f: " is being prepended but it's only supposed to be exactly what was given to assertion-violation or error.  Also, the compound condition created by assertion-violation includes &error but is not supposed to.  Also, both include &non-continuable but this condition type is only for "indicat[ing] that an exception handler invoked via raise has returned".
>How-To-Repeat:
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs))

(write
 (guard (ex [#t (simple-conditions ex)])
   (assertion-violation 'something "oops" 1 'b #\c)))
(newline) (newline)
(write
 (guard (ex [#t (simple-conditions ex)])
   (error 'something "oops" 1 'b #\c)))
(newline)

(newline) (newline)
(write
 (guard (ex [#t (simple-conditions ex)])
   (assertion-violation #f "oops" 1 'b #\c)))
(newline) (newline)
(write
 (guard (ex [#t (simple-conditions ex)])
   (error #f "oops" 1 'b #\c)))
(newline)
