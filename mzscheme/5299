>How-To-Repeat:
the program below signals an unbound id error
for drscheme:language:text/pos-text
but I think that there aren't any unbound ids.

(module module-language mzscheme
  (require (lib "unitsig.ss"))

  (define-signature drscheme:language^
    ((struct text/pos (text start end) 
             -setters  ;; comment out this line and error goes away
             )))
  
  (define module-language@
    (unit/sig ()
      (import [drscheme:language : drscheme:language^])
      drscheme:language:text/pos-text)))

 `-setters' and `-selectors' were implemented backwards. (Big hole in
 the test suite fixed.)
 
 Committed and exp-tagged.

 Great! Now all *functions* exported to tools are documented and have
 contracts checked. Check out:
 
   plt/collects/drscheme/private/tool-info.ss
 
 and search for `contract' in help desk (you might need a new framework
 manual).
 
 :)
 
 Just have to figure out how I want to write the class-based contracts
 now...
