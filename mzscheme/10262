 There are no contracts in there (and it's even still in mzlib/process,
 and in the mzscheme language).

 Would it be kosher for me to write it in scheme/base and add contracts?

 While rewriting this to use contracts is possible, there are other
 ways to signal this error earlier.  For example, the `string-join'
 function doesn't have a contract, but does check its arguments.

 [Dropped CCs, I didn't intend to leave them earlier.]
 
 The decision is Matthew's, but I don't think that there's any reason
 not to do that, since there's no overhead issues...  It would also be
 good to move it to `scheme/system', and make `mzlib/process' do the
 re-exporting.
 
 As for the paths, I don't think that an answer is obvious: on one
 hand, passing in a path is common enough that I'd expect it to deal
 with them properly (converting them to strings), but on the other hand
 why not do the same for other values too (like numbers and
 symbols)...  And yet another question is whether this should be done
 in this code or in `subprocess' (where IMO it makes the same sense).
