>Description:
If I'm in emacs running mzscheme on windows xp then killing the buffer (and the mzscheme process) brings up a "MzScheme.exe - Application Error" dialogue saying, "The exception unknown exception (0x00000fd) occured in the application at location 0x1000681c. Click on OK to terminate the program". Could this exception be trapped so the dialogue doesn't appear?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:02 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
