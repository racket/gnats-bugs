>Description:
When I attempt to install drscheme on my PPC machine running Gentoo Linux, the configure goes okay, the make completes properly, but the make install gives the following error:

setup-plt: Error during Compiling .zos for Framework (/usr/local/plt/collects/framework)

make[1]: *** [copy-finish] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/plt/src'
make: *** [install] Error 2

There are several more similar errors (approximately 40-50) above, but I suppose this will be enough to begin investigation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download the source,
Unpack the source
cd to the src dir in the source tree
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/plt
make
make install
	Answer yes to all of the questions including the check for online updates, and creating .zo files.

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 02:25:54 -0500
Reason>>> mzscheme
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 02 Jun 2004 12:48:58 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in v207.

The bug was related to printing -0.0 versus +0.0, which was in turn
due to a violation of C99's aliasing rules in the MzScheme source.
