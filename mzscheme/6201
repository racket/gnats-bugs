>Description:
The i-th element of the resulting vector of (build-vector n f)  is (f i), not  (f (- i 1)).     I suppose someone was being helpful, and using the phrase i-th element in the normal English way.  But it's confusing.  Confused me, anyway.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use Help Desk to search for build-vector, click on:
PLT MzLib: Libraries Manual

(build-vector n f) in "etc.ss: Useful Procedures and Syntax"

to see 

(build-vector n f)      PROCEDURE 

Creates a vector of n elements by applying f to the integers from 0 to n - 1 in order, where n is a non-negative integer. The ith element of the resulting vector is (f (- i 1)).
