enter & execute a few times:

(let loop ((x 99))

it will likely not fully display the count-down until it hangs,
and then requires a user-break to terminate the hang.

 Thanks! I had noticed that something was seriously wrong, but I didn't
 have such a succinct and reliable example.
 
 Fixed in CVS.
