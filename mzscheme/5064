>Description:
If you run close-input-port on a port that's already closed, 
you get an exception.

R5RS says (of this and close-output-port)

  These routines have no effect if the file has already been closed.

[It should have said "port" instead of "file" -- another R5RS bug.]

It seems to me that raising an exception is an "effect".  

If we want to leave this in (which might be desirable), it should be
documented.

 For me:

  > (close-input-port s)

 So, can you be more specific?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
