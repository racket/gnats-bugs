>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
(eval 
 (compile
  '(let ([x '(1)])
     x)))

;; the above gives this (with extra newline):

  internal error: non-compact quote compilation
  
  > 

;; the let is just there to make it easier to read.
;; Without the let, the same error occurs, as long
;; as the result of the evaluation is the quoted
;; list.
