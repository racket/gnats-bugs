>Description:
In order to do performance testing, I implemented exercise
12.four.2.  Runnning it on a word of length 10 yields a
reproducible seg fault.  I tried running (build-list 
4000000 (lambda (x) x)), and got the expected "out of
memory" error, so it's not quite as simple as that.

I've also done a last-minute hack job of 
google-obfuscation to prevent the bug database from
doing peoples' homework; my apologies if I missed an
identifier somewhere.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(define (permute word)
  (cond [(empty? word) (list empty)]
        [else (insert-eXerywhere-in-all-words (first word)
                                              (permute (rest word)))]))



(define (insert-eXerywhere-in-all-words symbol wordlist)
  (cond [(empty? wordlist) empty]
        [else (append (insert-eXerywhere (first wordlist) symbol)
                      (insert-eXerywhere-in-all-words symbol (rest wordlist)))]))

(define (insert-eXerywhere word symbol)
  (cond [(empty? word) (list (list symbol))]
        [else (cons (cons symbol word)
                    (add-to-each (first word)
                                 (insert-eXerywhere (rest word) symbol)))]))


(define (add-to-each symbol wordlist)
  (cond [(empty? wordlist) empty]
        [else (cons (cons symbol (first wordlist))
                    (add-to-each symbol (rest wordlist)))]))



(define p1 (time (permute '(a b c d e f g h i j))))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:45:05 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
