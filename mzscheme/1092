the read-char primitive drops characters, i.e. does not read
"the next available character from the input stream" as r4rs
requires.

This is important to me because I'm porting the EOPL sources to
DrScheme

Any help greatly appreciated.

 A possible solution to this problem is to insert `display'ed characters
 after the last-read input character, rather than at the end of the IO
 editor.

 Hi Bill -- 
 
 Here are two comments independent of the software problem: 
 
 Dan Friedman has been using DrScheme recently. He never uses i/o to teach
 the course. Neither does Chris. I know Mitch on occasion does, but I doubt
 he does much of it. 
 
 The team is in the process of finishing a second edition. From what I know,
 they have made sure every program runs in Chez and in DrScheme.

 I don't even understand the problem, really. What do you think he means?

 I suspect he provides something like 'ab' as input, and the 'b' is
 ignored.

 Nah; it works in 100. He has 53. That was the problem
