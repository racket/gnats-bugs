GMT time is displayed instead of local time.
>How-To-Repeat:
Launch Linux version of DrScheme in non-0 offset time zone (other
than GMT time zone).

Time indicated is not local time.

State-Changed-Why:

I haven't been able to reproduce this problem. Version 51 didn't fix
it by chance, did it?

Just to be sure, `date' returns the correct date, right?

If `datye' is right and DrScheme 51 is wrong, I have one more
question: is Linux set up so that the machine clock is in GMT or local
time? (I always use local time so that Linux and Windows cooperate.)

Can't reproduce the problem. Did it go away in later versions of Linux?
