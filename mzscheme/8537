>Description:
Opening the file plt/collects/framework/private/text.ss of svn revision 5642 causes drscheme to freeze.
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
This turns out to be triggered by the new "is this a module" check that triggers automatic setting of the language to the module language in drscheme (as Matthew correctly hypothesized). I narrowed it down to this code:

(define t (new text%))
(send t load-file "/Users/robby/svn/plt/framework/private/text.ss")
(define tp (open-input-text-editor t))
(printf "before\n")
(read tp)
(printf "after\n") 

which prints before, but not after. I sent it to Matthew, who said:

This is not a contract violation. As Matthew reported, fixing the first bug still gets into a deadlock with the code, but it would have been a deadlock with breaks enabled, making it much easier to find.
