>Description:
'unquote' in the second to last entry of a quasiquoted vector causes racket to produce an error.

The reason is that racket tries to use list->vector after converting the  vector as a list. This behavior makes sense for lists as it allows you to unquote the last element producing a potentially improper list. I don't think it makes sense for vectors.

Feel free to WONTFIX. I doubt it will adversely affect any existing or future piece of software.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v5.2.
> `(1 unquote 3)
'(1 . 3)
> `#(1 unquote 3)
list->vector: expected argument of type <proper list>; given '(1 . 3)
