>Description:
when syntax-case is passed a non-list as the second argument, the
the error refers to for-each, and not to syntax-case, and 
there is no errortrace information.  This error arose because 
I typed syntax-case rather than kernel-syntax-case, where #f is
legal.  Why don't I get errortrace info here? It seems that 
syntax-case is getting elaborated into a for-each that has
no source information. 
>How-To-Repeat:
(syntax-case #'here #f)

 do you have .zos compiled? That probably explains the lack of backtrace info.
 
 I tried to explain this problem in a confusing series of messages 
 with Matthew on plt-design, but we didn't really get anywhere.
 
 The problem: if you compile to .zo files, the debugging check box in 
 the language dialog is effectively ignored for those files.

 Because `syntax-case' is built into MzScheme.

 No - the `for-each' is in the implementation of `syntax-case' (i.e.,
 it's used to generate the elaborated expression).
