>Description:
The full path to "racket/private/path" appears in many zo files:

  /var/tmp/racket/collects/racket/private/map.rkt

in the nightly build.

(This is the last one I'll report -- there are others, but many of them are
probably the same as this one, it just happens to be the one that is most
visible.)
