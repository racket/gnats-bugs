>Description:
DrRacket crashes after (it seems) about 15-20 minutes of use, with errors like these:

Seg fault (internal error during gc) at 0x25ba560
SIGSEGV SEGV_ACCERR SI_CODE 2 fault on 0x25ba560

The hex address is different every time, but everything else is the same.
>How-To-Repeat:
Dunno. It seems to happen more when running code or evaluating expressions in the interactions window. However, doing those things also make GC much more likely, so it's probably meaningless.

 Possibly fixed. Can you try the latest?

Reason>>> I think this is probably fixed. SirMail went from
crashing quickly to lasting all day.

 DrRacket lasted two hours this evening, so it looks like it's fixed from 
 here, too.
