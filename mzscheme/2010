>Description:
The documentation does not mention that 
date functions (defined in date.ss) are affected
by the envionment variable TZ.

So 

(putenv "TZ" "GMT0")
(date->string (seconds->date (current-seconds)) #t)
(putenv "TZ" "GMT1")
(date->string (seconds->date (current-seconds)) #t)

will print two different results.

 More specifically, it affects the result of `seconds->date'.
 
 The MzScheme documentation generally doesn't attempt to account for
 platform-specific details, such as how the local time or timezone is
 determined, but I added a footnote.

 Totally right.

 Nice. I guess someone who used C functions such as strftime knows
 about these things. But it is good to know that MzScheme, or some
 other packages, do not try to set the pertinent variables to some
 values or shield the implementation from the surrouding environment.
 A kind of philosophy of Scheme.
