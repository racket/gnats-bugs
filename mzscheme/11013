There's a little bug preventing fileinject from working. Um. Ever. I don't have write access to the central git repository, so here's a patch to fix it. Simple stuff. It's a patch against the most current master as of a few seconds ago, so I don't think anyone has fixed this yet.

 I believe this has already been fixed in the git repo by correcting the
 contract of `install-pkg', instead of changing the call to
 `install-pkg'.

 Yes, the contract was buggy.
 
 Thanks for looking into this, tho!
