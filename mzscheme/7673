>Description:
Hello 

I have dowloaded the latest scr files of DrScheme (PLT 299-400)
for Mac OS-X (Aqua). 
It must be said that I am not a makefile guru anyway these are 'patch' solution that allowed me to finish the compilation.

during the 'make install' (on iBook G4 Mac OS-X 10.3.9) 
there are 2 little problems:

1) It seems the line: 
cp -p -r $(srcdir)/../man $(prefix)/.
doesn't fine the directory so the best way to go on is to comment it..

2) the file PLT_MzScheme.framework is not found in the right location
solution: add the following line to the makefile in the directory src/mzscheme under the label "osx-install": 
cp -r <build_dir>/plt/src/mzscheme/PLT_MzScheme.framework /usr/local/plt
.

Just a final note, I found these 2 problems in the past versions
of DrScheme Source as well.

This is a the error message as it appeared during the installation
of the version 209 (with the current one there is the same problem):

....
make finish-stub
cd /usr/local/plt; ./install
dyld: ./bin/mzscheme can't open library: PLT_MzScheme.framework/Versions/209/PLT_MzScheme  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)make[1]: *** [copy-finish] Error 133 
make: *** [install] Error 2 
....

best regards
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to install DrScheme from source(for OS-X Aqua/X11)
after the "make install" the make should stop with the errors.

 Can you please specify a precise sequence of commands that you have
 used?  Also, a listing of your environment variables would be good.

 Did you use some prefix for configure?
 
 Matthew -- it seems like there are two issues here (down below).  The
 first is that the `man' directory is distributed only with the Unix
 sources, so it's probably better to make the Makefile rule check if
 the directory exists.  Also, if it is common for OSX applications to
 have a `man' then tell me and I will change the distribution specs to
 include that directory for mac distros too.
 
 The second issue is that the framework stuff is not going to the right
 place.  My guess is that this is a problem that my build doesn't run
 into because I don't use the standard prefix installation thing.
 (Is the usual prefix even useful for an OSX installation?)

 OK, so this is the source of the problem.

 Ok - I will look into this soon.

 I think it makes sense to include it.

 The prefix is not currently used for the frameworks. Right now, they
 have to go into ~/Library/Frameworks or /Library/Frameworks so that
 they can be found. (We may want to change the way the binaries are
 linked, however, so that the frameworks can be put into plt/lib.)

 This part is finally done.
