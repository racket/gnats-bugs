>Description:
I tried looking at the MzScheme man page, using

  nroff -man mscheme.1

and also with

  man mzscheme

after setting MANPATH.

In both cases, although it's in the source, the
"collection" argument to -L doesn't show up.

 Fixed and exp-tagged. It's a bit disturbing that nroff on Solaris and
 Linux produce different results, though.
