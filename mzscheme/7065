>Description:
http://syrma:8125/servlets/submit.ss?jlasdf%Tjokasdf will produce the server error message:

bytes: expects type <exact integer in [0,255]> as 7th argument, given: #f; other arguments were: 106 108 97 115 100 102 111 107 97 115 100 102

This seems to come from string->url:

> (require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
> (string->url "http://syrma:8125/servlets/submit.ss?jlasdf%Tjokasdf")
bytes: expects type <exact integer in [0,255]> as 7th argument, given: #f; other arguments were: 106 108 97 115 100 102 111 107 97 115 100 102

(Error message appears in the Web server output on the terminal.)
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
I've fixed string->url. I don't think that it should ever be raising an exception.
Now, it just drops the stuff after the "%". 
>Release-Note:
This is a contract violation

 Someone already assigned this to GregP, but given that the bug was in
 string->url, I just went ahead and fixed it. I don't think that
 string->url should ever raise an exception. In this case, it now just
 drops the funny chars after the "%".
