Linux
>Description:
I compiled from source on a Powerbook G3 running Linux 2.4.9, gcc-2.95 and glibc 2.1.3 (I think). This combination worked.  After upgrading to gcc 3.0.2 and glibc 2.2.4, I got a segmentation fault at line 589 of os_dep.c in mzscheme.  This
happened both in the old executable and in a new executable compiled after
the upgrade. I note that there is no seg fault on an Linux/x86 machine
with glibc 2.2.2, so perhaps the problem is on my end.
