 Hi,
 
 First off, I tried to submit this bug report via the web interface, but I
 got this:
 
 Internal Server Error
 
 The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
 
 Please contact the server administrator, steck@ccs.neu.edu and inform them of the time the error occurred, and
 anything you might have done that may have caused the error.
 
 More information about this error may be available in the server error log.
 
 
 Apache/1.3.12 Ben-SSL/1.39 Server at bugs.plt-scheme.org Port 80
 
 
 Consider that another bug report :-)
 
 Now on to business:
 
 I downloaded, configured and compiled DrScheme v200a9 on my computer
 running Debian Linux.  There didn't appear to be any problems.  I su'd to
 root and ran "make install", which should have installed everything in
 /usr/local/plt (which is the prefix I asked for).  I get this:
 
 tap:/home/mvanier/lang/scheme/PLT/plt/src# make install
 if [ ! -d /usr/local/plt ] ; then mkdir /usr/local/plt ; fi
 cp -r ./../collects /usr/local/plt/collects
 if [ normal-install = "normal-install" ] ; then cp -r ./../bin /usr/local/plt/bin ; fi
 cp -r ./../lib /usr/local/plt/lib
 cp: cannot stat `./../lib': No such file or directory
 
 which is correct, since there is no plt/lib directory.
 
 Mike
