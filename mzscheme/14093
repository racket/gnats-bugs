>Description:
It seems like invoke-unit doesn't like picking up imports from the context when the signature contains a struct. 

Here is one example that's a little bit more complicated than just that in order to more obviously match a problem I'm seeing in drracket (just in case there is something else going on in this case).

#lang racket/base
(require racket/unit)

(struct p:s ())
(define p:struct:s struct:p:s)

(define-signature s1^
  ((struct s ())))

(define-signature s2^
  ((open (prefix p: s1^))))

(define-values/invoke-unit 
  (unit (import s2^) (export))
  (import s2^)
  (export))

;; => p:s2: unbound identifier in module
;; but I don't expect an error here.
