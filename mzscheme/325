 That other name also shows up in error messages:
 
   > (collection-path)
   procedure find-collection: expects at least 1 argument, given 0
 
 BTW, why doesn't collection-path take no arguments? It seems like it should
 default to the same thing require-library does.

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed. collection-path was implemented by a letrec-bound procedure,
and the letrec variable was `find-collection'. Also, the call to
`raise-type-error' used 'find-collection.
