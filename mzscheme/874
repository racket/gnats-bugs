I haven't tried to fully build from the source release, but for some
reason the mzdyn.obj files in the binary release are old versions (52).

More info
In plt/src/mzscheme/dynsrc for the *source* release, running the
gmkmzdyn.bat & mkmzdyn.bat script fails due to directories
not being created for the "copy" commands.

>How-To-Repeat:
cd plt/collects/mzscheme/examples
mzc --cc hello.c
mzc --ld hello.dll hello.obj

mzscheme
(load-extension "hello.dll")
load-extension: bad version 52 from "hello.dll"

(with MS VC++ 5 in path!)

 Sorry for the exceptionally long delay in replying.

 I see that the gcc .obj files are very old, and I'll fix that for
 100alpha2. But the msvc files appear to be up-to-date. If you're
 interested in pursuing this, could you run
 
  mzc -v --cc hello.c
  mzc -v --ld hello.dll hello.obj
 
 with msvc's cl.exe in your path? The -v flag will make mzc print out
 the command line it uses to invoke the compiler.

 Thanks - I'll fix that for 100alpha2, too.
