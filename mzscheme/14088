>Description:
It took a while to figure out why "plot-lib" depended on "plot-gui-lib", because of messages like this:

  raco setup: found undeclared dependency:
  raco setup:   mode: run
  raco setup:   for package: "plot-lib"
  raco setup:   on package: "plot-gui-lib"
  raco setup:   dependent source: decoration_rkt.zo
  raco setup:   used module: (lib "plot/main.rkt")

I have four "decoration.rkt" files: for 2D and 3D decorations, and Typed Racket wrappers for both. I usually forget the latter exist, but that's where the problem was.

If it had output this instead, I would have found the unwanted dependency immediately:

  raco setup:   dependent source: plot/typed/private/plot2d/decoration.rkt
