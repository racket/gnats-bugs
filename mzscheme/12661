 Hi,
 
 I submitted a github pull request with a possible patch. A possibly
 better, or complimentary, approach would be to detect and handle big
 float -> integer conversion overflow in default_sleep()
 (racket/src/port.c) but the code in check_sleep() seems to be trying
 to address the problem already, with a comment to that effect, so the
 fix is there.
