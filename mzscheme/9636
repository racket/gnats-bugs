>Description:
In the R6RS test suite for PLT Scheme, tests/r6rs/syntax-case.sls
contains three incorrect tests.  Here are the three expressions
for those tests together with their outcomes in the current
(post-0.962, pre-0.963) development version of Larceny, running
in ERR5RS mode:

> (syntax->datum '(a . b)) 
Error: syntax->datum: A symbol is not a valid syntax object a

> (syntax->datum '(a b))
Error: syntax->datum: A symbol is not a valid syntax object a

> (syntax->datum '#(a b))
Error: syntax->datum: A symbol is not a valid syntax object a

In each of those messages, the irritant is the symbol a.
(Larceny's error reports are even less clear in ERR5RS
mode than in R6RS mode.)  From the recursive definition of
syntax objects in R6RS Library section 12.2, it is clear
that a pair, list, or vector that contains a symbol is
not a syntax object.  From R6RS Library section 12.6, it
is then clear that such pairs, lists, or vectors are not
legal arguments to syntax->datum.

>How-To-Repeat:
Any system that uses Andre van Tonder's implementation of
syntax-case will reproduce the problem.  I believe the
problem can be reproduced by using Larceny v0.962 to run
syntax-case.sps in isolation, but the issue with these
three tests was hard to see when there were 21 (out of 24)
genuine errors in the output.

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sat, 26 Jul 2008 16:38:16 -0400
Reason>>> Each 'a in those tests was supposed to be 1, and each 'b
was supposed to be 2. Fixed in SVN.

Thanks for the report!
