>Description:
The program below produces the following error:

mzlib/compile.rkt:9:2: build-path: expects type <path, string, 'up, 'same> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: "compiled"

#lang racket

(require mzlib/compile)
(define (scheme-file? s)
    (regexp-match ".*[.](rkt|ss|scm)" (path->string s)))
 (define (compile-benchmarks)
    (define (find dir)
      (for/list ([d (directory-list dir)]
                 #:when (scheme-file? d))
        d))
    (define shootout (find (collection-path "tests" "racket" "benchmarks" "shootout" "typed")))
    (define common (find (collection-path "tests" "racket" "benchmarks" "common" "typed")))
    (define shootout-tests
      (list "compiling"
            (for/list ([p (append shootout common)])
              (list (path->string p)
                    (list (compile-file p))))))

    )
 (compile-benchmarks)
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
This program is buggy. The paths returned by directory-list are baseless paths... ie #<path:ackermann-non-optimizing.rkt> rather than something like #<path:/Users/jay/Dev/scm/plt/collects/tests/racket/benchmarks/shootout/typed/ackermann-non-optimizing.rkt>. Thus 'p' does not refer to any actual file.

There should be a better error message and I've started a discussion about it.

For now, change 'd' in the for/list to '(build-path dir d)' and it will work.
