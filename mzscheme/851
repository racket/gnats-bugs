>Description:
When pasting sexpressions into the mzscheme repl on the mac, sometimes the
repl gets stuck.
>How-To-Repeat:
copy the following sexpression:

(define (repl)
  (printf " --> ")
  (flush-output)
  (let* ((r (read))
         (a (assq r COMMANDS)))
    (if a
        (begin
          ((cadr a))
          (repl))
        (begin
          (printf "~s is not a legitimate command. Please try again. " r)
          (repl)))))


paste it into the mzscheme repl and type return. MzScheme does not accept
the sexpression and seems to get stuck.

Shorter expressions do not have this problem.

State-Changed-Why:

CodeWarrior's SIOUX is broken. It's some sort of buffering
problem. Any inpout over 256 characters makes the console get stuck.
