State-Changed-Why:
MzScheme's local is indeed different from Rice Scheme's local (as the
documentation correctly explains). local was written a long time ago
as a hack to run Rice Scheme programs in MzScheme.  Fortunately,
MzScheme now has enough macro hacks that I can implement the expected
local.
