 Here's a simpler version:
 
   #lang racket
   (require 2htdp/image)
   (car (circle 20 "solid" "red"))
 
 or
 
   (add1 <insert an image here>)
 
 I think that this requires a change at the level that controls how ~e
 works. Specifically, the error-value->string handler seems to preclude
 the use of non-text stuff.
 
 ... but I thought we figured out a way to plug all these leaks so
 maybe I've just forgotten the right handler?
