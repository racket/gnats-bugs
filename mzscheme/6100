>Description:
It would be useful to have a functional string-lowercase in MzLib (ditto string-uppercase).  While it's easy to build 
my own from the imperative version, I think many would 
find it useful.

SRFI 13 has these, using the names string-{up,down}case.
There are also imperative variants.  Those names are 
similar to the R5RS char-{up,down}case, so perhaps 
better-chosen than the MzLib names.  Maybe it's a good 
idea to use those names.

Reason>>> Matthew, I'm passing it to you so you can decide what you
want to do (adding non-destructive versions is reasonable,
but I don't know if you'll want to change the names too). 
In any case, pass it back to me and I will do it -- I want
to get a chance to go over a few basic files in mzlib, and
this will be a good excuse to dive in...

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 06 Jul 2006 15:18:07 -0400
Reason>>> Eventually added in v350
