> (list-tail lst pos)
> Returns the list after the first pos elements of lst. If the list has pos or fewer elements, then the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

"pos or fewer" should instead read "fewer than pos", as (list-tail x (length x)) returns null, as I would think it should

(the 3.99.0.17 documentation on the web is the same)
>How-To-Repeat:
> (list-tail '() 0)
()

> (list-tail '(1 2 3 4 5) 5)
()

Reason>>> fixed in SVN --- thanks for the report!
