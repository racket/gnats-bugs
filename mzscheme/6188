>Description:
Currently, we can write

  (require (lib "list.ss"))

to refer to the list.ss file in the mzlib
collection.  Implicitly, this one-argument
form of `lib' refers to the mzlib collection.

Frequently I find myself writing code of the 
form

  (require (lib "x.ss" "x"))

for collection x.  It would be ever-so-slightly
easier to write

  (require (lib "x"))

instead.  Of course, there's potential confusion
with the other one-argument form of lib.  The 
implementation could first check whether there's 
a collection with the name "x" and a file 
"x.ss" within it; if not, then see whether "x" is 
in the mzlib collection.
