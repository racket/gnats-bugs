>Description:
MrEd has several preferences (for instance, MrEd:doubleClickTime), which, according to the manual, are case-sensitive.  However when I enter one of these preferences into my plt-prefs.ss file, like so:

 (MrEd:doubleClickTime 250)

Not only does this not have the desired effect, but I get this in the REPL:

> (get-preference 'MrEd:doubleClickTime)
#f
> (get-preference 'mred:doubleclicktime)
1000

If I open the plt-prefs.ss file, I find this:

 (mred:doubleclicktime 1000)

So somewhere, DrScheme is forcing symbols to lowercase (why??) when rewriting this file.  I've noticed this both upon start and exit.

 You can put a case-sensitive entry in your plt-prefs.ss file by 
 enclosing the symbol with vertical bars, like so:
 
    (|MrEd:doubleClickTime| 250)

 This reply is like one of those bad jokes about mathematicians.
 
 You do get the *point* behind this bug report, right?

 It isn't as bad as you make out, Shriram -- the original poster was
 breaking the abstraction and monkeying with the internal
 representations. We shouldn't be surprised if the internal
 representations are strange sometimes. (In this case, the strangeness
 is due to backwards compatibility issues.) That is, the file could
 easily just have been some encoded funnyness that the preferences
 library interprets and then he wouldn't have even tried editing the
 file, I presume.

 Aha.  So the right reply then is, "Don't touch that file!  To get that
 same effect, do ... instead".

 That sounds right, but I also read the bug report as saying that the
 file format isn't documented, and I should go document it.

 Maybe the file can say at the top, "For case-sensitive options,
 enclose them in |...|"?

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "doc-bug" by samth at Tue, 07 Feb 2012 16:54:56 -0500
Reason>>> The remaining bug here is for Matthew to document the
preferences file format, I believe.
