>Description:
When I click execute, my program runs to completion.  It prints
out a text box from the one printf in my program, and I get a prompt
back.  Then, sometimes, if I wait 5-10 seconds, I get an internal error
message in a separate window.  Here are the errors I've had so far:

Internal Error: procedure application: expected procedure, given: (#(struct:zodiac #f #(struct:location 3 2 84 #<object>) #(struct:location 8 12 305 #<object>))) (no arguments)
Internal Error: procedure application: expected procedure, given: #<bad-value> (no arguments)
Internal Error: procedure application: expected procedure, given: (#\m #\d #\e #\f) (no arguments)

 This one suggests that the problem is a mred bug, which will be fixed
 by the next release, probably this evening. It's a memory bug due to a
 misuse of the collector routines.

 I expect this problem to have disappeared with the 52/3 release. Does
 it still happen?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
