>Description:
In DrScheme with language level set to Graphical
Full Scheme:

`(1 . #0=null)
`(2 . #0=3)

works as I expect, evaluating to (1) and (2 . 3).

#;`(1 . #0=null)
`(2 . #0=3)

Gives the error

read: multiple #0= tags

when I would expect that the first #0= would be
totally ignored.

 That's interesting.
 
 Technically, it's consistent with the documented behavior, though it
 never occurred to me you don't need some other pair of parens grouping
 the comment with an S-expression after it.
