 Unfortunately, this is a choice we made about the way to interpret certain
 file names long ago and it isn't something we can easily change.
 
 You might find that posting on the mailing list with some more specifics
 will lead to others who can help you work around the larger problems you're
 having.
 
 Sorry,

 I think we should be able to fix this by considering "racket f.ext" to
 be like (require (file "f.ext")) and not (require f), but I may
 misunderstand something.
