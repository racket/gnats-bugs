Re: my previous report

I guess this should have been obvious -- my problem *was*
that reading from stdin blocks threads on the mac version.
It's the read-eval-print loop that's doing the reading --
I was only thinking of user calls to (read) when I read your
warning on this. I grabbed the SunOS version and all of my
code works as expected :-)

Thanks for making this available!
