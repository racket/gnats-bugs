 I just tried that, and everything seems to be working fine.  Maybe you
 have some old plt installation that somehow mixed things up?

 The autoconf scripts are designed to silently omit compilation of the 
 #%foreign module when those sources are not present.  However, the most 
 recent versions of mzlib will not compile (as seen here) without it.
 
 While I don't know exactly what caused the autoconf decision not to 
 compile foreign in your case (in my case, I needed to check out 
 additional source subtrees through CVS), our configure script needs to 
 be modified to fail when these sources are not present, since setup-plt 
 depends on its success.[*]

 [*] alternately, we could take files that depend on #%foreign out of 
 the standard build process...

 It is still possible to build mzscheme without the foreign sources,
 and it's a property I'd like to keep for a while (esp while working on
 stuff, and we are working on lightning which is in the same place).
 In any case, it only ignores it when the src/foreign is not present,
 which should not happend.  I didn't think of a way that this could
 have happened but now I realize that I didn't add the src/foreign
 directory to the (source) distribution, I'll do that now.
 
 Question for "rsheridan6@hotmail.com": did you get the sources from
 the pre-release page?

 It appears to me that you didn't address the following issue: how can 
 setup-plt complete successfully if mzscheme doesn't contain #%foreign?  
 The compilation of mzlib's "foreign.ss" is guaranteed to fail, unless 
 you move it into the 'compile-omit-files' list, right?
 
 Or did you literally mean that you wanted to preserve _only_ the 
 property that mzscheme builds successfully, and are not concerned about 
 maintaining the property that setup-plt also succeed without the 
 foreign sources?

 Yes -- if src/foreign is not there, mzscheme still compiles, but if
 you want a normal full build then you will get a failure down the
 road.  This would be bad if it took me some time to figure out why
 #%foreign wasn't included, which is not the case now.  Later, when
 lightning is also added, and once there is one official release
 including it so I know that there are no major compilation problems on
 all platforms -- there will be no need for the silent ignoring thing
 and it should be removed.

 You can turn the compile time error into a runtime one with a module
 like this:
 
   (module foreign mzscheme
     (define export1 (with-handlers ... (dynamic-require #%foreign 'export1)))
     ...)
 
 in (lib "foreign.ss") or something like that.
 
 This is what lets  (lib "mred.ss" "mred") compile, for example.

When the current build finishes you should be able to

 I'm impressed to see my bug fixed in 2 days.  My experience with reporting 
 bugs in open source projects has often been quite different.
