>Description:
DrRacket is automatically converting required files that end in ".rkt" into ".ss"
>How-To-Repeat:
Create three files, all in the same directory:

In the first: (require "a.rkt")
in "a.rkt": (display "In a.rkt")
in "a.ss": (display "In a.ss")

Run the first file, and "In a.ss" will be displayed, instead of "In a.rkt"
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by mflatt at Wed, 24 Nov 2010 17:56:37 -0500
Reason>>> confusing, but as intended

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 24 Nov 2010 17:56:37 -0500
Reason>>> That behavior is as intended. It's not ideal, but it's
the best we could work out for transitioning from ".ss"
to ".rkt".
