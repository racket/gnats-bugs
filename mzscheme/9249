>Description:
This was working fine, then went bad and now it happens every time. I believe requiring any planet lib will do, and it doesn't matter whether it's cached locally or not. I haven't tried a reboot yet.

 I think you meant
 
   (require (planet "html.scm" ("soegaard" "web.plt" 1 0)))
                                                    
 with the `1 0' inside the same parens as "web.plt".
 
 Of course, you should get an error message instead of a seg fault.
 Thanks very much for the report.
 
 Matthew

Reason>>> `planet' path checking fixed in SVN (missing a `string?' check
before trying to parse the string content)
