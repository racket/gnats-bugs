>Description:
gcc 4.0.2 spits out quite a few warnings when compiling under linux (in this case Ubuntu Breezy). Ideally, these should be taken care of by cleaning up the code, or at least the build system should mask these if they are 'known' issues.

Reason>>> I've finally switched to gcc 4.x, so the warnings 
(lots of signed-versus-unsigned) have been fixed.
