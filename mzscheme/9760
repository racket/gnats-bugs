>Description:
Using set! on an identifier that was provided with a contract gives a bad error message:

-----

#lang scheme/load

(module m1 scheme
  (provide/contract [foo number?])
  (define foo 4))

(require 'm1)
(set! foo 4)

----

The error is:

. . procedure application: expected procedure, given: 4; arguments were: 4 4
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try running the code above.
>Fix:
The bug was that the set! check wasn't happening in the transformer.
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation directly, altho it generated code that produced contract violations.

Definitely not a type error (altho it would have generated type incorrect programs).
