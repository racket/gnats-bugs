>Description:
An apology: as a memory management guy, I hate to submit 
a bug like this (Larceny also simply dies when you try 
to allocate an object that is too large, and its limit 
on size is currently lower than PLT's, I think).
But since you handle the first few cases, I suspect
the eventual death may reflect a real bug; so I submit.

The bug is: the REPL is correctly rejecting attempts 
to allocate large objects that exhaust memory, but 
with (sufficently large) number of repetitions of 
such rejected attempts causes the virtual machine 
itself to run out of memory and abort.

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

The crash happened essentially because a counter
was incremented before the lower-level allocation call
that fails, and the counter wasn't decremented on failure.
There was also an associated memory leak.

Thanks for the report!
