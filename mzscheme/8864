>Description:
I recently uninstalled v350 from a Windows XP Pro machine, and installed v370.  Upon the first running of DrScheme, after a few seconds, a shell window popped up with a stream of seg fault error message.  Closing the shell window kills the entire DrScheme window.

I uninstalled v370, and tried v370.7, with the same result.

Eventually, I was forced to v350 which worked fine.

My guess is that Scheme runs a background task upon the initial running of a fresh install to compile libraries behind the scenes, and that this compilation process is failing.  Maybe the v350 uninstall is leaving around some bogus information in the registry which is messing with v370?
>How-To-Repeat:
Reproduces consistently on my machine :) .
On another XPPRO computer, try installing v350, uninstalling it, and then installing v370.   Don't know whether this will reproduce it.
