>Description:
After v299 alpha is available, I did heavy test on my MrMathematica with 
it, surprisingly finding that it is UNSTABLE, under both Windows and 
Linux.

After many testing, I believe the bug lives in PLT Scheme v299.100. The 
four attached file can show the problem, but a Mathematica is needed to 
run the test. 

To exposure the problem, I *downgrade* MrMathematica to using PLT Scheme 
v209. MrMathematica works fine with DrScheme v209.

The only major difference between v209 and v300 of MrMathematica is in 
String (there is a minor difference about case-sensitive). And the my test
cases are just the same. But the system often crashs when runing the 
"test-v300".

I once doubted that "MathGetString" of "ml.c" in my code causes memory-
leaking. But change it to extremely conservative one only ensure 
(string->number (MathGetString ...)), while the system still crashs 
on other cases.
