>Description:
According to R6RS-Lib 12.9, the compound condition created by syntax-violation should have a &who condition, the &message's message should not have a prepended who string, and the &syntax's subform should be usable.  See my example.  If 'Me is used as the who instead of #f, the &who is still missing.  #'x isn't making it into the &syntax's subform field.  And I don't think it should have an &error.  [A lot of my unit tests' exception tests check for message and who values equality.]
>How-To-Repeat:
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs) (rnrs eval))

(write
 (guard (ex [#t (simple-conditions ex)])
   (eval '(let ()
            (define-syntax S 
              (lambda (stx)
                (syntax-case stx () 
                  [(_ x) 
                   (syntax-violation #;#f 'Me "my custom message" stx #'x)
                   1])))
            (S 2)) 
         (environment '(rnrs)))))
