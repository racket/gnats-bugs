Presuming that you MzScheme language and inside manuals are done
in TeX, I'd appreciate it if I could get the TeX files for the docyumantation.
The reason for this is that should I add some custom components to
MzScheme I'd like the ability to modif the docs.

Thanks.

 We prefer to keep our document sources internal.  You can always modify
 the HTML versions.
