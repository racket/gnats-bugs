 You have to be aware of the nature of `read' -- it reads in a single
 Scheme expression and nothing more.  This is essential because when
 you have
 
   (1 2 3)
 
 on the line, `read' will call itself recursively, so it reads in the
 three numbers, and then the first `read' combines them into a list.
 Because of this it doesn't read any characters it doesn't need to and
 if you have a line with
 
   1 2 3
 
 and use `read' twice, it will read in two numbers and leave the third
 for the next read.
 
 If you want to skip a line, you can use `read-line' which reads the
 current line as a string (making the read head go to the next line),
 but mixing `read' and `read-line' is probably not a good idea.
 
 In any case, this is not a bug, so I am closing it.
