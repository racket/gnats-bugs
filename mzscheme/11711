>Description:
Currently subprocess (and wrappers) do not allow arguments to be bytes even though string arguments need to be converted to bytes before passed to the operating system for spawning the subprocess (at least in *nix). This is useful when passing paths to subprocesses, since path->string is lossy.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(define (rm path)
 (system* "rm" (path->bytes path)))

(rm (make-temporary))
