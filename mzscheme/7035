>Description:
Since there's no other way of reliably marshalling
and unmarshalling values, people tend to use `write'
and `read'. But `write' does not properly marshall
some kinds of values (eg closures, uninterned 
symbols). It would be very useful if `write' could
be instructed to raise an error on these kinds of 
values rather than silently producing a string that
`read' can't convert back to the original value.

 Time to upgrade to v299. The parameter you want is `print-unreadable'.
