in drracket after editing the definitions window code and not saving; when code is run, place refers to the code on last save
>How-To-Repeat:
I opened a file test.rkt with the following code
#lang racket
(require racket/place)
(define x (place test (place-channel-put test 1)))

when I run (place-channel-get x) in the repl it returns 1 as expected, however if I replace the 1 with 6, and run the code without saving, and then run (place-channel-get x) in the repl it still returns the 1 and not the 6

 I think that there is no way around this, unfortunately. The 'place'
 form docs could be improved in this regard, tho.
