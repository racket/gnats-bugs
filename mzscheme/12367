>Description:
There doesn't appear to be any index entry in either the Racket Guide or the Racket Reference for "comments".  The index entry in the reference is "reading comments". There doesn't appear to be an entry in the guide. I found all the  information on how to insert Racket comments in a program by finding the entry for ";" in the Racket Reference which led me to section 1.3.8 Reading Comments .  Doing a "search manuals" on ""comments" did not lead me to this section.  So someone completely new to Racket would have a very hard time finding this information.  I don't know if there is information in the Racket Guide about comments, but I couldn't find and index entry for it.
