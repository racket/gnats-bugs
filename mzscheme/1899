Some exact fractions are read in wrong (or maybe printed wrong?)

Welcome to MzScheme version 199.3, Copyright (c) 1995-2001 PLT

The result should have been:

  31415926535/10...

This also seems to happen when the fractional version of this number
is typed in.

 Not a bug. MzScheme prints fractions in normal form (i.e. the form a
 3rd-grader would expect).

 Oh, I got confused by the leading 628 -- I didn't notice that there 
 were fewer digits. Sorry.
