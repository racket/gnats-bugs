>Description:

When you block mzscheme on a semaphore with two threads that sleep, it
takes up lots of CPU. This only seems to happen in scripts mode.

Actually, it seems to do it all of the time, nothing to do with script
mode...

- The problem is related to timed sleeps. When two threads use timed
  sleeping, each incorrectly decides that the other needs to run. This
  uncessary thread-switching keeps the MsScheme process from going to
  sleep.

>How-To-Repeat:

This script does the trick:

     #!/bin/sh

     string=? ; exec mzscheme -x -qgr $0 "$@"

     (require-library "macro.ss")
     (define base "/home/robby/packages/zephyr/periodic")
     (thread (rec loop (lambda () (sleep 3) (loop))))
     (thread (rec loop (lambda () (sleep 3) (loop))))
     (semaphore-wait (make-semaphore 0))

It doesn't seem to happen when I load a file containing that, only when I
run it as a script.

>Fix:
	
Fixed MzScheme's next-thread function to use the correct thread
filed in determing a sleep timeout.

 I don't understand. The two threads in the example script are both
 looping.

 They sleep!
