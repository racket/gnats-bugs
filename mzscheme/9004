>Description:
On my WinXP laptop, which has IE7 installed, if I
try to run the MysterX from either DrScheme or MzScheme, 
I get an error like "Can't create browser window".
In DrScheme, if I re-run the demo, DrScheme hangs, 
and I have to kill it using the Windows task manager.

It looks like this message is coming from mxmain.dll, 
which is the compiled (bletcherous) C code behind 
MysterX.  I don't have sources here right now, so 
I can't guess what's up.

Actually, if I just try running 

  (make-object mx-browser%) 

I get the same error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "mxdemo.ss" "mysterx"))
