>Description:
For including libraries using define-runtime-path, it would be sometimes be useful to be able to get the word size of the current system. Suggestion:

(system-type 'word-size)

returns the word size of the current system, i.e. 32 for a 32bit and 64 for a 64bit architecture system.

Or, perhaps it should return symbols instead of numbers -- I'm not sure about this.

 Correction:
 
 It probably should rather return the word-size for which the running
 version of racket was compiled, i.e. whether it's a 32 or a 64 bit
 version of Racket, and not the actual word-size of the system.

 You may find compiler-sizeof from ffi/unsafe useful. For example, on a 
 64-bit machine:
 
  > (compiler-sizeof '*) ;; ie, pointer
 8
