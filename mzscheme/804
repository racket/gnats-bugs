 True. The intent is that you have to download the MzScheme source code
 to get the library. No doubt this needs to be cleared up in the
 documentation somewhere - can you point me to a place?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 My problem is that our gcc installation has a broken "stdargs",
 and I cannot build the libraries (or mzscheme itself).
 I was hoping to avoid having to rebuild gcc.
 Are there any problems with having libgc and libmzscheme
 in the binary distribution?

 Extensions and embedding are documented in the introduction to "Inside MzScheme". The latest version of this document does mention
 having to compile the library, but does not go into details.

 Well, we can at least solve the immediate problem. I put libmzscheme.a
 and libgc.a in ftp.cs.rice.edu/public/mflatt/sparc_solaris_53/.

 Mainly the size, which is an extra 3 MB uncompressed. 
 
 The idea was that compiling libmzscheme.a shouldn't be a problem for
 someone using mzc, since it requires a compiler anyway. I hadn't
 considered how minimally the compiler has to work... :)

 Thanks a lot.

 I would prefer not to have to consider it either :) (or is that :( ?).
