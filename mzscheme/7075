>Release:        299.19
>Environment:
windows-2000
>Description:
Seems like some code is normalizing file names on Windows to generate
the module identifiers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following text in a file named "Abc.ss":

  (module Abc mzscheme
    (provide a)
    (define a 'aAa))

then try to (require (file "Abc.ss")), mzscheme complains about not
finding the `abc' module.
