I downloaded the unix source for the prerelease and tried to build it according to the README:

make
make install

>cp -p -r ./../include /usr/local/plt/.
>cp: cannot stat `./../include': No such file or directory

 Matthew, the problem is that the install target does the copytree
 first and only then does an install in mzscheme.  This reveals a minor
 bug that pre-existed -- collects/mzscheme/lib/mzdyn.c is copied only
 after the collects tree is copied to $prefix.

 That should be fixed now.
 
 Matthew -- I've moved the copytree target after the mzintsall and the
 mredinstall, this should make it possible for them to do anything
 before the tree is copied.  The only other change that was needed for
 that was to make sure that $(prefix) exists before everything else, so
 I moved that single thing to the beginning of the install-normal goal.
