 That's actually the correct behavior: turning off the parameter just
 means that bars are treated as literal characters, so that symbol's
 printed representation is three characters, and it would be only one
 with the parameter turned off:

 Better:
 
   > (string->symbol "x y")
   |x y|
   > (read-accept-bar-quote #f)
   > (symbol->string '|x|)
   "|x|"
   > (string->symbol "x y")
   x\ y
 
 You probably missed the "printing" in "a boolean value that controls
 parsing and printing a vertical bar".

 Ah, thanks, I misunderstood the documentation.  I was hoping that
 setting the parameter to false would disallow leading vertical bars
 altogether (which is what R5.97RS requires).  Is it possible to do
 this?

 Yes -- make a readtable that sets #\| to a non-terminating macro,
 that just throws an error.  Making it non-terminating means that it
 behaves as part of the symbol when inside one.

 Thanks!  This "bug" can be closed of course.  I would suggest that you
 list the examples you showed me in the documentation of the default
 reader (11.2.4).  They were helpful.
