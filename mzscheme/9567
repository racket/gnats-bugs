>Description:
I don't know what the extra 5 arguments to pp-list are supposed to be, or else I would just fix this, but there are three call sites to pp-list that have the wrong number of args. Below is an example that triggers the bug for one of them.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require scheme/pretty)
(define-struct s (a b) #:inspector #f)
(parameterize ([pretty-print-columns 40])
  (pretty-print 
   (make-s
    'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)))

 I noticed this this morning also, with a simpler expression:
 
   (make-vector 100)
 
 -- 
           ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (x x)))          Eli Barzilay:

 Yeah, and there should be one more input that fails (for 3 different
 calls to pp-list).
 
 (Your example requires one to set up a REPL, I believe -- I wanted to
 cut all that out for the test suite.)
