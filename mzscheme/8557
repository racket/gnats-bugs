Warning	1	warning C4018: '>=' : signed/unsigned mismatch	c:\Users\gurganbl\Documents\Dr. Scheme\src\mzscheme\src\read.c	5157	

The problem comparison is:
l >= ut->rp->symtab_size

l is signed
ut->rp->symtab_size is unsigned

If l is negative, it is caught by the l < 0 check, so the value of l is either zero or positive. That range fits safely in an unsigned long type, so my proposal to fix this warning is to make the comparison:

(unsigned long) l >= ut->rp->symtab_size

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
