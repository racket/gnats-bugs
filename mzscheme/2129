system* doesn't appear to work under Windows 2000

I noticed the problem when running Setup PLT on the mysterx
collection, which uses system*.  I believe that used to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
(system "ls -l") works on a MzScheme in a Cygwin window

ditto for

 (system "ls")

but

 (system* "ls)

and

 (system* "ls" "-l")

do not -- they return #f

 They're not supposed to work unless "ls" is in the current directory.
 The "*" forms want exact executable paths.
