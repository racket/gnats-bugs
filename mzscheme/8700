>Description:
Under Mac OS X, and PLT 370, there seems to be a bug in the primitive procedure file-or-directory-permissions.  When run under sudo, it throws an exception as if the file didn't exist.  I haven't tried it under Linux.

I ran into this while trying to sudo the plt-web-server. It wouldn't start.

 When the current users is root under Mac OS X, the system access()
 function fails on X_OK (with EPERM) when the file's permission don't
 include executable for any user or group. That doesn't happen under
 Linux.
 
 I don't understand why Mac OS X behaves this way, but it's easy enough
 to detect this special case and take it to mean that the file is not
 executable. I've committed the change in SVN for future versions.
