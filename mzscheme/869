in MzScheme:

seams like someone forgot to set the dgc_count when the growing
the dgc-stuff.

And since this is only used from guile emulation stuff this
isn't really used (unless you write a externsion that tries 
to use it)

Shouldn't there be a free() somewhere in there ?

Thanks for a scheme that is accully has some documentation

 Yep.
 
 > Shouldn't there be a free() somewhere in there ?
 
 MALLOC_N() is a macro that calls scheme_malloc(), so no free() is
 needed - the old array is GCed.
 
 Thanks for the patch!
