 Too few brackets.  The [:lower:] is the character class itself.  It
 goes inside the [].  So you could, for instance, combine them:
 [[:lower:]0-9[:upper:]] should match alphanumeric characters.

 The very weird results in the above test should have been a thick
 hint...

 I think that there's a clear problem on the page though.  This thing
 is tricky to see, except for people who are used to these classes (and
 my guess is that there are very few of them).  However, I never found
 a good place on the docs that will clarify that.  My guess is that
 many people just look at the big syntax table at the top, and getting
 an explanation there will be difficult.
 
 (I'll close this, but feel free to add such an explanation if you have
 a better idea where to put it.)

 How about an example?  If we had examples spanning at least the
 trickier regexp productions, we could also add links from the grammar
 to examples for readers to see how these things work.

 The problem is not an example or an explanation, it's how to make
 people actually see it.  Maybe have links to examples for several of
 the entries in the top table.
