 That's really bad.
 
 I've committed and exp-tagged a corrected plt/src/mzscheme/port.c, and
 I'll re-release 102/11 binaries on cs shortly.
 
 [The problem is that the implementation didn't account for buffering on
 Unix file input ports, and the test suite didn't test input ports (only
 output ports).]
