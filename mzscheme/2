>Description:
	Here is the error I get: 

printf: expects type <pattern-string (tag ~I not allowed)> as 1st arg;
given "<li>Chapter a-number: <a href = TheB... (type <string>) 

	With display, I find out that the string I am trying to print is
<li>Chapter a-number: <a href = TheBook/06struct.ps>Defining Structures:
From Data Descriptions to Functions~III</a>> (load "html.ss") 

which is a perfectly legitimate tex string (The tilde is a hard blank, roughly.)

>How-To-Repeat:
	n/a
>Fix:

Use write or display instead of printf for unknown strings.

Matthias - I don't understand the context. Why are you passing an
unknown string as the first argument to printf? (This is a kind of
type error, where you have a value of type "string" and you're passing
it as an argument of type "format string".)

This belongs in the "mzscheme" category, right?
It should also be "closed" because it's not a bug (gnats even 
provides the special Class "mistaken" for PR's that are not
actual bugs).  Of course this is how printf works.

 I just wonder what happens if I reply to this message. I'm hoping that 
 the corresondance gets logged in the problem audit-trial.
