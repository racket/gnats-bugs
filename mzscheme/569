>Description:

setup-plt doesn't run. It just exits without setting anything up. I deleted
the projects and setup-plt, recompiled, re-ran mzscheme with the
appropriate flags (which worked) and then the new setup-plt still doesn't
work.

It was a cvs problem (bad exp tag). The correct code
works by avoiding GC allocation too early.
