>Description:
It appears the let-syntax (and other macro-facilities) have not been 
implemented? When I evaluate the following expression:

(let-syntax ((foo (syntax-rules ()
                                ((foo a) (display "5")))))
  (foo 3))

This is what is says: (and as you see, it's set to Full Scheme)

Welcome to DrScheme, version 101.
Language: Graphical Full Scheme (MrEd).
reference to undefined identifier: let-syntax
>How-To-Repeat:
just use let-syntax, define-syntax, or other macro-binders.

        implemented?
 
 That's correct.  From the MzScheme manual:
 
        MzScheme (pronounced ``Ms. Scheme'' or ``Miz Scheme'') is nearly 
        R5RS-compliant. MzScheme does not provide the define-syntax, 
        let-syntax, and letrec-syntax forms, although they are partially 
        supported by an external library.
