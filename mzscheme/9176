>Description:
(it appears that in the latest svn (version 3.99.0.10-svn31jan2008 [3m]) #(...) is not read as (vector ...).

The doc says:
#(1 apple 3) reads equal to (vector 1 'apple 3)
 
Either the doc is not not correct or #(...) is mistakenly read as an immutable vector.

Kind regards, Jos Koot
>How-To-Repeat:
(vector-set! #(1 2 3) 0 4) --> vector-set!: expects type <mutable vector> as 1st argument ...

(vector-set! (vector 1 2 3) 0 4) --> void

 Although
 
    (read (open-input-string "#(1 2 3)"))
 
 does produce an mutable vector, the expression
 
  '#(1 2 3)
 
 produces an immutable vector. That is, literal vectors are now
 immutable.
 
 I'll work on the docs.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
