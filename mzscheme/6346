    This is a result of support for module->namespace. I
    had convinced myself that it was cheape enough, but
    I musthave missed something.

 By changing the language modules "collects/setup/infotab.ss" and
 "collects/string-constant/string-constant-lang.ss", I removed most of
 the new memory consumption.
 
 In both of those language modules, `#%module-begin' expands to a use of
 `#%module-begin' from `mzscheme'. As a result, an "info.ss" or
 strng-constant module imports all of MzScheme into the compile-time
 environment, but without using any of it.
 
 So far so no problem, but the `require-for-syntax' of `mzscheme' is
 introduced by a macro. This makes the required names invisble in the
 "info.ss" or string-constant module. More importantly, it disables an
 "imports MzScheme in the usual way" optimization. The module's
 require-for-syntax table becomes huge --- bigger by a factor of 100.
 The large number of "info.ss" modules make the explosion particularly
 apparent. (This explosion always happened when the "info.ss" file was
 compiled, but the require-for-syntax table used to be discarded after
 the module was compiled.)
 
 The immediate solution is easy: I replaced `#%module-begin' with
 `#%plain-module-begin' in the two language modules.
 
 I'll look for ways to decrease the cost further.

 A "rename table easily reconstructed from definitions and imports"
 optimization (now exp-tagged) seems to have reduced the growth to
 negligible.
