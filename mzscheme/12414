>Description:
In the Racket reference manual section 9.2 the diagrams showing the format of "with-handlers" and "with-handlers*" functions don't have contracts style descriptions of the arguments. 

Also the arguments are called pred-expr and handler-expr.  As a new user of Racket it would be much clearer to me if in the documentation function arguments expecting  procedures would be called something like xxx-proc instead of xxx-expr (which as a new user implied to me that any expression was valid for the argument).

Another place in the documentation that this confused me was in the Racket Foreign Interface manual section 2. in the description of libffi keyword argument 	#:get-lib-dirs get-lib-dirs

Because I was new to Racket and didn't know the contracts syntax, it was a while before I realized that "get-lib-dirs : (-> (listof path?)) = get-lib-search-dirs" meant the argument should be a procedure that returns a list of paths.  If the argument was named "get-lib-dirs-proc" it would have been much clearer.  Also it wasn't clear that "= get-lib-search-dirs" was describing the default value if the keyword parameter was left out.

Thanks again
