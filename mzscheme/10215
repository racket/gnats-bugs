>Description:
This seems to be an inconsistent state of affairs:

> (map add1 (list) (list)) 
map: arity mismatch for add1: expects 1 argument, given 2

> (foldl add1 0 (list) (list))
0

Moreover, foldr and foldl don't even check that the proc argument is a procedure:

> (foldl 7 0 (list) (list))
0

This seems to violate the spec as given in the documentation:

"If foldl is called with n lists, then proc  must take n+1 arguments."
