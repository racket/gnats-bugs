>Description:
If I switch to certain language levels (I have had this problem with Beginning Student, Dracula/ACL2, and one of the DMDA languages), I get the following error.  It looks like this may have been triggered by Robby's fix for PR 10219 relating to ->d, but I'm not certain.

procedure capability-value method: expects a different number of arguments, given 2: #<wrapper-object> drscheme:define-popup

>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme, switch to HtDP: Beginning Student.
>Fix:
My fix to PR 10219 was buggy. Fixed now
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation, but it was in the contract library, so got a lower-level mzscheme violation.

The type story is the same as in PR 10219.
