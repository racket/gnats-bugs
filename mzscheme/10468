Contrast this with (regexp-replace " +" "    " "") which works as it should.

 The \s shorthand is part of the pregexp syntax (Perl-compatible
 regular expressions), not the regular regexp syntax (Posix-style
 regular expressions).  You need to either use an explicit character
 set in place of \s to keep using the normal regexps, or replace your
 pattern string with a Perl-compatible regular expression using the
 pregexp function or the #px syntax.  See the documentation on regular
 expressions and regular expression syntax for more information:

 Ahhh... I didn't read carefully enough. Sorry about that.
