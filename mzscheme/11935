>Description:
I'm seeing a DrRacket-specific compile-time error when trying to compile the following snippet of code.  The error I'm seeing is:

    module-path-index-resolve: "self" index has no resolution: #<module-path-index>

This only occurs if I'm running in DrRacket, under base language settings.  The Debugging dynamic property must be enabled for the bug to manifest.



The situation is adapted from an issue I'm seeing with my version-case package.  Given two files t.rkt and helper.rkt with the following content:


;; helper.rkt
#lang racket/base
(require (for-syntax racket/base))

(provide test)
(define-syntax (test stx)
  (syntax-case stx (else)
    [(_ [t b ...] ... [else e ...])
     (with-syntax ([transformer (syntax/loc stx
                                  (lambda (stx*)
                                    (cond 
                                      [t
                                       (syntax-local-introduce
                                        (quote-syntax (begin b ...)))]
                                      ...
                                      [else
                                       (syntax-local-introduce
                                        (quote-syntax (begin e ...)))])))])
       (case (syntax-local-context)
         [(expression)
          (syntax/loc stx
            (let-syntax ([name transformer])
              (name)))]
         [else
          (syntax/loc stx
            (begin
              (define-syntax name transformer)
              (name)))]))]))


;; t.rkt
#lang racket/base
(require "helper.rkt"
         (for-syntax racket/base))
(test
  [(string=? (version) "5.1.1")
   (displayln "ok")]
  [else
   (displayln "uh oh")])



when I try to run t.rkt directly in DrRacket, I see the module-path-index-resolve error.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 02 Aug 2011 19:20:28 -0400
Reason>>> This bug was related to syntax certificates. Getting
rid of certificates also got rid of the bug.
