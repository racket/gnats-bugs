>Description:
I am trying to convert documents from any of a bunch of different encodings to UTF-8 to use as training data. I installed the whole shebang from plt-scheme.org and things work fine from the default encoding to UTF-8, but I can't convert from any other encodings, including ASCII.  I checked to see that iconv.dll was in my lib directory and in the same directory as libmzschVERSION.dll, it was.  In fact, here's the contents of the directory, which has not been modified since installation.

UnicoWS.dll  libeay32.dll        libmzsch352_000.dll  myssink.dll
gcc          libmred352_000.dll  msvc                 ssleay32.dll
iconv.dll    libmzgc352_000.dll  myspage.dll

One person on the mailing list with access to visual studio said that when he attached to the DrScheme process via the VS debugger
" ... the module browser puts a little explanation(sic) mark next to "icon.dll", and it offers the note "The module did not load at the default address." "
>How-To-Repeat:
Open DrScheme

 I've checked this on Mac OS X and on Linux and they all worked fine, so 
 I can confirm that this is a Windows specific bug.
