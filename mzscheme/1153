Reason>>> It only took a little more than 7 years... DrScheme 370
now has a "Limit Memory..." option that lets you set a
memory limit on the program that DrScheme runs.

This is hopefully not the final answer. For one
thing, there's no limit by default, because there
doesn't seem to be a default that will work for everyone.
We would like to have DrScheme instead suspend a program
if it reaches a certain memory limit, and give the user the
option of continuing (with a higher limit) or terminating the
program. That imporvement requires a bit more support from
our run-time system, though.
