>Description:
I'm compiling racket with this options:
--enable-shared --enable-libffi --enable-gracket --enable-jit --enable-foreign --enable-places --enable-float --enable-docs --enable-pthread --enable-lt=/usr/bin/libtool --disable-futures

The compiler is gcc 4.6.

With the same options, racket 5.2.1 compiles without problems. I've tried racket 5.3 and 5.3.17, both versions fails with the same error:

raco setup: running: preprocessor/scribblings/preprocessor.scrbl

 Sorry for the delay, I've been doing a lot of testing with different
 options. This bug only occur when racket is compiled by a normal user,
 root doesn't have this problem.
 
 The culprits are the default limits of OpenBSD. With "ulimit -s
 8192" (the default is 4096) racket compiles without problems the file
 scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl.
 
 You can close the bug. Thanks.
