 I installed Netscape 6.2.3 on Windows 2000, and the teachpack worked.
 
 How did you get IE6 to be the default browser, and then switch back to
 Netscape?

 Well, I did get DrScheme to crash after trying something like this
 sequence.  But it was hard to make it happen.
 
 After that crash, Netscape would not work with the servlet any more.  I
 kept on getting error messages about `shell-execute' not working.  Did
 you get that error message?
 
 I suspect that the bug is some interaction between the Netscape
 configuration files and the underlying Win32 ShellExecute function.
 That is, I think it's the Win32 call that takes down DrScheme, not a bug
 in DrScheme itself.
 
 I'd guess that uninstalling and reinstalling Netscape might help.
