>Description:
Take the program

(define x 3)
(define y 2)
(define z 1)

and compile it to .zo.  Then mutilate and truncate the .zo file
at various points and see the messages.  They look like

  bad #` contents: 249 at 795
  bad count: 8 != 11

These aren't very helpful messages, and in particular they don't tell
a user where they might be coming from.  They should at least be
prefixed with something like "Error loading file foo.zo: ...".

 I was under the impression that .zo truncation can actually crash
 mred/mzscheme, so, while it might be nice to make better error messages, a
 truncated .zo file is quite dangerous.
 
 Is that true?

 Yes --- .zo files are unsafe.
 
 It is on my super-long-term list to look at making .zo files safe. I
 would certainly prefer that they were. At the same time, I don't plan
 to make them safe if there is a significant load-time cost.

    Remarkably enough, .zo files eventually became safe, and
    the error message reports the file name. And it only took
    five years (then another year or so to close the PR).
