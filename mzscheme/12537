>Description:
I managed to get a pretty complicated syntax/parse based macro to give this error:

sw/plt/collects/syntax/parse/private/runtime-progress.rkt:117:0: ps-difference: '(stx 2) is not an extension of '(stx 2)

What should have happened was something along the lines of an error via `#:fail-when`.
