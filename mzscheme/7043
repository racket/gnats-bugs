>Description:
I can't create syntax for a list of vector literals using
nested ellipses. DrScheme gives the following error:

syntax: no pattern variables before ellipses in template in: ...
(Highlighting the second ellipsis in the template)
>How-To-Repeat:
This code causes the error described above:

(with-syntax ([((n ...) ...) '((1 2 3) (4 5))])
  #'(quote (#(n ...) ...)))

However, deleting the inner # causes the code to 
produce a list of two lists of numbers.
