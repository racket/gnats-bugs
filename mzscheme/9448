>Description:
The program below prints the entire mutable cons list on a single line, but it should be broken up.

If I replace mcons with cons, it prints properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require scheme/pretty)
(define (f n)
  (cond 
    [(zero? n) (list)]
    [else (mcons n (f (- n 1)))]))
(parameterize ([pretty-print-columns 80])
  (pretty-print (f 200)))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "clements" by clements at Sun, 13 Sep 2009 18:01:47 -0400
Reason>>> I noticed it was fixed

State changed from "open" to "closed" by clements at Sun, 13 Sep 2009 18:01:47 -0400
Reason>>> bug no longer in evidence in recent versions of DrScheme.  Presumably, 
Matthew fixed it.
