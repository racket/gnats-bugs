>Description:
In "12.6.13 Reading Characters" the documentation says that:

"#\x‹digit16›{1,2}: Unicode for the hexadecimal number specified by ‹digit16›{1,2}, as in string escapes."

If I do this I either get two values (if the digit16 is all base 10 digits) or I get an error about an undefined reference.

 Indeed, the reader doesn't support #\x followed by hexadecimal digits
 --- only #\u or #\U followed by hex digits. The doc error seems to have
 been introduced when I rewrote the documentation for v4.0.
 
 Or maybe my intent was to change the implementation to make character
 reading more consistent with string reading. Although changing the
 implementation risks some compatibility problems, we're planning to
 change the reader in a similarly small way to require `#f' and `#t' to
 be followed by a delimiter. If we want to make the reader more
 consistent, maybe we should make the backward-incompatible changes at
 the same time.
 
 Does anyone have an opinion on whether to change the docs or
 implementation?
