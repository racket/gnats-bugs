 This sounds familiar, but I can't reproduce the problem. You have the
 latest docs?
 
 Thanks,

 After I submitted the bug report, I downloaded the latest docs
 to test this conjecture ... but I was surprised by a visitor
 and spent the day on other things instead. Sorry. No access to 
 my home machine. 
 
 Even if someone doesn't have the latest docs, I can't see how 
 this should happen. We should either get a consitent answer within
 say v17 docs rather than v18 docs or we should get an "out of sync"
 error.

 I think it's just a bug in old docs that I've already fixed.
