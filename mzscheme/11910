If I run

https://github.com/jeapostrophe/exp/blob/master/temporal-ctcs/tests/temp-c/dr-err.rkt

https://github.com/jeapostrophe/exp/blob/master/temporal-ctcs/tests/temp-c/dr-err-help.rkt

in DrRacket it says:

module-path-index-resolve: "self" index has no resolution: #<module-path-index>

But on the command-line it runs fine:

% racket -t dr-err.rkt 
1

I'm not sure whose problem this is: Ryan? Matthew? Robby? me?

 I have experienced the same bug, running code I wrote for my class
 this semester.
 
 Turning off debugging and/or DrRacket pre-compilation fixes the
 problem, in my experience, which makes me think that it's either
 Matthew or Robby.

 And it turns out that racket/load was a red-herring because
 
 https://github.com/jeapostrophe/exp/blob/master/temporal-ctcs/tests/temp-c/ex-matthias-b.rkt
 
 breaks too. (Although it is an un-reduced test case.)

 My best guess is that it's an errortrace bug or a macro expander bug 
 that errortrace triggers.
 
 See also PR 11363 and PR 10780.

 I'm pretty sure the bug is related to certificate handling in the macro
 expander. I keep putting it off because I expect to overhaul the
 certificate system any day now.
