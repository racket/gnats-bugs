>Description:
Pasting a multi-line expression into the Racket command-line REPL
overwrites the first character of the last line with 'R'. Also occurs
when pasting a multi-line expression into a REPL executable created
with raco exe, except then the character is the first letter
of the module name. E.g. test.rkt->test.exe overwrites with 't'.

Link to my users@racket-lang.org post on the topic, with other
examples: 
http://www.mail-archive.com/users@racket-lang.org/msg01737.html

The problem does not occur in DrRacket or GRacket, nor in Racket for
Mac OSX or Linux. It seems confined to the command-line REPL for
Windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open racket.exe in Windows. Open a text editor and enter the following three lines:
'(11 22 33
44 55
66 77)

Now copy those lines to the clipboard and paste them into the racket command line (rclick title bar, Edit->Paste).

Racket will return with:
'(11 22 33 44 55 R6 77)
