>Description:
When using `current-memory-use' with #f I get:

  current-memory-use: expects argument of type <custodian or memory-trace-function>; given #f

This is not according to the docs.  Also, I don't see anything
similar to a "memory trace function", so it might be something
in the implementation that should not show up.
