 This looks very very similar to an error I experienced recently.  
 Matthew fixed this bug, and I believe the change is now exp-tagged.  
 Your cvs date of 11jun suggests to me that this problem might go away 
 if you updated your sources.
 
 Just a thought,
 
 john

 Okay, I updated but now make won't run. I'll try to configure again ...
