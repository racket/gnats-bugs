>Description:
Search for `make-mime-error' in the documentation.  You'll get one result, which says:

make-mime-error  provided from net/mime

However, this is a lie, and `make-mime-error' is not provided by `net/mime' (or by anything else).  Further, if you click the link, you a documentation for the `mime-error' struct, with no indication that the constructor is not provided.

 Is this still the case?  I just tried:
 
     #lang racket
     (require net/mime)
     make-mime-error
 
 and got the value of the expected export.
