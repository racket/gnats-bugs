>Description:
Under Windows 2000, the program
http://chris.thil.de/tmp/springer_alle.scm
causes the System to reboot (without any notice).

Under Linux, I get a "Speicherzugriffsfehler", translated Memory access error and/or a kernel oops.

Both errors appear after a random running time.

Tried both DrScheme and MzScheme.
To run the Scheme code, you must set the language to Text/MzScheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the program, and wait until it crashes.
