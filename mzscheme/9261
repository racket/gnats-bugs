>Description:
Hi, I'd like to request that, for R6RS libraries, MzScheme support the *.mzscheme.{ss,sls,scm} filename extensions, in addition to *.{ss,sls,scm}.  The purpose is to have portable and automatic selection of libraries which use implementation-specific features; i.e. MzScheme will recognize foo.mzscheme.sls but not foo.ikarus.sls.  It is already supported by Ikarus, and Larceny is planning to support it.  

See:

http://groups.google.com/group/ikarus-users/browse_thread/thread/c0dcd1a7da292946/56df6ce71df593f4#56df6ce71df593f4

http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/larceny-trac/ticket/517

I already have a number of R6RS libraries using *.sls, but currently mzscheme does not recognize this extension nor *.scm.  And, I'd like to be able to make *.mzscheme.sls versions of the compatability libraries I already have for other implementations.

Thanks.
