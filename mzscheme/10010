 That is the correct response, as far as I can tell. You violated the contract.

 Yes, indeed I did.  The error message isn't so helpful in figuring out
 how, though, but that isn't redex's fault.

 Did you read the docs for or/c? (I've just now checked in something
 that improves them a little bit.)

 That wasn't what I meant - it's just not at all clear what function is
 involved, and which contract.  Perhaps the error message should
 include the same information as in a contract error message?

 Oh, I see. I hadn't thought of this as a contract violation in the
 past, but instead a malformed or/c contract.
 
 But perhaps that was wrong of me. Clearly it is in this case. I've
 changed it to be a contract violation.
