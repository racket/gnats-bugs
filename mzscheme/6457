>Description:
When calling sqrt with complex arguments we
obtain an incorrect value that include +inf.0
We "solve" the problem using expt.
Thank you very much (DrScheme is great!!!,
congratulations :)
>How-To-Repeat:
(sqrt 1+3e-10i) 
; => +inf.0+0.0i
; the correct answer is obtained (fortunately)
; with the expt function
(expt 1+3e-10i 1/2) 
; => 1.0+1.5e-010i
