>Description:
When trying to use 'compose' on a struct constructor which was exported from a module and on which a contract was defined, I get an error.

Workaround: remove the contract
>How-To-Repeat:
;; in Racket REPL

(module foo racket 
  (struct point (x y) #:transparent) 
  (provide/contract (struct point ((x real?) (y real?)))))

(require 'foo)

((compose point values) 1 2)

;; gives error: call-with-values: expected argument of type <procedure>; given #<procedure:point>
