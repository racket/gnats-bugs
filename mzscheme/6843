>Description:
Extensions fail to load on NetBSD, giving error messages like

   Undefined symbol "scheme_make_string"

To fix this problem, the mzscheme binary has to be linked with -rdynamic (using --enable-dynlib with configure does also work).

In addition, there's a bug in mzscheme/sconfig.h, it must not define UNDERSCORE_DYNLOAD_SYMBOL_PREFIX.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Sun, 02 May 2004 12:44:29 -0400
Reason>>> mzscheme


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:46 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
