The installer fails during the installaion of DrScheme 301 on OS X (10.2.8).  I opened the log and found the following:

I looked the errors up on the internet and found the following post most promising: http://www.mymac.ws/mac-compiling-on-10-4-tiger-for-10-2-jaguar-16680.html

With this in mind I downloaded an older version, 209, and installed it successfully.

If you suspect that this is a problem of building on a newer version of OS X, and you think you have a fix, I'd be happy to test it.  My email is casey.boardman@gmail.com.

 Judging from the url in the PR, the problem is the setup on the machine
 we use for the mac os x builds, no?

 You can try building from source, but if I remember correctly,
 something prevents MzScheme from even building on 10.2. (I think it had
 to do with Unicode-related support in C libraries.)
 
 If you try building and run into problems, I'd be happy to help work
 around them.
