>Description:
The documentation for resolve-module-path-index says that the output has to be a path.  However, when given a module path pointing to #%kernel, it does not return a path.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (require syntax/modresolve)

> (resolve-module-path-index (module-path-index-join ''#%kernel #f) #f)   
'#%kernel
