 You will probably hear this from many people, but two dots in a syntax
 list like that means move the thing between the dots to the beginning
 of the list. Eg:
 
  > (equal? '(a . b . c) '(b a c))
  #t
 
 Since this transformation happens at read time, what you wrote below is
 equivalent to:
 
    ((lambda (b a c) ...) 1 2 3)
 
 (as you might guess from your output)

 Hmmm, well, the idea of having infix notation apply to an argument
 list seems to be kind of far-fetched to me. And then, I would expect
 something like ((lambda (a . b . c . d) d) 1 2 3 4) to work...
 Oh well...

 We had a fairly long discussion about this on plt-design before moving
 to NEU. Do you recall?
 
 What meaning would you ascribe to the three dot version?

 Yes. It just hadn't sank in my mind that it would apply to argument
 lists too... It was rather unexpected, that's all.
 
 >What meaning would you ascribe to the three dot version?
 
 To give the same result as ((lambda (b a c . d) d) 1 2 3 4)
