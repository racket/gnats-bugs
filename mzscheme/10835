>Description:
Issuing the command

../configure --enable-mac64 --disable-mred --enable-sgc

on my MacBook Pro (core2, 10.6.2) results in "make && make install" failing by not finding some GC_pthread_* functions:

make mzschemecgc 
mkdir -p  PLT_MzScheme.framework/Versions/4.2.5.4
gcc -o PLT_MzScheme.framework/Versions/4.2.5.4/PLT_MzScheme  -pthread -framework CoreFoundation -dynamiclib -all_load  libmzscheme.a libmzgc.a -ldl -lm  -liconv 
Undefined symbols:

      _mz_proc_thread_wait in libmzscheme.a(mzrt.o)
  "_GC_pthread_detach", referenced from:

ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[4]: *** [PLT_MzScheme.framework/Versions/4.2.5.4/PLT_MzScheme] Error 1
make[3]: *** [cgc] Error 2
make[2]: *** [3m] Error 2
make[1]: *** [3m] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Perhaps it's still trying to build the Boehm GC, even though I have typed --enable-sgc?

 You can remove
 
   --enable-sgc
 
 because we upgraded the Boehm GC a while back, and it work fine for
 64-bit Mac OS X.
 
 
 Making --enable-sgc disable futures (for cgc) is on my todo list.

Reason>>> fixed configuration to auto-disable future for SGC build
 (a while ago)
