>Description:
There is something strange that I've encountered.  I used to open files (specified when running as a script) with a `with-input-from-file', but for some reason this seemed to fill up the memory.  Then I switched to openning and closing the file myself and it worked better but still crashed.  Finally I resorted to an explicit `collect-garbage' call and it looks like now it works fine with as many files as I want.  In any case, it should definitely not crash with a segmentation fault...  (I later found that this happens in an irregular way so I can't reproduce reliably now but it does happen after some good amount of files when I comment out the close-port and
GC...)

The thing is that for some time it crashed when run on 6 files (that's when I switch to explicit closing and gc), but now if I remvove the gc and explicit close-input-port, it crashes only after running on about 300 files (when I run the script with all my files on the command line).

Just add a comment that if it isn't reproducible by anyone, then I can open an account on my laptop to allow connecting to it remotely and testing it there (it has enough free space, ram, and loads of useful junk installed).
