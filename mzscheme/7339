open-output-file: cannot open output file: "H:\_LOCKplt-prefs.ss" (The network path was not found.; errno=53)

I dont know why it wants to access my H:\ drive, which is a drive that gets connected only when I'm logged into a domain with my box. Why would it not use a standard install directory? I can't run the application and it every time it opens I get the same message

 If you set the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables, DrScheme
 will put the preferences file in the indicated place.
 
 Version 299.100 put preferences in the current user's profile directory
 (which has become far more standard).
