>Description:
When I tried a clean build of PLT this morning, I discovered that "make install" fails right after the bootstrapping setup-plt stage (final lines of the output included below):

ln -s Versions/3.99.0.3_3m/Resources /Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/lib/PLT_MrEd.framework/
make install-common-middle
make no-run
cd .
make install-mred-post-collects
cd mred; make install-post-collects
make install-wx_mac-post-collects
cd ..; rm -rf /Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/collects/launcher/Starter.app
mkdir -p /Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/collects/launcher
cd ..; cp -r mred/Starter.app /Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/collects/launcher/.
make lib-finish
echo "/Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/lib"
/Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/lib
mzscheme/mzscheme3m -X "/Users/farr/Documents/code/plt/collects" -l setup
compile: identifier used out of context in: sc504
make[1]: *** [install-3m] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 2

The number in scXXXXX changes each time I run the code.  I'm assuming that this is an s(yntax)-c(ase) problem, but it's odd, because the "make" step passes with flying colors.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Update to today's SVN version on my G4 running OS X 10.4.11
2. Change directory to the base directory.
3. mkdir build && cd build && ../src/configure CFLAGS="-O3 -mcpu=7450 -mtune=7450" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mcpu=7450 -mtune=7450" && make && make install

The install will fail with the message given above.

 Thanks for the report. I think we must have some bug that is exposed by
 big-endianness, but I haven't been able to reproduce it on my own PPC
 machine. Every extra bit of information helps.

 I think I've finally figured this one out (thanks to a test case that
 consistently failed on Sparc Solaris).
 
 The problem was in "syntax.c", in the function that's called to
 evaluate the transformer RHSs of `letrec-syntaxes+values':
 
  void scheme_bind_syntaxes(...)
  {
    ...
    /* First expand for expansion-observation */
    {
      scheme_init_expand_recs(rec, drec, &mrec, 1);
      SCHEME_EXPAND_OBSERVE_PHASE_UP(mrec.observer);
      a = scheme_expand_expr_lift_to_let(a, eenv, &mrec, 0);
    }
    ...
  }
 
 The problem is that scheme_bind_syntaxes() is called when the enclosing
 expression might be in compile mode, instead of expand mode. If it's in
 compile mode, then `rec[drec]' as passed to the function doesn't have
 any particular value in it's `depth' field, which means that
 `mrec.depth' is initalized to a random value. If the value turns out to
 be a small positive number, then the `a' expression isn't fully
 expanded, which leads to the sort of things that go wrong when you use
 `expand-once'.
 
 The solution is to not perform the above expansion when in compile
 mode, since it's only there for the macro stepper (right, Ryan?).
 
 I've committed that change in SVN.

 Ouch. Mea culpa :(

 Yes.

 That fixed the build for me.

 Current SVN is working for me, too.  Thanks for the quick fix!
