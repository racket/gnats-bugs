>Description:
When an atexit closer is called in a MzScheme extension under
Win2K, a NULL pointer dereference occurs.
>How-To-Repeat:
The program:

#include "escheme

void closer(Scheme_Object *obj,

            Scheme_Close_Custodian_Client *fun,void *data) {
  // a "return" here before any work is done gets rid of the crash
  puts("closing");

}



Scheme_Object *scheme_initialize(Scheme_Env *env) {

  scheme_add_atexit_closer(closer);

  return scheme_make_string("hello world");

}



Scheme_Object *scheme_reload(Scheme_Env *env) {

  return scheme_initialize(env);

}

Compile this into a .dll.  In MzScheme 199.21, run:

  (load-extension "myext.dll")
  (exit)
  ** boom **

 I think the problem is that stdout is already closed by one of the
 other closers (hence the null dereference).

 OK, I replaced the puts() by a Windows MessageBox() call.  No crash this
 time, but the message box comes up about 4 or 5 times when I call
 (exit).  Is that expected?

 Yes. The closer is called on every object still registered with the
 custodian.

 To answer my own question: yes, it is expected.
