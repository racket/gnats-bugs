#15(a a a b b b c c c d d d e)

The actual value is completely correct, but if the last element
of a vector is repeated, it's only printed once. If this is the intention, I think there should be some indication at the end of the vector that something is being elided. E.g.,

#15(a a a b b b c c c d d d e ...)

The initial length is, technically, sufficient to disambiguate. But for a vector of even moderate length, it isn't easy to eyeball. 
>How-To-Repeat:
> #(a a a)
#3(a)

Seems to be independent of language.

 This is indeed intended. The most useful case is for printing cases
 like (make-vector 1000).

 Thanks for the report,

Reason>>> replying

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Fri, 09 May 2008 15:04:03 -0400
Reason>>> Like Jens said, there is no bug, but this was confusing
others too, and in v4 the default output does not do this.
