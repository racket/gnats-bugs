>Description:
The MrEd docs state that make-object of font% can take 1, 5 or 6 arguments. It looks like it can actually take 1, 4 or 5 arguments. The case with 5 is right in the documentation, while the case with 4 looks like (size, family, style, weight).

 I see 0 (first case), 4 or 5 (second case), or 5 or 6 (third case).

 The case you report for 4 is like 5 but with a default for the last
 argument, right?
 
 I think the docs are right (for a change), but if you can send me
 example code to demonstrate the bugs, I'd appreciate it.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
