>Description:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/dicts.html#(def._((lib._racket/dict..rkt)._dict-map)) shows make-custom-hash as taking three required arguments.  But in fact, it takes two require arguments, and one optional argument.  The example only uses the two required arguments, which is how I noticed.

Also, the docs don't clearly spell out the purpose of that optional argument: what's hash2-proc for, anyway?
