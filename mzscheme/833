The base binary produces a segmentation fault whenever it's run:

Welcome to MzScheme version 53, Copyright (c) 1995-98 PLT (Matthew Flatt)
Segmentation Fault

Naturally, as a result, I cannot create .zo's with install. 
(install does not check for this, and gives me a successful
completion message.)
Similarly, I can't run setup-plt either.

asia has the same specs (except the hardware is a Sparc 10) but of
course MzScheme runs fine there.  I FTPed to CS and downloaded the
binary from CS, but that made no difference.

 It probably has something to do with the alignment of the stack which
 upsets the GC.  I recompiled MzScheme 53 using the more reliable
 HEURISTIC2 instead of HEURISTIC1 for the GC (which is the same fix for
 running Solaris 2.7 and is already installed in MzScheme 100), but I
 can't log in to test it. Try ~mflatt/mzscheme.

It wasn't the stack trace. It was mmap() and teh use of the MAP_FIXED
flag.
