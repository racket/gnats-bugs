MzScheme, version 103.
do form in define-syntax:
do variable not bound in step of another do variable.
From R5RS I understand that it should be bound.
See steps-to-reproduce.

>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "synrule.ss")

(define-syntax for ; simplified for
 (syntax-rules ()  ; your convenience
  ((for) (do ((i 1
               (add1 i))     ; <-- here i is bound
              (r 1
               (+ r i)))     ; <-- here i is not bound,
             ((> i 3) r))))) ; though I think it should
(for)

Results:
Welcome to DrScheme, version 103.
Language: Textual Full Scheme (MzScheme).

 Thanks for the bug report. This has been fixed for the next release,
 where `define-syntax' and `syntax-rules' are built into core MzScheme.

 Hi,
 Thanks for reply. Allow me two simple questions.
 Will 104 include let-syntax?
 Do you have any indication as when 104 will be released?
 (I cant use the preliminary source, because I have no C at hand on my pc.)
 I find Dr and Mz Scheme great because:
 1 it implements Scheme very well (as far as I can judge)
 2 it downloads without apparent dependency on other stuff
 3 it provides a nice environment
 4 it is very well documented and supported
 Regards, Jos

 Quoting "Jacob J. A. Koot":
 > Will 104 include let-syntax?
 
 Yes. Version 200 (the changes are radical enough to warrant a major
 increment to the version number) will be fully R5RS-compiliant,
 including support for `let-syntax' and `letrec-syntax'.
 
 > Do you have any indication as when 104 will be released?
 
 Early summer.
