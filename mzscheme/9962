>Description:
The documentation for syntax/boundmap is based on the old hash table bindings, like hash-table-get, which have been replaced with new bindings such as hash-ref.

The module-identifier-mapping bindings are now, I believe, equivalent to bound-identifier-mapping, but are listed as equivalent to module-identifier-mapping (i.e. themselves).

The bound-identifier-mapping-get function lists any/c as the contract for failure-thunk, like hash-ref, but the implementation raises a contract error for non-thunk values.  The same error probably exists for free- and module-identifier-mapping-get.
