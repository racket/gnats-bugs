 Lo, on Tuesday, January 13, bugs@plt-scheme.org did write:

 Rather than attaching a tar file, I've put it on the web:
 
 <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/namespace-bug.tgz>
 
 Six files:
     * environment.ss -- irrelevant; required as import to clinger.ss
     * clinger.ss -- module from which we try to extract non-provided
       identifier.
     * foo.ss -- module which attempts to extract non-provided identifier
       from clinger.ss.
     * ast.ss -- irrelevant; required by program.ss
     * program.ss -- module from which we try to extract non-provided
       identifier.
     * bar.ss -- module which attempts to extract non-provided identifier
       from program.ss.
 
 If you load foo.ss and execute it in the module language, you'll get the
 error described in the original bug report.  If you load and execute
 bar, however, everything behaves as expected.

 Thanks for the code, without which I had little hope of understanding
 the problem. I've exp-tagged a bug fix.
 
 Details:
 
 The problem has to do with the way modules are compiled and then
 loaded, and the way that identifier-mapping works for
 module->namespacve. Roughly, the process is
 
   compile module:
     generate id mapping while processing module imports and defns
     ...
     if the imports and defns are simple enough, forget the mapping
 
   load module:
     load the code, which often involves adjusting the module name
     according to the load context
 
   mod->ns:
     if the compile-time mapping was remembered, use it
     otherwise re-generate the mapping
 
 The problem was that the module names inside a remembered mapping
 weren't adjusted at load time. Most modules, like "program.ss", are
 simple enough that the mapping is regenerated (using the adjusted
 module name), but "clinger.ss" is not simple.
 
 The solution is to adjust the module name within a remembered mapping
 in the load phase.
