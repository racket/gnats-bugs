This report supersedes #14927, which became rather convoluted.

Junctions allow to create directory symbolic links. See the Sysinternals info here for more info: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx.

Example:

"C:\doc" points to "C:\Users\MyUser\My Documents"

Racket crashes when trying to access files whose path contains a junction. Loading or saving (even an empty file) causes the crash (i.e., to/from "C:\doc" in this example).

Preliminary debugging showed that in [...]\racket\racket\src\racket\src\file.c, do_expand_filename(...), as called from do_simplify_path(...), returns a null pointer, which subsequently leads to a crash.
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrRacket, open a file in a 'junction'ed directory or try to save a file there.

Alternatively, try to build Racket from a directory which is a junction. Crash will occur on setup step.

  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/f30b3a50fd
  | Windows: fix problems with junctions and symlinks
  | 
  | Racket wasn't reparsing correctly; the strategy worked ok
  | for links created by `mklink`, but not with other tools that
  | leave the "printed name" field blank.
  | 
  | A consequence of various fixes is that reparse points like
  | "My Documents" (in a typical configuration) correctly resolve
  | to actual paths like "Documents".
  | 
  | Finally, `directory-exists?` didn't handle root directories like
  | "C:/" correctly. The query would actually report properties of
  | the OS-level current working directory, and when junctions are
  | involved, the current directory can be a link instead of a directory.
  | 
  | Relevant to PR 14950 and PR 14912

 Thanks very much for tracking down this problem! Does the latest
 snapshot work on your machine?:
 
   http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/
 
 
 Thanks also for the pointer to the `junction` tool. I was using
 `mklink`, which it turns out includes optional information in the
 junction; `racket` was relying on that optional information, instead of
 the right information within a junction.

 Yes, the current snapshot does solve the problem.
 
 Cheers,
