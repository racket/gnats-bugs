>Description:
The expression below generates a bad error message, for two reasons:

  1) no source location
  2) override should say something about "not inside class" or something.

>How-To-Repeat:

  (require (lib "class.ss"))
  (class object%
    (define/override (get-one-line-summary) ""
    (define/override (use-namespace-require/copy?) #t)
    (super-instantiate ()))))
