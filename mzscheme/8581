 Can you elaborate a bit? `(find-system-path 'home-dir)' really is
 intended to call the security guard with #f as the path and '(exists)
 as the mode list, so I'm not sure why the above shouldn't raise an
 exception. But the `begin-for-syntax' hints that you have something
 else in mind, but I don't quite get it.

 Sorry -- I should have read the docs...  The thing is that I had this
 problem pop up in the handin server code -- I didn't read the docs, so
 I just minimized the problem to the above code, and didn't even think
 to try it without the `begin-for-syntax'...
 
 (I closed it.)
