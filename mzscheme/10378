 One of them is probably the print command that is inserted around each  
 body expression.

 But then it should always be visible, right?  That's why I tried
 
   #lang scheme
   (define (foo) (car 'foo))
   (foo)
 
 which shows it only once.  But that's probably due to the tail call,
 and I see it twice again if I make the second line (+ 1 (foo)).  Maybe
 there should be some "ignore me" syntax property for the printout
 expressions, since they're biting in more than one aspect (eg, the
 recent debugger issue)?
 
 Or maybe there's some other way to deal with the printout like doing
 it from the evaluation handler?  (In some way that will still make it
 configurable by the language.)
 
 (BTW, Robby: in all of these PRs I had the debugging turned on, which
 might be relevant to several.)

 Sounds like this one isn't my PR, then?

 I really need to turn back on the "computer language" information in
 the bug reports. I don't know when/why it went away (or I've
 forgotten...?)

 At least not for now -- if Matthew chooses to add some way to identify
 these expressions then DrScheme will need to use it.  This is why I
 think that maybe some other way to do it will be overall easier.

 Well, at least these options are very relevant now...
