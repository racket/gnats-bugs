State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 29 Aug 2007 23:10:00 -0400
Reason>>> When the bytecode optimizer converts a procedure that used to
refer to a "global" (i.e., something not primitive that is defined
at the to level or module top level) to something that no longer
refers to "global"s, then a flag wasn't properly reset in the optimized
copy. The bug is specific to letrec-style bindings where the optimization
happens on a second iteration (i.e., the first pass at optimization leaves
some reference to a global).
