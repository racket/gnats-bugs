>Description:
In Windows, if you've loaded an extension, DrScheme 
doesn't release it until its process terminates.

I think a call to FreeLibrary() will release the 
library.
>How-To-Repeat:
In DrScheme:

 (load-extension "foo.dll")
 clear defns window
 hit Execute a.k.a. Play
 try to recompiled foo.dll
 Windows says dll in use

 It will also likely crash MrEd/MzScheme, because the extension will
 have registered function pointers and static addresses.
 
 We'd have to set up a protocol for unloading extensions, which it would
 be fairly complicated to implement. Maybe sometime in the future.
