>Description:
The below program causes a seg fault.  Don't ask me what the expected behavior should be-- I was just trying to convert my yield sequence stuff to use prompt/control and it seg faulted, and I trimmed my program down to a minimal reproducing program.  I'm using a recent svn build (9039) on Ubuntu 7.10.

Reason>>> The bug was in the code to share stack copies in nested
continuations. The technique only applies when the two
continuations are in the same "meta-continuation", but
there was no check to make sure that's the case.
