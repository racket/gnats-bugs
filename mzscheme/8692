>Description:
Fedora 7 is now built on ppc64 too.
However the build fails during invocation of mzscheme3m with the following error:
make[4]: Entering directory `/builddir/build/BUILD/plt-370/src/mred/gc2'
../../mzscheme/mzscheme3m -qr "./gen-deps.ss"
Seg fault (internal error) at 0x4000c
The complete build log is available at:
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/getfile?taskID=14220&name=build.log
(I am the maintainer of the plt-scheme Fedora package)

 Thank you for the report!
 
 Unfortunately, I don't have any good guesses, and I don't have a ppc64
 machine at my disposal.
 
 Maybe the solution for now is to configure the ppc64 build with
 --enable-cgcdefault?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:57 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
