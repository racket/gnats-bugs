>Description:
'(3#| a comment|#) parses as a list containing one symbol, instead of as a list with a number and a comment.  

Actual: (|3# a comment#|)
Expected: (3)
>How-To-Repeat:
type in '(3#| a comment|#) at the mzscheme prompt

State-Changed-From-To: open->closed
State-Changed-By: eli
State-Changed-When: Fri Nov 14 16:58:26 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    Follows from `#' losing its special status if it doesn't follow a whitespace.  Allegro does the same thing.  scsh (and guile) do the same thing with `(3#!...!#)'.
    
    Should be reopened if anyone believes that #| should always open a comment (for some definition of always that doesn't include strings, backslashes etc).
