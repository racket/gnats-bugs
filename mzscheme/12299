>Description:
The interface for current-proxy-servers is currently

(current-proxy-servers mapping) â†’ void?
  mapping : (listof (list/c string? string? (integer-in 0 65535)))

This does not support the situation, which I think is common in proxy setups, where certain hosts (notably localhost and its synonyms) should not be proxied.  This could be catered for by an amended current-proxy-servers which had 

  mapping : (listof (or/c (list/c string? string? (integer-in 0 65535))
                          (list/c string? (->* (string?) (values string? (integer-in 0 65535)))))

The alternative function argument would take a hostname as argument, and return the proxy host and port, or #f #f if the host should not be proxied.

I think that would be able to cater for the important cases.  An alternative would be to define a no-proxy regexp somewhere, but I can't see a way of making that neat.
