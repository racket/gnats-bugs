>Description:
In the module language, using the r6rs language, the interactions
window won't accept literal bytevectors.  It just waits for more
and more input.  Any expression with a literal bytevector as a 
subexpression causes this behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the definitions window, using the module language:

#!r6rs
(import (rnrs))

In the interactions window, type:

#vu8(12 23 123)

Hit enter; it just wants more input and doesn't eval the literal.

 This is a known bug with any language that uses a custom reader in the
 Module language.  Currently, the Module language always uses the
 default s-expression reader for the interactions window.  We hope to
 fix this in the general case fairly soon.

 To clarify -- it's not really a bug in the sense that there is no code
 that is broken.  The `#lang' interface is close to being able to
 specify a repl expression reader (which is different than the
 whole-file language reader that `#lang' is based on), and once that's
 done, the various tools will be adjusted to use this.  (This includes
 not only the module language -- there's also the sandbox library and
 the mzscheme repl.)

 Understood.  Thanks -- feel free to close the report.
