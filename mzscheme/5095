 I'm confused.  Why aren't you writing
 
   (syntax-case (foo)
     [(_ foo) (syntax foo)])
 
 if you want FOO to be a literal?  (Your other message, to me, suggests
 this is what you want.  If not, perhaps you could be a touch more
 verbose in your error description?  As a general rule, it's always
 good to state what behavior you expect!)

 Sorry, the bug report is that the error message has a misspelling,
 that's all.
