>Description:
In the reference manual, section 4.2 Numbers:

1. "extract" should be "exact"
2. "The infinities +inf.0 and -inf.0 are integers, and they answer #t for both even? and odd?."  This is false: they answer #f for integer?, and raise exceptions for even? and odd?.
3. (section 4.2.5) atan "Returns the arctangent of z or of (make-rectangular x y)."  This is false: (atan x y) = (atan (/ x y)), or pi/2 if y=0, or raises an exception if x=0 and y=0.   [Shouldn't this accept two numbers, not just two reals?]
>How-To-Repeat:
