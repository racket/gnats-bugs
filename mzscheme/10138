>Description:
When I run the mzscheme tests by loading collects/tests/mzscheme/quiet.ss, after the tests complete and the mzscheme process exits, the terminal I used to run mzscheme no longer echoes keyboard input. The terminal still accepts the input; I can run still run commands from the shell, and the command's output is shown.

Only tried on linux terminals so far (gnome-terminal and xterm).

 I just tried exactly what you list below (since I usually start it
 with `mzscheme -r'), only with a -q flag to avoid loading my stuff
 (looks like readline gets in the way of some test somewhere), and
 things worked perfectly fine.

 I don't know exactly -- but IIRC there are several tests that require
 a "clean" environment.

 Aha! That must be it. I retried it with -q and the problem went away. 
 And my .mzschemerc does load readline. So why does readline have this 
 effect?

 The tests run by "quiet.ss" all ran without failure for me. The only 
 problem was the effect on the terminal.
 
 I also tried running "all.ss", and it did not have the terminal problem.

 If you look in "quiet.ss" you'll see that it doesn't do anything
 special: it captures the initial error port in a global variable, then
 it runs the tests with the `current-{output,error}-port's redirected
 to a /dev/null-like port, and using the original error port captured
 before to print errors.  It's a quick hack to make the tests silent,
 but it's not playing any games that should have any effect on the
 terminal.  The only possible thing that I can think of that might lead
 to such a state is if mzscheme dies in a way that makes readline leave
 the terminal in a bad state.  (But I didn't see this happen even when
 I ran it from a readline-enabled repl.)

 Are we in agreement that if it's repeatable it's a bug somewhere?  
 (not necessarily in mzscheme)
