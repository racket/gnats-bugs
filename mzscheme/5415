I have a succesfull compilation, except to instal the .zo files, after choosing [y] it give's "segmentation fault", but it ends with saying "PLT installation done".
When I run
$ bin/drscheme
it outputs prints "segmentation fault".
>How-To-Repeat:
- Install Redhad 7.3 (vanila installation with addition of development tools)
- download DrScheme at "http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/download.html"
$ cd /usr/src
$ gunzip plt.src.x.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf plt.src.x.tar
$ cd /plt/src
$ ./configure --enable-sgc
$ make
$ make install
$ cd ..
$ ./install
Create .zo files now (y/n)? [y] y
./install: line 151: 11179 Segmentation fault    bin/setup-plt
$ bin/drscheme
segmentation fault

 Hi,
 
 I haven't yet tried RH 7.3. Can you tell me what the default stack
 limit is? (DrScheme doesn't start in some Debian flavors because the OS
 reports a stack limit of 4GB, which confuses the end-of-stack
 calculation inside DrScheme.)
 
 Is upgrading to 200alpha12 a possibility for you? If the problem is the
 one I think it is, that would solve it. Otherwise, I can probably
 provide a patch to 103.
 
 Matthew
