>Description:
When I try to use the Stepper with the following program in Beginning Student level:

(require 2htdp/image)
(define (red-ring outer inner)
  (overlay
   (circle outer "solid" "red")
   (circle inner "solid" "white")))
(circle 5 "solid" "red")
(red-ring 10 5)

The first (circle ...) application works fine. But the second step of the (red-ring ...) evaluation gives this error in the Stepper:

find-highlight: couldn't find highlight-placeholder in expression: (list '#%plain-app 'overlay (list '#%plain-app 'circle (list 'quote 10) (list 'quote "solid") (list 'quote "red")) (list '#%plain-app 'circle (list 'quote 5) (list 'quote "solid") (list 'quote "white")))

This is DrRacket, version 5.0.0.1--2010-05-25(c9a7baa/a) downloaded from the pre-release installers page.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following in a "Beginning Student" source code file:

(require 2htdp/image)
(define (red-ring outer inner)
  (overlay
   (circle outer "solid" "red")
   (circle inner "solid" "white")))
(red-ring 10 5)

Press "Step" button. Click "Step >" twice.

Reason>>> fixed a JIT bug that John Clements worked hard to narrow down
