>Description:
The error message
  "module: No 'require' matching the module name"
might better be stated 
  "module: Can't 'provide' from a module that isn't 'require'd".

(Don't know if this same message is shown under
different circumstances where my phrasing is inappropriate,
though.)

>How-To-Repeat:
(module foo mzscheme
   (provide (all-from (lib "list.ss"))))

>Fix:
