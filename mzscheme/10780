>Description:
Running a.ss in drscheme produces the following error:
  module-path-index-resolve: "self" index has no resolution: #<module-path-index>

Calling `good' instead of `bad' doesn't raise the error.

Disabling debugging in drscheme also eliminates the error.

...good luck.

 Dan
>How-To-Repeat:
In a.ss:

#lang scheme

(require "b.ss")
(bad 0)

b.ss:

#lang scheme

(provide (all-defined-out))

(define-syntax bad
  (let ()
    (λ (x)
      #'0)))

(define-syntax good
  (λ (x)
    (let ()
      #'0)))

 And merging the code into one module also eliminates the error.

 And!=E2=80=94downgrading to 4.2.3 eliminates the error.
 
 I think that's everything I meant to include in the first place.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 27 Nov 2011 20:41:22 -0500
Reason>>> fixed in the conversion from syntax certificates to taints
