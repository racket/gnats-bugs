>Description:
The program below gives the following error:

contract-first-order-accessor: expects argument of type <struct or struct-type with property>; given #<predicate-contract>
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(define funny/c (or/c (and/c procedure? (-> any)) (listof (-> number?))))
(define/contract f (-> funny/c any) void)
>Fix:
Changed the first-order-prop accessor return the flat-prop property, if there is one, since there seem to be several flat contracts that do not have first-order-props (in the bottom of scheme/contract/private/guts.ss).
>Release-Note:
This was a contract error.

Probably this would have been a type error.
