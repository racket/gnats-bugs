 Thank you for the bug report. This bug has been fixed for the next
 release.
 
 The bug you reported is certainly the worst of the bunch, but I found a
 few other bugs: (acos 1) should return 0 instead of 0.0, (atan 0)
 should return 0 instead of 0.0, and (log 0) should signal an error
 rather than returning -inf.0.
