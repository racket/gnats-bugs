>Description:
The program below (in the Pretty Big language) runs correctly, but the commented-out line raises an error if run:

procedure application: expected a procedure that accepts keyword arguments, given #<procedure>; arguments were: #:key 1
>How-To-Repeat:
(module a scheme
  
  (define (f #:key k) k)
  
  (define (g x) (f #:key x))
  
  (provide/contract
   [f (unconstrained-domain-> any/c)]
   [g (unconstrained-domain-> any/c)]))

(module b scheme
  
  (require 'a)
  
  ;(f #:key 1)
  (g 1))

(require 'b)
>Fix:
unconstrained-domain-> wasn't updated for the new keyword system.
>Release-Note:
This was definitely a contract violation (of a lower level contract).

This was not a type error, as far as I can tell, altho there may have been one at the lower level in the same way that there was a contract violation with a sufficiently good type systems, altho it seems difficult to imagine.
