>Description:
I'm using pregexp-replace* and I need to specify a backslash in the insert string.  The docs here:
http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/371/html/mzlib/mzlib-Z-H-36.html#node_chap_36

say, "Use \\ in the insert string to specify a literal backslash."  However, when I do that, for example like this:
(pregexp-replace* "(f)" "defghi" "\\BEFORE\\1AFTER")
I get:
"defBEFOREfAFTERghi"
I expected:
"def\BEFOREfAFTERghi"

(I'm trying to replace every occurance in a string of a regexp special character with that character preceded by a backslash.)

 The problem is confusing layers of encoding. The string has to have to
 backslashes, but to write such a string as a literal, you need to
 escape each backslash with a backslash --- so you need 4 backslashes
 total.

 Try
  (pregexp-replace* "(f)" "defghi" "\\\\BEFORE\\1AFTER")

 I should have mentioned that I tried that.  Here's what happens:
 
 > (pregexp-replace* "(f)" "defghi" "\\\\BEFORE\\1AFTER")
 "de\\BEFOREfAFTERghi"
 
 I tried using \$ to split things up; I couldn't get that to work for me either.

 Are you worried about the double backslash in the output? Note that the
 first four characters of that result string are `d', `e', backslash,
 and `B'. The double backslash is, again, the encoding.
 
 Functions like `display' show the raw characters:
 
  > (pregexp-replace* "(f)" "defghi" "\\\\BEFORE\\1AFTER")
  de\BEFOREfAFTERghi

 Ah, yes. Sorry, I should have used display.  Thanks.
