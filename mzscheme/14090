>Description:
raco pkg install allowed me to install a package that had "racket" as a dependency. This package doesn't exist. Installation succeeded.

The next time I ran raco setup, it complained about the missing dependency.
    check-dependencies: package not installed: "racket"

The package system docs also recommend using "racket" as a dependency, which is problematic.

 Matthew, can you look at this?
 
 When we do dependency checking, we specifically special-case racket.
 But that special-case isn't respected in setup/private/pkg-deps.
 
 I think we don't need the special case anymore, because racket is
 package based so users should instead depend on "base" or "racket-lib"
 etc rather than the fake "racket" package.
 
 Do you agree?
 
 Jay
