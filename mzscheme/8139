>Description:
I have a module that is part of a collection. I've run setup-plt on the collection, and therefore have many tasty .zo files. For now, I'll say I have modules 'foo' and 'bar'.

(module foo mzscheme
  (require "bar.scm")
  (do-bar 8) 
)

(module bar mzscheme
  (provide (all-defined))
  (define (do-bar x) x))
>How-To-Repeat:
If I precompile the two modules given (using setup-plt, v350), and have both of them open in DrScheme, I can do the following:

1. Modify 'bar', changing the name of the provided function to 'do-bar-2'.

2. Change 'foo' to properly call the now renamed 'do-bar-2'.

3. Save both modules.

4. Check syntax in 'foo'. Or run it for that matter. 

In either case, I get an "expand: unbound variable in module in: do-bar-2" error. 

(To be fair, I'm simplifying my actual code.) However, if I re-run setup-plt on the collection, then everything works.

I will admit, this may just be a case of user-expectations being different than what the language actually provides. I assumed that if I modified a module in a collection, the modified, uncompiled module would be preferred over the precompiled .zo files. 

So my apologies if this isn't a bug. It certainly confused me, though. 

I've poked around the help desk, but it isn't clear from Ch16 of the PLT MzScheme manual whether .zo files are preferred, or modules are preferred, or... So. I'll submit it through the wizzy bug report form.

Cheers,
M
