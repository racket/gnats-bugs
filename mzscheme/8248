>Description:
The documentation for the ->* contract constructor is a little unclear.  It's not immediately obvious (to me, at least) what the semantics of the second argument are, in the three-argument form.  In particular, does the second argument represent the contract that each of the rest args must satisfy, or is it the contract for the list that contains all of the rest args?

In other words, let's say I have a function that takes at least one integer and returns a boolean.  Do I write its contract as
  (->* (integer?) integer? (boolean?))
or as
  (->* (integer?) (listof integer?) (boolean?))

Could you clarify that?

 I'm just checking the manual runs before checking in the clarification,
 but just in case you didn't already figure it out, you want the second
 one.
 
 Thanks,
