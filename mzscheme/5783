I downloaded

   mzscheme.src.unix.tar.gz

The first (minor) issue is that there is no obvious indication in the distribution's name, nor content, of what release this is.  Thus, I _think_ I'm reporting a bug against 202, but I can't say for sure.

The more major issue is that if I do this

   $ cd plt/src
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

mzscheme is only installed in the builddir (that is, plt/bin), not in any system wide location.  This despite the fact that './configure --help' claims the usual GNU setup, where --prefix defaults to /usr/local/ and so on.

I don't know if this behavior is intentional or not, so don't know whether to call this a build process bug, or a build process documentation bug :-).  I'm tempted to call it the former, since mzscheme does seem to be trying to conform to the usual GNU installation standards, according to which "./configure && make && make install" installs the software under /usr/local/.

Thanks in advance for your time,
-Karl

 Hi Karl,
 
   The build process is intentionally putting the binaries there. The
 way we have things set up, there is no difference between the build
 area and the release area. If you want to cleanup, you can "make clean"
 in the src directory (or even delete it entirely if you don't want the
 source anymore). The intention is that you put the "plt" directory
 whereever its final resting place should be, before you begin the build
 process. You should not need to supply paths to configure.

 When we create the configure script, we normally run something that
 cleans up the --help output to make it more accurate. But it appears
 that I've been upgraded to a newer version of `autoconf', and the
 clean-up process doesn't work on the new-style output. I'll fix that.
 
 We'll also try to make the configuration process even more standard. As
 Robby says, though, the way it works by default is indeed the intended
 behavior. To change the install directory, only --prefix is currently
 supported.

 Ah, okay, these explanations clear it all up for me.  Thanks very much
 for the prompt responses!
