Human Language: english
>Description:
In Beginning Language, doc for member says "...comparing values
with equal?...", but doc for equal? says "to determine whether two
lists are equal" (not two values). Also, doc for memv says that
values are compared with eqv?, but eqv? isn't defined in Beginning
(or the other teaching languages) at all.



>How-To-Repeat:
Help Desk
>Fix:
Larry, it is okay if one function refers to another, even 
if that function processes the same kind of data. 

added eqv to beginner, but it will not appear in htdo
