>Description:
The first program below produces an error but the second one doesn't.
They are basically the same program, however. Certainly their
behavior should be the same, AFAICT.
>How-To-Repeat:
This program:


(module sig mzscheme
  (provide m)
  
  (define-syntax (m stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_)
       (with-syntax ([ref (list* 'values 1 2 (list 3))]
		     [maker-name 1]
		     )
	 (syntax
	  ref))])))
(require sig)
(m)


produces an error, but this one doesn't:


(module sig mzscheme
  (provide m)
  
  (define-syntax (m stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_)
       (with-syntax ([ref (list* 'values 1 2 (list 3))]
		     ;[maker-name 1]
		     )
	 (syntax
	  ref))])))
(require sig)
(m)
