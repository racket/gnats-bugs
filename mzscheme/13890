>Description:
I cloned the pkg version of Racket from github into ~/experimental and built it there. When I copied ~/experimental/racket to /Applications/racket, the copy in /Applications kept giving an error message whenever I tried to use redex:

../../../Applications/racket/racket/lib/collects/errortrace/stacktrace.rkt:325:4: errortrace: unrecognized expression form: (quote-syntax (scheme/base scribble/manual (for-label framework) (only-in scribble/manual defproc*) (only-in scribble/manual defproc*) (only-in scribble/manual defproc*) (only-in scribble/manual defproc*) (only-in scribble/manual defproc*) (only-i...


source file contents:

#lang racket
(require redex)


I went back to working with the original copy while running `make' in /Applications/racket, but then the original copy started giving a similar error. The /Applications copy still gives the same error. Running `make' on the original copy again appears to have produced a working install, but I can't get the /Applications install working.
