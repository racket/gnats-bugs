>Description:
The Help Desk incorrectly identifies "equal?" as working
only on lists in the Beginning through Advanced Language
Levels.

The Help Desk gives a rather obtuse description of "equal?"
at the Pretty Big Language Level that doesn't explain why
the submitted example returns false.

"Two structure values are equal? if and only if they are instances of the same structure type, no fields are opaque, and the results of applying struct->vector to the structs are equal?. (Consequently, equal? testing for structures depends on the current inspector.)"


It is very unexpected that the submitted example returns
true at the Advanced Language Level, but false at the
Pretty Big Language Level.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define-struct foo (x))
(define one (make-foo 3))
(define two (make-foo 3))
(equal? one two)
