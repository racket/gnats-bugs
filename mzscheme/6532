>Description:
It would be nice to have a builtin copy-string! that works like:

  (define (copy-string! dst skip src . more)
    (apply peek-string-avail! dst skip-k (open-input-string src) more))

without the inherent string copying that happens with open-input-string.

Also, it would be nice if there was some dangerous open-input-string*
variant that does not copy its string.  (And always use that version for
immutable strings which are also copied now, AFAICT.)
