 This is a good example of why `call-as-atomic' is categorized as
 unsafe.
 
 In atomic mode, it's important that you not call any code that might
 need to synchronize with other threads. Printing to DrRacket's output
 port requires synchronizing with the GUI that displays the output
 characters, and so printing in atomic mode can deadlock the Racket
 process, which is what happens here.
 
 I'll try to improve the documentation to make more clear how
 `call-as-atomic' is unsafe and when it can be used successfully.
 Mostly, you should avoid trying to use atomic mode.
