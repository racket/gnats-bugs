>Description:
	Some unit/sig call certain things signatures that aren't signatures.
>How-To-Repeat:

This code:

(compound-unit/sig
  (import [I : mred:application-imports^])
  (link [core : mzlib:core^ ((reference-library-unit/sig "corer.ss"))]
	[mred : mred^ ((reference-library-unit/sig "link.ss" "mred")
		       core
		       l)]
	[l : all^ ((reference-unit/sig "link.ss") mred)])
  (export (open (l : mred:application^))))

produced this error message:

compound-unit/sig: 2nd linkage (l signature) for mred contains an extra
value name "transaction-amount" which is not required by mred unit's 2nd
import (application signature)

The actual problem with the compound-unit/sig is that the 3rd import to
mred (2nd linkage) has more names than the unit/sig expects. There doesn't
seem to be any signature named "l" anywhere, only link clauses named "l".
