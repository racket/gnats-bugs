>Description:
It should at least get `#:redirections', but it seems better to make it accept
anything and pass it on.  Below is a version that works, but I can't figure out
how to write the contract that says that whatever is passed to it gets passed
to the getter function.

But perhaps this is not needed anyway -- there's very little that it does in
any case.  An alternative would be to add

   (with-input-from port thunk)
   (call-with-input port consumer)

that call the thunk/consumer, and then close the port.  (And if they're added
then the corresponding output functions should be added too.)
>How-To-Repeat:
(define call/input-url
  (make-keyword-procedure
   (λ (kws kvs url getter handler . rest)
     (define in (keyword-apply getter kws kvs url rest))
     (dynamic-wind void
                   (λ () (handler in))
                   (λ () (close-input-port in))))
   (let ([call/input-url
          (λ (url getter handler . rest)
            (define in (apply getter url rest))
            (dynamic-wind void
                          (λ () (handler in))
                          (λ () (close-input-port in))))])
     call/input-url)))
>Fix:
