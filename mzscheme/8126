State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Sat, 17 Jun 2006 15:29:03 -0400
Reason>>> One bug is fixed in SVN. A second bug has to do with bogus
updating of mzscheme/info.ss with the version '(349.100).


State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 18 Jun 2006 08:04:02 -0400
Reason>>> info.ss files fixed in SVN, too
