>Description:
When I install drscheme (either via Debian packages or from a tarball), if I try to start drscheme as a non-root user, then I get the following message:
open-output-file: cannot open output file: "/usr/tmp/mztmp12002953471200295347076" (Permission denied; errno=13)
>How-To-Repeat:
on a debian-based system: 
1- sudo apt-get install drscheme
2- drscheme

(mzscheme appears to work fine)

 Sounds like Debian does have a "/usr/tmp" which is not user-writeable
 by default -- this will confuse mzscheme into using it.  I've read the
 relevant FHS parts about "tmp", and it sounds like "/var/tmp" should
 be used.  Can you verify that you have this directory and can write to
 it?
 
 Matthew -- I comitted a change to "file.c" to look for that first.  In
 all systems that I've looked at it seems to work fine, including
 solaris.
 
 BTW#1: Maybe it'll be a good idea to check for write permissions on
 the directory too?
 
 BTW#2: Maybe rewrap `find-system-path' to cache the primitive's
 result?

 Permissions are such that a non-root user can write to /var/tmp on Debian: i.e.,
 
 $ ls -ld /var/tmp
 drwxrwxrwt 3 root root 4096 2008-01-14 08:42 /var/tmp
 
 Thanks,
 Steven
