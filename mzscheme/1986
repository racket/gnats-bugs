>Description:
When I run the code below with mzscheme (199.14) I get a segmentation fault.
This code uses all-from-except on mzscheme instead of 
the required my-mzscheme.  This should be an error, but instead produces
a seg fault.
This does not happen if I all-from-except a module other than mzscheme.


>How-To-Repeat:
(module my-mzscheme mzscheme
  (provide (all-from mzscheme)))

(module break my-mzscheme            
  (provide (all-from-except mzscheme map))
  )

(require break)

 Looks like any use of `all-from' or `all-from-except' with a
 non-required, symbolic module name crashes. In fact, it crashes in the
 code that tries to report a syntax error... but only if the symbol has
 more than one character! Unfortunately, the test suite happens to use a
 single-character name in the test for providing from a non-imported
 module.
 
 Fixed for 199.17, but actually committed and v200-tagged so that the
 fix is available for 199.16.
 
 Thanks for the bug report,
 Matthew
