>Description:
On my system I have no write access to collects/profj. I start up
DrScheme and switch language level to ProfessorJ: Full and click
execute. DrScheme prints

delete-file: cannot delete file: "/stage/plt/plt/collects/profj/libs/java/lang/compiled/Math.jinfo" (Permission denied; errno=13)

in the REPL and

#(struct:exn:application:arity context (lexical binding) expected 4 values, received 1 value: #<void> #<continuation-mark-set> 1 4)

to the console. If I hit execute again, I get an immediate
segmentation fault.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
>Fix:
I've fixed the profj portion of this error in cvs. ProfessorJ will no longer die from trying to delete a file it doesn't have permission to change.

Responsible-Changed-From-To: eli->nobody
Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 05:06:48 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 02:15:50 -0500
Reason>>> The profj part is fixed, but there is still a segfault 
there...(?)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:15 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
