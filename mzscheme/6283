>Description:
In chapter 20 (list.ss: List Utilities), the description of space efficiency under foldr is wrong (looks like a copy/paste error).

(foldl f init l ...) PROCEDURE

... Unlike foldr, foldl processes l in constant space (plus the space for each call to f).

(foldr f init l ...) PROCEDURE

... Unlike foldr, foldl processes l in space proportional to the length of l (plus the space for each call to f).
>How-To-Repeat:
Help Desk -> Manuals -> PLT MzLib: Libraries Manual -> Chapter 20: list.ss: List Utilities

Scroll down to "(foldr f init l ...)"
