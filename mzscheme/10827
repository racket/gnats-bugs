>Description:
The first module below gives this error:

#%provide: not in module body in: (#%provide (expand (provide-trampoline add1)))

And the second one this error:

#%require: not at top-level or in module body in: (#%require scheme/list)

It would be nice if the require and provide were properly "spliced" into the module body so that the code would run.  If syntax parameterization cannot be made to affect require and provide transformers, I would rather that splicing-syntax-parameterize simply spliced them without affecting them (and that this behavior be documented) than have a syntax error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Error w/ provide:

#lang scheme
(require scheme/splicing scheme/stxparam)
(define-syntax-parameter p #f)
(splicing-syntax-parameterize ([p #t]) (provide add1))

Error w/ require:

#lang scheme
(require scheme/splicing scheme/stxparam)
(define-syntax-parameter p #f)
(splicing-syntax-parameterize ([p #t]) (require scheme/list))
