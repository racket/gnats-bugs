>Description:
stmp-send-message failed to connect on one gmail account while working fine for two others.   The problem is around line 100 of smtp.rkt where a base64-encode does a line break at 72 characters on the one account which happens to be long enough to expose a symptom (authentication failure).  The two functioning email accounts happen to be shorter strings.  Whether using a regex-replace* is better than using (base64-encode-stream in out #"") seemed a toss up.  My fix is below for someone to review.


(when auth-user
      (log "auth\n")
      (fprintf w "AUTH PLAIN ~a\r\n"
               ;; Encoding adds CRLF                                                       
                (regexp-replace*
                 #rx"\r\n"
                 (base64-encode
                  (string->bytes/latin-1
                   (format "~a\0~a\0~a" auth-user auth-user auth-passwd))) ""))
      (check-reply r 235 w))
>How-To-Repeat:
; When using a SENDER PASSWORD combination whose base64
; encoding of SENDER\0SENDER\0PASSWORD is longer than 72 bytes.

(smtp-send-message
           "smtp.gmail.com"
           SENDER
           (list recipient)
           (insert-field "Subject" subject
	(insert-field "To" recipient empty-header))
	   (regexp-split #px"\n" message-text)
