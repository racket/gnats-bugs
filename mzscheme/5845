>Description:
With the following code (on execute or check-syntax):
(define (test stx)
    (syntax-case stx (r)
      ((r ...) #t)))
I get the error message :
list*: expects at least 1 argument, given 0
with no highlighting
The mistake is that the pattern should be (r var-name ...)
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter above code.

    that contains no variable bindings.
