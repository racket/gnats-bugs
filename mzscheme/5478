>Description:
In the example below (that comes from the manual for tools), the signatures
are colored with the color for "base" (what does "base" mean, anyway ?), and
tool.ss is colored with the color for unbound variables.


>How-To-Repeat:
(module tool mzscheme
  (require (lib "tool.ss" "drscheme")
           (lib "mred.ss" "mred")
           (lib "unitsig.ss"))

  (provide tool@)

  (define tool@
    (unit/sig drscheme:tool-exports^
      (import drscheme:tool^)
      (define (phase1)
        (message-box "tool example" "phase1"))
      (define (phase2)
        (message-box "tool example" "phase2")))))
