Somehow either the package system (the part of it in setup/collects) is constructing wrong info, or it isn't adequately protecting itself against bad input.

 Although I hope this email isn't a nuisance, I wanted to say that I'm
 a little concerned because I hear the release process has begun -- but
 this bug is currently assigned to "Nobody". I hope it can be fixed
 before the release.

 Also, we do not rigorously use the "assignment" feature of gnats
 because it is so painful. This is at spot #2 of my list of things to
 do, after the reliability of the server is improved.

 I think that this is a serious mistake on our side. We used to 
 do so and we should re-appoint a bug czar. Technically we have 
 one but he has been making promises and worked on some package 
 stuff instead. 
 
 A project looks as good as the way it deals with bug reports.

 Assigning bugs isn't fixing them. If I assigned all the package bugs to
 Jay, would that have helped?
 
 As a project, I think we're quite good about big reports, but that's mostly
 about how we get them fixed.

 Yes, because we have a protocol in place. If Jay thinks that someone =
 else is responsible, he re-assigns ideally with a more specific 'repeat' =
 or with a test case. There are many bug reports from Robby of this kind =
 transferring responsibility to Matthew. Take a look.=20

 Do you have a sense for what changed here?  I also see this pattern
 looking at the old vs new reports, but I don't know the reason. I can
 think of a few possibilities:
 
 1. Fewer bugs are student-accessible, so more people triage their bugs
 themselves.
 2. It's harder to figure out where a bug is these days, for whatever reason.
 3. We have better tools (did anyone say contracts) to determine where
 the bug is right away.
 4. We spend less time fixing old bugs than we used to.
 5. We all write perfect software these days.
 
 But I don't have a sense as to whether these (or something else) is
 the explanation.

 Regarding the process - I find gnats totally unusable and basically
 ignore it. I read all reports as they come in and if they are related
 to me, I put them on my personal TODO list with a link to the email
 message; when I fix the problem, I include "fixes PR ..." and then I'm
 done.

 To add some data to this discussion, I looked at bugs we closed
 between 3 and 6 months ago. There were 149 of these.  Of those, 97
 were reported in those 3 months.  That leaves 52 bugs that might be
 candidates for us fixing "old" bugs.
 
 Of those:
 
 - 15 were reported in the 3 months prior to the reporting period, of
 which 12 were closed within 3 months of being reported (the others
 were: 2 closed by endobson, 1 b/c it couldn't be reproduced)
 
 That leaves 40 closed bugs that might have been us fixing "old" bugs.
 Here's how they got closed
 
 Actually fixed by:
  robby: 1
  mflatt: 3
  asumu: 2
  endobson: 4
 
 Closed b/c fixed sometime in the interim: 21
 
 Feature request that a third party wrote: 1
 
 tex2page bug and we stopped shipping tex2page: 4
 
 Not a real bug/wontfix/etc: 5
 
 During that same time frame, 250 bugs were submitted of which 119 are
 now closed.
 
 To sum up, in those 3 months, we deliberately fixed 10 bugs in the bug
 tracking system, of which 6 were in Typed Racket (and *all* 6 were
 either submitted or fixed by Eric). The 4 that robby and mflatt fixed
 were all less than 15 months old, and all of the deliberately fixed
 bugs were less than 3 years old. We also fixed a bunch of other bugs
 which were only incidentally already tracked, and were then closed by
 someone else (other than the person who fixed them, usually asumu in
 this time period).
 
 My conclusion is that we do a good job of fixing bugs as they come in,
 that Typed Racket uses the bug tracker more than other parts of the
 project, and that we have an overhang of bugs that we don't have any
 deliberate plans for, and often don't know if they're still bugs.

 Gnats has some issues but in general the process with GH would be the
 same.  So ignoring bug from any source would be the same problem.

 I don't think that Robby's memory is typical: there were always very
 few people who actually bothered to re-assign bugs.  My best guess
 about why it (the process) generally failed is a social thing: doing a
 re-assignment is similar to blaming someone so you need to do extra
 work to justify it (and not doing that work is bad); being re-assigned
 a bug when you quickly know that its not yours means that it would
 look bad to move it away unless you really make sure that you're
 correct (where "really" = work on it much more).  My guess is that a
 polished system would make superficial things like queries easier, but
 the basic problems would be the same.

 I don't really know what changed. And that may just have been because the
 project was in a different place than it is now. FWIW, I feel like most of
 drr bugs are mine.
 
 I agree with your analysis of the numbers and I too ignore the bug report
 system (thanks to Eli's "closed" grep per thing I can do that and it makes
 me happy to do it).
 
 I don't agree with Eli that all big report systems would have this problem.
 after all I do use a big Ajax web page thingy to manage my reports (Gmail);
 one that was more tailored to bugs would probably work better for me.

 That's what I mean by "superficial things".  The GUI operations would
 be a little more convenient, but that's an intentional "little", much
 less important than the other problems.  (You know that gnats is
 tailored to bugs, right...?)
 
 BTW, I'm not arguing (a) against GH, or (b) in favor of keeping gnats
 in any way.  (a) The true advantage that I think it has is in being
 more in-line with tools that people expect to use, so it might
 encourage external contributions of bug resolutions.  And (b), gnats
 is definitely not something that is worth keeping if only because of
 its 90s-ness.  But something to keep in mind is that all in all, it's
 really not that far from GH (which stips a bunch of gnats features
 that are rarely used), so it would be good to not develop high hopes
 that a switch will somehow do miracles...

 I hope no one hopes for miracles. I think the GH Issue tracker is
 noticeably better in a few ways, but it won't fix the social dynamics
 issues that you point out, which I think are real issues.
 
 I do think that splitting the repository and thus the pile of bugs,
 will help, if only because we'll have a more managable bunch of bugs
 for each component.  But I might be wrong about that, we'll have to
 see.

 Yes, that was my point.

 This will definitely help, in a similar way that having updated file
 responsibility does -- but it's also a similar problem of how do you
 go from a bug report to the package that should be blamed for a bug.
 So my guess is that this improvement will also be relatively minor.

Subject: bug reporting, bug processing -------- was Re: [racket-bug] all/14063: `frog` triggers internal package system error
Date: Sun, 6 Oct 2013 12:27:43 -0400

 	
 I had considered writing a separate message on 'dev' but destroyed it. 
 
 PAST: I think the difference in bug processing is due to two changes 
 that happened over time: 
 
     (1) the vast majority of our users are students at all levels and 
 	we got the bugs out of the system as far as they can tell 
 	(mostly). 
 
 	When the project was sold as and targeted at the edu mission, 
 	we were smaller and we told each other to follow some process
 	because we thought a process was needed. 
 
     (2) the new software layers we have developed in the last N years
 	(for say N around 10 plus minus 3) are visible to much smaller 
 	user communities and quite possibly some features are never 
 	explored until a very diligent person comes along and works 
 	though the guide/manual/or something else. 
 
 	During this time we experienced a large turn-over of people 
 	who commit on a continuous basis and with it some growth in 
 	the number of committers (compared to the late 90s early 00s). 
 	We have no training process in place and because we are a 
 	volunteer shop, we are not aggressive about pushing people 
 	to do 'the right thing'. (And when we are it comes across as
 	just that: aggression vs a volunteer who didn't know better.) 
 
 	[The style guide is a minuscule contribution to fixing one
 	aspect of this problem.] 
 
 FORWARD: I see two issues with our general development and specifically 
 the move toward packages : 
 
    (P1) how will we deal with reports about bugs concerning specific 
 	packages? In the past 'collects' were our 'packages' but now
 	they have become something like 'complied packages'. 
 
 	Will we set up a bug tracking system for our external package
 	contributors so that they get feedback? 
 	
 	How will we deal with bugs that seem to concern our own? In a
 	different way or as a subset of the above? 
 
    (P2) I am hearing from some here that they consider a process and a 
 	bug tracking system 'superfluous' or 'cumbersome' or 'an obstacle
 	to real progress' or whatever. 
 
 	Is it perhaps time to just accept (a) we are staying small and 
 	(b) we therefore don't need a process and we don't need bug tracking? 
 	We all just keep our own todo lists around. 
 
 	[I'll refrain from injecting my own opinion here.]

 Sorry --- I fixed the bug on Thursday, but forgot to push to the git
 repo (and I went out of town over the weekend).
 
 I'll push it now.

 Oh wow, even today is faster than I expected (much less last
 Thursday). Thank you!
