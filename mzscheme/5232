 Does "cmd.exe" or "command.com" exist in 
   (find-system-path 'sys-dir)
 ?

 No, that directory is C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.
 
 There's a COMMAND.COM in C:\, also one in C:\WINDOWS.
 
 The environment variable COMSPEC is bound to the latter directory.

 Does the new "plt/collects/mzlib/process.ss" help?
 
 It probably doesn't yet do the right thing, but I'm still trying to
 figure out what the right thing might be.

 Let's see, system seems to work now, but system* still returns #f for
 any choice of arguments.

 It can't always fail, because `system' uses `system*'.
 
 Which choices have you made so far?

 OK, I got it to work:
 
   (system* "C:\\cygwin\\bin\\ls.exe")
 
 spits out a directory listing.  I think I forgot the .exe extension
 before.
