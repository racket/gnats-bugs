>Description:
The contract.ss documentation states that struct/c returns a flat contract. However, it does not:

> (define-struct foo (bar))
> (require (lib "contract.ss"))
> (flat-contract? (struct/c foo any/c))
#f

I'm not sure whether the bug is in the documentation or the library. I suspect the latter. To my understanding it should be possible for a struct contract to be flat, like for all other non-functional data structures.

 Yes, the docs are right, the code was wrong. This has been fixed in
 SVN.
 
 Thanks for the report!
