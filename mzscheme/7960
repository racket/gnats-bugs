>Description:
It is not possible to make another character act like a list terminator  in a custom readtable even though make-readtable accepts such a mapping and readtable-mapping shows that it is installed.

The docs are not very explicit about this: it is said that when something is redefined to an opening parenthesis, the list "is still terminated with a closing parenthesis", but it's not made clear that it must be a _real_ closing parenthesis, not something with a readtable mapping to it.

I think that either a) the current limitation should be made official and mentioned in the documentation, and make-readtable be changed to signal an error when a mapping to a list terminator is attempted, or (preferably) b) the list reader should be changed to use the readtable mapping when determining whether an input character is the expected list terminator.

UNKNOWN::4: read: unexpected '>'

Reason>>> I expected to go with option A, but
I eventually went with option B (plus
clarifications in the manual), now in SVN.
