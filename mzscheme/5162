>Description:
Hi,
I just recently installed mzscheme v200a1 on my mac (running yellowdog linux).  Anyhoo, I was inspired to try the alpha mzscheme because Chez scheme is not supported under linux/ppc, and I was lured by the possibility of syntax-case support.  I have a piece of chez-scheme code that I would like to get working under mzscheme, and I'm curious if the error reported by mzscheme could be looked into.  I've verified that it works under Chez. 

If this is possible, please send me an email reply and I will send the source file that I wish to compile.  Thanks.

>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the piece of code mzscheme is failing on:

(define-syntax clause-body
  (lambda (x)
    (define build-mapper
      (lambda (vars depth cata tIds)
        (if (zero? depth)
            cata
            (with-syntax ((rest (build-mapper vars (- depth 1) cata tIds))
                          (vars vars)
                          (tIds tIds))
              (syntax (mapper rest vars tIds))))))
    (syntax-case x ()
      ((_ Cata ((CVar CDepth CMyCata CFormal ...) ...) (ThreadedId ...) B)
       (with-syntax (((Mapper ...)
                      (map (lambda (mycata formals depth)
                             (build-mapper formals
                               (syntax-object->datum depth)
                               (syntax-case mycata ()
                                 (#f (syntax Cata))
                                 (exp (syntax exp)))
                               (syntax (ThreadedId ...))))
                        (syntax (CMyCata ...))
                        (syntax ((CFormal ...) ...))
                        (syntax (CDepth ...)))))
         (syntax (let-values** (((ThreadedId ... CFormal ...)
                           (Mapper ThreadedId ... CVar))
                          ...)
             B)))))))

 This code looks familiar. Matt Jadud <mjadud@cs.indiana.edu> might have
 a version that works with DrScheme 200alpha1 -- I provided a rough port.
 
 More details here:
 
   http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/mailarch/plt-scheme-2002/msg00049.html
 
 (Unfortunately, the .plt file that I included in the above message
 requires a later version than 200alpha1 to unpack.)
