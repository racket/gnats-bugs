>Environment:
MS Windows NT
>Description:
There is a build problem under Cygwin and gcc 2.95.2 on Windows NT (perhaps other windows platforms as well).

*) macro.ss needs a manual touch during the build process
*) port.c required:
#include <sys/unistd.h>
#include <sys/fcntl.h>

added to the top of the file.  It looks like the cofiguration process is not picking up these up correctly.

*) Also, make install still hase a problem when building under the bash shell in the cygwin distribution.  I had to change the makefile to cmd /c gmk....bat to get it to run correctly.

 There shouldn't be a macro.ss anymore. Do you know what referred to it?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I didn't see this problem, but I fixed the others that you reported
 (plus one or two more that I encountered).

 I think I keep changing this one back and forth, based on feedback from
 different people.
 
 So I got rid of gmkmzdyn.bat, and put the commands in the Makefile,
 instead. Works better for me, at least.
 
 I've committed and v200-tagged the changes. Let me know if they don't
 work for you.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
