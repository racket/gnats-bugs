I would think that the trailing / on the end of a path to a dir is extraneous.  MzScheme (on Windows) disagrees.

 Hi folks - any thoughts on this bug?  It doesn't show a resolution.

 I don't think that it would be good to make them equal -- there are a
 bunch of other things that are similar, like paths that differ on case
 on Windows, paths that contain `//' on Unix, occurences of `.' and
 `..' etc.  So I'd classify that under "you should choose your
 equivalence relation and normalize paths accordingly when comparing
 them".  (Which can go up to an extreme of finding the inodes and
 comparing them.)
 
 (CCing Matthew, in case he has something else to say.)

 Also, path names that end in a slash behave differently (at the OS level)
 than paths that do not end in a slash.
 
 In a Windows shell, try
 
   dir > bad\
 
 or
 
   dir > bad/
 
 as opposed to
 
   dir > bad
 
 Ending with a slash means "directory" syntactically. That's why
 `simplify-path' and other functions preserve the [lack of a] trailing
 path separator.
