 I see the same problem, in the same way. This also only happens under
 windows for me. I was trying it with a dialup connection and instead of
 getting an error message, mred just freezes for me.

 I committed and exp-tagged files in plt/src/mzscheme to fix this bug.
 (Had to fix it to get the bug report.)
