>Description:
http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-12.html
states:

  Unlike traditional defmacro systems, MzScheme keeps the top-level
  transformer environment separate from the normal top-level
  environment.  The environments are separated because the expressions
  in the different environments are evaluated at different times
  (transformer expressions are evaluated at syntax-expansion time,
  while normal expressions are evaluated at run time)

MzScheme version 205 DEFMACRO behavior breaks the SLIB modules
BREAK, SCANF, SRFI, SRFI-2, and TRACE; the crime apparently being
calls to DEFINEd (non-R5RS) procedures.

If you are deliberately changing DEFMACRO, how about giving an example
of how to convert existing DEFMACRO definitions?

http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-12.html
contains only one mention of DEFMACRO in 30 pages of text.  The
paragraph mentioning DEFMACRO does not indicate whether or not old
DEFMACRO definitions can be converted.  Can they?  How?

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Sun, 02 May 2004 15:37:51 -0400
Reason>>> Fixing.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sun, 02 May 2004 15:37:51 -0400
Reason>>> I've added a quick explataion about this in the mzlib
documentation for define-macro.  I think that this is
appropriate place for this note.
