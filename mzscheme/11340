>Description:
I've tried many variations of the program below. (In fact, the original was a copy of TR's optimizer's main loop with printfs added for debugging.)

DrRacket doesn't crash if you:
 - replace `printf' with `format'
 - replace (printf "~v" 'a) with (printf "'a")

It still crashes if you replace (printf "~v" 'a) with (print (format "~v" 'a)), or replace 'a with (it seems) any other constant.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following program repeatedly:

#lang racket
(define-values-for-syntax ()
  (begin (printf "~v" 'a)
         (values)))

Mine usually crashes in two or three tries.

Also, after running the program once, mousing around, running other programs, and other things will crash DrRacket. Repeatedly running is just faster.
