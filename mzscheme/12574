>Description:
(I posted this report on the dev ml, because I though the bug report facility did not work for my setup, but if you are reading this it means that now there's no problem anymore)

Check-syntax appear to not link some things.
>How-To-Repeat:
If I put the following text in a buffer:

====
#lang racket

(struct foo (a))

(define (bar x)
  (match x
    ((foo #f) 0)
    ((foo #t) 1)))
====

Running check-syntax, the "foo" in the first branch 
of the match is linked to the struct definition, 
while the foo in the second branch is not linked.

 For the record, it looks like match is not including the second 'foo'
 in a disappeared use. The first 'foo' ends up on the predicate that it
 generates, but not the second.
