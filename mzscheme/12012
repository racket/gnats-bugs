>Description:
The following program has two different signatures. One is declared in a seperate file and the other is declared in the same file. The one declared using #lang racket/signature seems to be broken because it gives a syntax error when trying to use the constructor of an exported struct.
>How-To-Repeat:
;Swapping the exported signatures gives different behavior.

"user.rkt"
#lang racket
(require "sig.rkt")

(define-signature sig2^
  ((struct my-error ())))


(define-unit a-unit@
  (import)
  ;(export sig^)
  (export sig2^)
  (define-struct my-error ()))

(define-values/invoke-unit/infer a-unit@)

my-error

"sig.rkt"
#lang racket/signature

(struct my-error ())
