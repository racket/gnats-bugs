>Description:
I would like to be able to write this syntax-case patten:

   (syntax-case stx (->)
     [(doms ... -> rng) ...])

but it is a syntax error now. I think that it should mean
"as much stuff as I want, followed by an ->, 
followed by one thing."

 For the record, this kind of thing was doable in eugene's orginal MBE
 system, but it got dropped in the MBE paper, and then Kent came along 
 and reimplemented MBE and claimed he did it fast and portable and nobody
 else ever did this kind of thing. It's a very useful pattern, based on 
 my experience. It is damn hard to implement, based on Eugene's experience.

 Well, we are lucky with the current system that one can always manually
 impelement what you'd want (which is what I did, for my case).
