>Description:
The optional second argument to tcp-addresses in v360.2 remains undocumented. If supplied, this second argument (whatever its value, I think) causes the procedure to return the port numbers as well as the IP addresses of the machines connected.

Perhaps it is undocumented because the contract has not been finalised. In that case, changes to the contract wouldn't affect my code significantly and I'm pretty sure I'm one of the few who are actually using the feature.

 It is currently documented in svn (see below).  I see that this change
 was comitted with the changes for 360.2, so you're probably using 360
 docs.  (I'll close the bug now.)
 
 
 * (tcp-addresses tcp-port [port-numbers?])
   returns two strings when port-numbers? is #f (the default).  The
   first string is the Internet address for the local machine a viewed
   by the given TCP port's connection.43 The second string is the
   Internet address for the other end of the connection.
 
   If port-numbers? is true, then four results are returned: a string
   for the local machine's address, an exact integer between 1 and
   65535 for the local machine's port number, a string for the remote
   machine's address, and an exact integer between 1 and 65535 for the
   remote machine's port number.
 
   If the given port has been closed, the exn:fail:network exception is
   raised.

 I think it's documented, actually:
 
  http://pre.plt-scheme.org/docs/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-11.html#node_sec_11.4
 
 Maybe you're looking at older docs?
