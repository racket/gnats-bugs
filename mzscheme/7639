>Description:
I am maintaining a package for Fedora Extras.
On x86_64 system libraries are in /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib.
This causes a problem in plt/collects/make/setup-extension.ss,
more specifically when precompiling openssl support.
The setup programs looks for support libraries in /usr/lib
but not in /usr/lib64.
I think I got around the problem by using the following patch:
--- plt/collects/make/setup-extension.ss.lib    2005-10-15 17:18:01.000000000 +0200
+++ plt/collects/make/setup-extension.ss        2005-10-15 17:18:09.000000000 +0200

This seems to work, but of course, it should be made more robust.

 Is it safe to simply search in .../lib and then ..../lib64? Or the
 other way around? Or does the search need to be specifically in lib64
 and not lib?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
 


State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:43:54 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
