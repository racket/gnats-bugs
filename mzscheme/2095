>Description:
The attached test case causes a segmentation fault in mzscheme. It
seems to occur only when, inside a module, a syntax object that
defines an identifier is combined with another syntax object that
refers to that same identifier symbol into a module syntax object.
The segmentation fault occurs when the module syntax object is
expanded.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module crash mzscheme

  (provide combo)
  
  (define def (syntax (define (a x) (+ x 2))))
  (define use (syntax (a 3)))

  (define combo 
    (with-syntax
        ([def def]
         [use use])
      (syntax 
       (module m mzscheme
         def
         use)))))

(require crash)
(expand combo)
