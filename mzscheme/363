>Description:
The documented bnf for compound unit/sig's begins:

   (compound-unit/sig 
     (import (tag : signature)...) 

However, imports that don't match that are syntactically legal.

State-Changed-Why:
MzScheme (not the docs) is indeed buggy. The test suite failed to
catch this problem because it used an `I' that was not defined (like
your example); thus, the expression failed as it should, but not for
the right reason.
