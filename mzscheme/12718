>Description:
Hi,

The doc about struct properties:
doc/reference/structprops.html

does not say what properties can be used, and it is difficult to find the info.
One possibility is to search for "prop:" in the search form, but I must confess that it took me a while to figure it out, and it also gives false positives.

It would be helpfull if a list of the possible properties existed somewhere, and was referenced in the structprops.html page.
The good thing about a link to search for "prop:" without false positive is that it would be automatically up-to-date, but maybe it would still be a good idea to at least reference the most useful properties directly (like prop:custom-write, prop:procedure, etc.)


Cheers,
Laurent
