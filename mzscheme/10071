>Description:
I encountered students in lab who ran into 
a problem where they got the following 
error message after hitting Run.

  module: identifier already imported from a different source

I looked at the Interactions Window and saw that 
the students had added both the draw.ss and the 
world.ss teachpacks.  There was a name collision
and thus the above message.

BUT, there is nothing in the message that gives
a *student* any clue about the problem is.

There are two orthogonal problems with 
the error message, from the point of view
of the terminology currently in use in the
DrScheme user interface:

1. The word "teachpack" does not occur in the 
   error message, and

2. The names of the teachpacks involved in the
   name collision do not occur in the error
   message. 

So I would say that both of these things should
be fixed for the case of the Student Languages
in DrScheme. 
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Find a student (someone learning Beginning Student
   languge.)

2. Choose the Beginning Student language

3. Add "draw.ss" teachpack

4. Add "world.ss" teachpack

5. Hit run

6. Ask the student to explain the error message.

 Will this problem go away when we ask students to import teachpacks  
 explicitly?
 
 Since at NEU at least they are adding it via menu, I suspect drscheme  
 could do all the necessary work -- Matthias

 Yes -- you'd get the two offending requires highlighted in red.  I
 think that this way is clear even for complete beginners.

 1. Robby can do this within drscheme.
 
 2. DrScheme can change the error message to "teachpacks can't be  
 combined"

 Do what?  IMO what it does currently (with an explicit `require's) is
 perfectly fine -- and no need to change the error message.  (I'm sure
 that there's a way to do that, but it looks like a much worse
 solution...)

Reason>>> this is a problem of modules and their imports/exports, though i can see how 
this could be a problem of drscheme not doing better with teachpacks
