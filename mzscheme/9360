 Are you running a nightly-build download?
 
 The `fixnum?' predicate was incorrectly marked as foldable within
 MzScheme, so bytecode compiled on a 64-bit machine was effectively
 hardwired for 64-bit operation. Specifically, `(fixnum? (expt 2 33))'
 was incorrectly constant-folded to `#t'. And the bytecode for a nightly
 build is created on a 64-bit machine.

 3.99.0.25-svn14may2008, for a 32-bit computer, returns (fixnum-width) as
 30, but if it's 30, then shouldn't (least-fixnum) be 
 (- (expt 2 (- (fixnum-width) 1))) => -536870912 and (greatest-fixnum) be
 (- (expt 2 (- (fixnum-width) 1)) 1) => 536870911, instead of -1073741824
 and 1073741823, which is what's being returned?

 Yep. Fixed in SVN (by repairing `fixnum-width' to return 31 instead of
 30).
 
 Thanks,
