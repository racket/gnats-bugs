>Description:
The struct forms from contract.ss (for use in provide/contract) and from unit.ss (for use in define-signature) clash with each other.

In the following example, Check Syntax signals an error about provide/contract: malformed clause in: (struct s ((a number?) (b symbol?)))

I realized this because I had been reading the docs for those two modules today.  Otherwise the error message might have not made sense to someone unfamiliar with the define-signature struct form.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module test mzscheme
  (require (lib "contract.ss")
           (lib "unit.ss"))
  
  (define-struct s (a b))
  
  (provide/contract
   [struct s ([a number?]
              [b symbol?])]))
>Fix:
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation, in some sense. Not clear at all if it could have been a type error.

 I guess the right fix is for the contract library to export `struct'
 and cause the error to be signalled on the require?  Does this mean
 that if someone were to import the contract library with a prefix,
 they'd have to prefix the "struct" in the provide clause too?
 
 Thanks,

 Yes.
 
 Another option is to detect the 'struct' and 'rename' forms by the 
 underlying symbols. That is, don't use 'module-identifier=?' to compare 
 the names. That's how ordinary 'provide' works, although it has a 
 slightly different syntax of subclauses.

 Oh, that sounds better, esp. since that's what ordinary provide does.
 
 New code checked in.
