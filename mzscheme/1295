Responsible-Changed-Why:

State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Mon May 22 15:47:37 2000
State-Changed-Why:
It would be difficult to extend the error message in
the current implementation. Like Scheme-based functions, the
multi-arity comparison and arithmetic functions probably
will never show all arguments.
