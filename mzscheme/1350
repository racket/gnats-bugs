Regular expressions do not seem to handle null characters right.

This PR is critical because unbound identifiers with null characters in
them end up causing drscheme to hang due to the regexp processing of
unbound variables for help desk searching. 

>How-To-Repeat:
(regexp (string #\( (integer->char 0) #\)))
;; there may be other problems, too. I assume that regexp
;; parsing just stops when a NULL character is encountered.

;; Also, the error message could be improved to print out the
;; argument to `regexp'.
