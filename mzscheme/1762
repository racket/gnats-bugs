>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
  Create tmp2.ss with `(define x 1)' in it. Then, evaluate this
  program:

     (unit/sig ()
       (import)

       (compound-unit/sig
	 (import)
	 (link
	  [p : () ((unit/sig ()
		     (import)
		     (include "tmp2.ss")))])
	 (export)))

  You get the error message:

     unit: used an unbound or non-primitive global in: include

  which is wrong. Include should have the usual meaning in
  this situation. (If you take away the compound-unit/sig this
  works fine. If you take away the outer unit/sig this works
  fine, also)
