Mac PowerPC
>Description:
The version of the program that you have online right now for the powerpc is corrupted.  I along with an associate have tried to download the file numerous times on to several different computers.  Each time we have come to the realization that the file available for download seems to be flawed.  We really like the product as a whole and use it on the PC plateform for educational purposes.  It would be really nice if it could get a working version for the powerPC.

 Can you be more specific about the problems that you see? For example,
 does StuffIt successfully unpack the archive? Does "Setup PLT" start at
 all? Does DrScheme start a little and then hang, or does it report an
 error right away?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
