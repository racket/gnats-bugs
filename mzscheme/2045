>Description:
the docs say that expand cannot produce `module-begin', but it
does seem to.

I'd like to know when it does that -- I'm assuming for now
that it is always present in a module.

> (syntax-object->datum (expand #'(module m mzscheme)))
(module m mzscheme (#%module-begin (require-for-syntax mzscheme)))
