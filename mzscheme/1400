MS Windows NT
>Description:
Since Boehm collector included in distrubition, user wanting access to
Boehm functions directly for extension library etc. requires linking in a function that is not included in the libs but is included when MrEd is built.

Problem is with using gc_cpp.h:


extern "C" {
  extern void gc_mark_external_invalid(void *);
};


This function is only defined in the xcglue.c file which is not always linked with mzscheme, only when MrEd is built.

Solution, include the missing function in the build directly.
