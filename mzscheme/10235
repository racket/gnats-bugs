>Description:
After applying the sizeof(void) fix I mentioned previously, the build on Solaris 10 with the Sun C compiler fails as follows.  I assume that -fexceptions is there for a reason?  But anyway, as I understand it, libffi is designed to work only with GCC, which would mean that PLT requires GCC to build; is that intended?

 It is part of the libffi configuration, which we didn't modify.

 I don't think that it's designed to work only on GCC (On windows we
 compile it with msvc, which is roughly based on a pre-configured
 version of the source from the ctypes project), but I think that it
 does rely on some compiler magic, so it might need GCC on solaris.  If
 you don't have GCC, you might be better off with disabling the foreign
 interface.
