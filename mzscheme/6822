>Description:
Hi, Could you make it possible to define structs in units? I.d like to do something like:

  (define red-black-set@
    (unit/sig functional-set^ (import ordered^)
      (define-struct T (color left elem right) (make-inspector))
      (define-struct E () (make-inspector))
       ...

so whenever this unit is instantiated I can use the generativity to ensure that operations
work exactly on sets of the right kind. Right now I get an error saying:

  define-struct: allowed only in definition contexts in: ...

Is there another approach to this problem? Thanks - EA

 Please disregard this last bug report, I had restarted mzscheme and
 had not done the require imports. Thanks - EA

 `define-struct' should work in a unit...
 
 You have `(require (lib "unitsig.ss"))', right?
