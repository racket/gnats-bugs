>Description:
DrRacket behaves differently to gracket and racket when it comes to eval and current-namespace. The example in the steps-to-reproduce below gives me the error

compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: ((lambda () 1))

... when I run it (using cmd-T) in DrRacket, but works fine in gracket and mzscheme. Is DrRacket using some subtly- (or even blatantly-) different namespace from the other shells?
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following in a file, e.g. "q.rkt":

#lang racket
(eval '((lambda () 1)) (current-namespace))

1. Load it into drracket. Press cmd-T. Observe the error.
2. Start gracket. Enter the command (enter! "q.rkt"). Observe the lack of error.
3. Start racket. Enter the command (enter! "q.rkt"). Observe the lack of error.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, using (require "q.rkt") instead. No error.

 5. Run "racket q.rkt" at the command line. The error occurs.
 
 The difference is that racket and drracket run the module in a fresh, 
 nearly-empty namespace. But if you start out in a repl and load the 
 module, you're starting with an entirely different context.
 
 If you haven't already, read this:
 
 http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/eval.html?#(part._namespaces)
 
 BTW, whenever I want to test or try out eval-type code in drracket, I 
 set the language to racket/load, which imitates a repl more closely.

 OK, I see. Thanks. Sam has pointed me in the direction of namespace 
 anchors, which sound promising for solving my problem.
 
 So I guess this PR probably counts as "user error". Could someone with 
 access please mark it so? Thank you, and sorry for the trouble.

    Tony
