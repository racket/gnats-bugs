>Description:
here is an apparently windows2000 specific problem. 
(i believe i have done those actions on mac, linux
and solaris, and even win 98 w/o problem.)

on first execution, servlet.ss signals that the 
interaction has terminated and that the programmer
needs to press on "restart". Of course, clicking 
on the restart link doesn't do anything either. 
the browser is stuck
>How-To-Repeat:
open drscheme that already specifies servlet or servlet2 
  as teachpacks
write (+ (single-query "num") (single-query "num"))
file|new, get blank window 
go back to other window and execute 
the browser is wedged now

the only way to get started is to restart drscheme.
