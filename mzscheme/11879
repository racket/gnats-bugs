>Description:
If I compile then run the attached code, I get this error:
compiled/test_rkt.zo::732: read (compiled): ill-formed code [../../../racket/gc2/../src/eval.c:12496]

The attached code is a simplified excerpt from the partialsums benchmark, after going through TR's optimizer. Any further simplification I've tried causes the program to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require racket/cmdline racket/unsafe/ops)

(let ((n (string->number (command-line #:args (n) n))))
  (let loop ([d 0.0])
    (if (= 2 n)
        (real->decimal-string 3 9)
        (loop (unsafe-fl+ d 1.0)))))
