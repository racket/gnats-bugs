>Description:
The page:

  http://docs.plt-scheme.org/quick/

about 2/3 of the way down, contains:

  For example, in DrScheme, if save your definitions so far in a file
  "quick.ss" and add the line 

    (provide rainbow square)

  then you can open a new tab or window in DrScheme, type the new
  program "use.ss" in the same directory as "quick.ss": 

    #lang scheme
    (require "quick.ss")
    (rainbow (square 5))

  and when you run "use.ss", a rainbow list of squares is the
  output.
  
The 1st line should have "if you save" instead of "if save".


The rest of the quoted text assumes the reader knows how to "save your
definitions".  Maybe that phrase should be linked to the documentation
(if there is some) of the File menu of the DrScheme window.  The
phrase:

  type the new program "use.ss" in the same directory as "quick.ss"
  
doesn't define 'the same directory as "quick.ss"'.  That directory
only becauses apparent when the uses has actually executed the File
menu's "Save Definitions" or "Save Definitions As..." menu item.
Also, the subphrase:

  type the new program "use.ss"
  
doesn't say where the new program is typed.  One has to guess that the
new program is actually typed in the definitions window and then saved
in the file "use.ss" located in the same directory where "quick.ss"
was previously saved.  One also has infer that the new program is
actually: 


    #lang scheme
    (require "quick.ss")
    (rainbow (square 5))
    
The docs would be clearer to me if they were reworded something like:

  then you can open a new tab or window in DrScheme, type following
  program in the definitions window:

    #lang scheme
    (require "quick.ss")
    (rainbow (square 5))

  and then save that program in "use.ss" and in the same directory
  where "quick.ss" was saved.
      
Later in the docs, there's:

  Of course, the sword of syntactic extension cuts both ways:
  
where 'sword' should be 'sort'.

 Ok, looks like the issues in the bug report should all be resolved
 now.  I'll close this issue.
