>Description:
According to the (goofy) regular expression syntax, the
character #\- is special with it appears inside square
brackets (indicating a range of characters). Except that
they want to allow you to match #\- as itself sometimes,
too. So, the spec says that if the []'d sub-expression
ends with a hyphen, it will match that hyphen. It doesn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (regexp-match (regexp "[a-z/!>:%\\+\\*\\?-]*") "a-x")
("a")

;; should produce ("a-x")

 This is a bug introduce in 102/8, with the changes to support #\nul in
 patterns and targets.
 
 Fixed for the next release. Meanwhile, '-' at the beginning of the
 range works.
