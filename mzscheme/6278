>Description:
I tried to show the module browser, but got this error:

Error expanding the program:

#<struct:object:/pro/plt/plt/Linux_unknown/exp/plt/collects/stepper/stepper-tool.ss:479:8>:63:18: word: illegal use of syntax in: word

I have a (define-struct word ...) in my program -- might that be a problem?

 Does your program execute or check syntax without error? If so, can you
 make the program as small as possible that still demonstrates the
 problem and send it to me? If not, it's a bug in your program (well,
 certainly not a bug specific to the module browser).

 Thanks. Here's a shorter one :)
 
   (define-syntax (s stx) (syntax 1))
   (define-struct word ())
   (s word)
 
 I'll look into it.

Responsible-Changed-By: robby
Responsible-Changed-When: Wed Jan  7 06:11:18 2004
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    This seems to be a bug in eval-compile-time-part-of-top-level/compile.
    The code below signals an error, but removing "/compile" evaluates
    file, without error.
    
    (require (lib "toplevel.ss" "syntax"))
    
    (for-each eval-compile-time-part-of-top-level/compile
              (list #'(define-syntax (m stx) (syntax 1))
                    #'(define-struct s ())
                    #'(m s)))
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 27 Jan 2005 22:40:57 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed, finally.
