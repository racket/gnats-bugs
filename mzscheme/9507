 Regardless of whether it should be provided from `mzlib/for' (`mzlib'
 is a legacy collection, and `mzlib/for' is probably there becuase
 there was a short time (between 372 and 4.0) when `for' was added but
 `mzlib' was still the main collection), you can get it from
 `scheme/base'.  For example:
 
   (require (only scheme/base in-lines))
 
 but it's really better to just use `scheme' or `scheme/base' instead
 of the legacy `mzscheme' language.

 Thanks, changing everything from mzscheme to scheme and going through
 the 3xx->4 porting guide fixed the issue.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 15 Jun 2008 07:26:52 -0400
Reason>>> Leaving `mzlib/for' as-is, since it's for backwards compatibility.
(And the docs are actually correct, for a change.)
