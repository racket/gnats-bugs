>Description:

Helper functions for the expansion of define-sytnax-defined expressions are
not allowed.

>How-To-Repeat:

the first of these is fine, but the second signals an error that `wrap' is
not defined in the module.

(module tmp mzscheme
  (define-syntax w
    (let ([wrap (lambda (x) x)])
      (lambda (stx)
	(wrap stx)))))

(module tmp mzscheme

  (define (wrap x) x)

  (define-syntax w
    (lambda (stx)
      (wrap stx))))

 That's true; you have to use `require-for-syntax'.

 The error should be more specific: it should say that `wrap' is not
 bound in the transformer envionrment. I'll fix that.

 Where do I put the require for syntax? In any module that uses the
 macro? That seems unwieldy.

 Where do I put `require-for-syntax'? Do I make the module require itself?

 You have to move the helper function out of the module defining the
 macro, and into a helper module. Then `require-for-syntax' the helper
 module in the macro-defining module.

 I did eventually realize that :)
 
 (but not for some time after I sent the second query).
