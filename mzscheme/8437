>Description:
Compiling certain compound-unit expressions causes the compiler to raise an error about accessing an unexported variable "x" from an uncertified context. This seems to happen when a signature is imported but not used in the linkage of a compound-unit. Of course, the signature probably needs to be defined in a different module; otherwise certification isn't an issue.

I discovered this bug porting the macro stepper to the new unit system. I managed to distill it to the example below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is a program that triggers the bug:

  (module m1 mzscheme
    (require (lib "unit.ss"))
    (provide A^ B^)
    (define-signature A^ (a))
    (define-signature B^ (b)))
  
  (module m2 mzscheme
    (require (lib "unit.ss"))
    (require m1)
    (provide a@)
    
    (define a@ 
      (unit
        (import)
        (export A^)
        (define a 1))))
  
  (module m3 mzscheme
    (require (lib "unit.ss")
             m1
             m2)
    
    (provide b@)
    (define b@
      (compound-unit
        (import [X : A^]
                [Y : B^] ;; <---
                )
        (link [((Z : A^)) a@ X])
        (export Z))))

If the line indicated by the arrow is removed, the error disappears.
If the signature in the line indicated by the arrow is changed from B^ to A^, the error disappears---apparently it has to do more with unused imported signatures than imported linkage-names.
