>Description:
typo in definition of '+' in 1.3 Lexer SRE Operators
definition of the '+' operator is the same as that for the '*' operator.  
text should read; 
(+ re ...)
Repetition of re sequence 1 or more times.

Note: the '+' and '*' operators also link to their arithmetic definitions. I think it might be better if they link to the paragraph above indicating that they should normally be imported with a prefix; '...Since those libraries provide operators whose names match other Scheme bindings, such as * and +, they normally must be imported using a prefix:
  (require (prefix-in : parser-tools/lex-sre))
The suggested prefix is :, so that :* and :+ are imported. Of course, a prefix other than : (such as re-) will work too.'
>How-To-Repeat:

http://docs.plt-scheme.org/parser-tools/Lexers.html#(form._((lib._parser-tools/lex-sre..ss)._+))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "doc-bug" to "sw-bug" by mflatt at Fri, 31 Oct 2008 10:46:09 -0400
Reason>>> mostly a macro-expander problem

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 31 Oct 2008 10:46:09 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. Besides the 0-vs-1 typo, the main problem
was a bug recently introduced into the macro expander,
so that the `+' didn't have the right lexical context
(and was incorrectly linked to the arithmetic operator
from `scheme/base').

Thanks for the report!
