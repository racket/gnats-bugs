>Description:
 There appears to be a problem when mixing continuations and
 dynamic-wind (actually after surveying many scheme interpreters, most
 of them don't handle it well, if at all, so don't feel too bad).
 
 When running the code below, you'll find that it dies with 
       ==> define-values: illegal use (not at top-level) in:
       (#%define-values (rv) (call-with-curr...
 Which appears to be a macro problem of some variety or another.
 
 Changing capture to the following:
 (define (capture) 
   (display "before ")
   (call-with-current-continuation idlamb)
 )
 fixes the above error, but still produces erroneous output since "cc
 4"
 is not displayed which it should considering that the continuation was
 captured before the (if (procedure? cc...
 
 run the following:
 
 ;;;test continuations with dynamic-wind
 
 (display "should be pre-wind before-capture closure after-capture
 post-wind")
 (newline) 
 (display "other pre-wind after-capture post-wind 
 cc 4
       ==> ")
 
 ;dynamic-wind markers
 (define (pre) (display "pre-wind ")) 
 (define (post) (display "post-wind ") (newline))
 
 (define (idlamb x) ;return a function which returns x
   (display "closure ") 
   (lambda () x))
 
 (define (other x) ;call ret value of x with 4 as an argument
   (display "other ")
   ((x) 4)
 )
 
 (define (capture) ;capture continuation
   (display "before-capture ")
   ;set rv to current function that returns the current continuation
   (define rv (call-with-current-continuation idlamb))
   (display "after-capture ") 
   rv
 )
   
 ;make a procedure that returns a continuation
 (define cc ((lambda () (dynamic-wind pre capture post))))
 (if (procedure? cc)  
     (other cc)       ;calls cc's return value with 4
                      ;which will then make cc 4
     (begin
       (display "cc ")
       (display cc)
       )
 )
 (newline)
 
 
 ;;;;;;dynamic wind test
