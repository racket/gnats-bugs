	(/ 1.0 -0.0)
should return negative infinity, not positive infinity.

	(eq? 0.0 -0.0)
should probably return #f, while it is correct that
	(= 0.0 -0.0)
returns #t.

State-Changed-Why:

Problems with -0.0 have been fixed for the next release.

Close to what you suggest, (= 0.0 -0.0) = #t while (eqv? 0.0 -0.0) = #f.

Other changes in the next version include the following:

  (* 0 x) = 0 for all x
  (log 1) = 0, etc.
  Complex numbers can have an inexact real/imaginary part with
   an exact zero imaginary/real part; thus, 4.0 is different
   from 4.0+0.0i, and 0+4.0i is different from 0.0+4.0i; note
   that (sqrt -4.0) is 0+2.0i
  Complex numbers can have a +nan.0 real/imaginary part with
   an imaginary/real part that is not +nan.0
