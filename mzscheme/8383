>Description:
A syntax-parameterize form whose right-hand side fetches the old value of the syntax-parameter causes an "identifier used out of context" error.

I believe the problem comes from the use of letrec-syntaxes+values in the expansion of syntax-parameterize. It seems that the right binding form is let-syntax, although perhaps a more complicated set of bindings is necessary to preserve the rename-transformer invariants of syntax-parameters.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require-for-syntax (lib "stxparam.ss"))
(require (lib "stxparam.ss"))
(define-syntax-parameter counter 0)
(syntax-parameterize ((counter (add1 (syntax-parameter-value #'counter))))
  'done)

;; fails with "compile: variable used out of context in: counterNN"

Reason>>> I changed `syntax-parameterize' to use `let-syntax'.

I think it was originally `let-syntax', and at some point
I "optimized" macro expansion by hand to use
`letrec-syntaxes+values'. But it wasn't right, just
as you say.
