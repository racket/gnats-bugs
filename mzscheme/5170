>Description:
Would it be possible to add something like `defined?' back?
It could be done with `namespace-varaible-binding' with a handler,
but that's a bit exessive for something that could be done quickly...
(One reason I used this for is implementing a `defvar' form that creates
the binding on first call and doesn't touch it later, which is very nice
for allowing my webserver to reload itself preserving some previous
dynamic values, but there are other nice usages for it...)

    Added `namespace-defined?' to etc.ss --- not what you
    asked for, really, but hopefully an acceptable
    compromise.
