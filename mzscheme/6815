 You can cache method results, but not like that. Use a field (ie, 
 define with no "/something" afterwards).
 
 Methods are not like normal Scheme definitions. They have to have a 
 certain syntax in order to ensure that they do not close over any 
 instance-specific state. All instance-specific stuff comes into an 
 implicit extra argument (this) that is passed to the method. This is 
 the way most oo languages work. (FWIW, an older version of class system 
 wasn't this way, but it also had the property that the closures for the 
 methods were created for each instance of the class. They're now 
 created once per class, which can be a big space savings)
 
 I'll leave the PR open, because the error message looks a little funny.
