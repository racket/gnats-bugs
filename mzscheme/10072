>Description:
PLT Scheme won't build on Solaris 8 (sparc) with GCC 4.3.3, because the "unix-install" rule in src/mzscheme/Makefile.in contains a line "cd ..; strip -S "$(DESTDIR)$(libpltdir)/starter", and on Solaris 8, /usr/ccs/bin/strip doesn't have a -S option.  The build failure is:

cd ..; strip -S "/usr/local/cs/plt-4.1.4/lib/plt/starter"
strip: illegal option -- S
usage: strip [-lVx] file ...
make[4]: *** [unix-install] Error 1

The simple fix is to remove the line containing "strip -S".

 If you're using GCC, then doesn't it make sense to also use the GNU
 strip -- which does have a -S option?

 I'm afraid not.  When using GCC, it's far more common for Solaris
 installations to use Solaris binutils than to use GNU binutils.  The GNU
 binutils historically have had compatibility issues on Solaris.
 
 The problem is still there with PLT 4.1.5.  I expect the problem also
 occurs on Solaris 10, though I haven't tested it there.  Here's the
 obvious workaround, which worked for me on Solaris 8.  (Solaris strip's
 -x option is probably what you want here, but I didn't bother with the
 porting hassle with that.)

 (FWIW, not only did I not find a machine with the solaris version
 installed by default -- it took me ~15 minutes to find a machine with
 the solaris strip installed *somewhere*.  That's searching through
 solaris machines in three different departments.)

 Perhaps Matthew knows of some way to it work differently on linux and
 on solaris, but this patch is looks wrong to me.  AFAICT, the man page
 seem to indicate that `strip' removes everything by default, which is
 probably not a good idea.  The same goes for `-x', which on linux
 means "--discard-all, Remove non-global symbols".
 
 Without an easy way to run a different command on solaris, the current
 state (works fine on linux, throws an error on solaris) seems to me
 better than the above change (works fine on both, breaks linux
 binaries).

 OK, how about this patch instead?  It shouldn't affect Linux binaries,
 and it won't cause the build to fail on Solaris.

 IIRC there *was* a reason to strip these binaries.

 Sure, but isn't the proposed change an improvement?  Normally the only
 reason to strip is to make the binaries smaller.  If that's the case,
 it's safe to not strip on Solaris; and it's a win to not strip, because
 it means the Solaris build will succeed and instead of failing (albeit
 with larger binaries).  Surely it's better to have larger binaries that
 work than to not have any binaries at all.

 Right -- by "was a reason" I meant something more significant than
 just smaller binaries.
 
 So, I went back and grepped through my emails, and found that the
 problem was related to OSX switching to DWARF debugging info, and
 somehow creating executables based on the pre-stripped starter files
 being a problem.  So I think that it's safe to let the solaris build
 ignore not being able to do that, and I'll commit the change.
 
 (Solaris has enough problems for this to be significant -- in fact,
 some people suggested we drop our solaris build which is by far the
 worst bottleneck in the nightly builds, and we have no good solaris
 machines in sight...  Seems that CS departments are all dumping
 solaris.  (Personally, I'd add a "finally" to that sentence...))

 I'm more comfortable fixing this at the `configure' level, so I've
 changed `configure' and the Makefiles to set/use STRIP_DEBUG for the
 strop operation. It defaults to ":", except on Mac OS X and Linux.
 
 Maybe it should stay ":" for Linux, or maybe STRIP_DEBUG should be used
 for more things under Linux (such as the `mzscheme' and `mred'
 binaries).

 Isn't it better to use it when `strip' understands `-S'?  (On solaris
 too, that is.)

 That was my first thought when you did this change, but probably
 there's little point in doing that if it's not done on other platforms
 too (just OSX) since the build script will need to do it anyway.

 Could be.
 
 Currently, I think it doesn't matter on platforms other than Mac OS X.
