>Description:
With the latest svn version, I'm getting an errortrace message that expression forms aren't recognized for a considerable number of programs when Run in DrScheme. Disabling debugging in the language options removes the message.
I'm including a simple program with the error below, profj/check.ss and profj/libs/java/lang/Object-composite.ss are two files that I know also have problems (complaining about symbols and '#f).
>How-To-Repeat:
Switch to Module language level; put 

#lang scheme/base
(define hash 4)
(set! hash 4)

Run

See following error message:
errortrace: unrecognized expression form at top-level: '4
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 02 Jul 2008 08:53:31 -0400
Reason>>> fixed in SVN; the traversal on set! expressions was wrong
