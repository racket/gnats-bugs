 This is the syntax coloring?

 Yes.
 
 If I add this, then the closing comment delimeter gets flagged as an error.

 DrScheme's syntax coloring for Scheme is currently hard-wired to PLT
 Scheme syntax. We expect to generalize DrScheme in the near future to
 use the `#lang' (or `#!') line to select a coloring mode.

 Understood.
 
 That change sounds great. Seriously.
 
 DrScheme provides more than %80 of what most folks need and serves as
 a great editor for folks who want to do R6RS with any implementation.
 
 Would this change be in the next release's notes?

 If it gets made. :)
 
 But given my own list of things I'd like to do to DrScheme, I suspect
 it won't make it into the next release, I'm sorry to say.

 Yea I know I am so subtle aren't I?! :)

 I am excited about DrScheme and R6RS. The whole theory of PLT as a
 multi-language platform is in practice in a big way.
 
 Anyone doing R6RS can use DrScheme as an editor. What a value add!
