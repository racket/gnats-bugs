Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme\n" #t))
>Description:
When '#lang' is parsed, the span of the identifier for the module's language is off by one; it is one shorter than it should be.
>How-To-Repeat:
I first noticed the problem by doing this:

Run Check Syntax in a DrScheme buffer containing just the following single line:

  #lang scheme

There are no uses of bindings from the 'scheme' module, so it colors 'scheme' red. But only the first five letters are red; the final 'e' is black.
