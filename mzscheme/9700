>Description:
Phase 1: Compiling (during make)
Linking fails because in file plt-4.1/src/mzscheme/src/schemex.inc the symbol scheme_require_from_original_env seems to be missing.

The "fix" was to remove the following line:
  scheme_extension_table->scheme_require_from_original_env = scheme_require_from_original_env;

Phase 2: Installation (during make install)
Script in file plt-4.1/collects/setup/variant.ss fails to execute mzscheme. This is because in Cygwin the mzscheme executable has the .exe extension. The "fix" is used was to use "mzscheme.exe" on line 12. The real fix is probably to handle Cygwin as a separate system type.

 Matthew, to address this problem I made it use "mzscheme.exe" if
 (equal? #".dll" (system-type 'so-suffix)).

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:43 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
