>Description:
If a let body is wrapped in begin in r5rs, it executes twice.  I'm in 4.0.1 under XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following in r5rs; "hi" will display twice.  Not a problem in pretty big.

(let ((x 3))
  (begin (display "hi")))

Reason>>> fixed in SVN; the bug was in internal-definition expansion
(which uses R5RS `letrec' instead of PLT `letrec')
