>Description:
When the current-directory parameter is set to be a directory generated by make-temporary-file, then a call within that context to make another temporary file with contents copied from something in the current directory, causes it to try and create a file with the same name as the directory that already exists. (I've only hit this on a Windows 7 Enterprise OS running the 64 bit Racket distribution.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Clear all files/directories with prefix "mztmp..." in the system's temp directory (c:\Users\...\appdata\local\temp). Then, running this program in DrRacket:

#lang racket

(define temp-current-directory 
  (make-temporary-file "mztmp~a" 'directory))
(printf "temp-current-directory: ~a\n" temp-current-directory)

(parameterize ([current-directory temp-current-directory])
  (write-to-file "hello" "test.txt")
  (define temp-file (make-temporary-file "mztmp~a" "test.txt"))
  (printf "temp-file: ~a\n" temp-file))


reliably produces output and an error as follows:

temp-current-directory: C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\mztmp13142126331314212633464

. . copy-file: copy failed; cannot copy: C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\mztmp13142126331314212633464\test.txt to: C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\mztmp13142126331314212633464 (Input/output error; errno=5)
