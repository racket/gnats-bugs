 Problem identified.  The documentation is being generated with local
 file links in the srfi macro:
 
     http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/blob/HEAD:/collects/srfi/srfi.scrbl#l20
 
 When we are generating PDFs, we should probably direct the links so
 that they're relative to the content in:
 
     http://docs.racket-lang.org/srfi-std/
 
 We can use a Scribble cond-element to do this.
