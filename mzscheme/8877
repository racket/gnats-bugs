>Description:
I haven't thought this through at all, but: I just found myself typing 

      (*log-output-port*
       (open-output-file
        (format "/var/log/irc-bot/~a-~a"
                (*irc-server-name*)
                (zdate))))

This, of course, is laughably un-portable.  It'd be nice if the "find-system-path" could handle this for me ...

... now that I think about it, on Windows one really isn't even supposed to create log files; one is supposed to use the "logging subsystem", or whatever it's called.  So perhaps, instead of what I just suggested, there should be some general-purpose mechanism for creating an input port that does the right thing with log messages.
