>Description:
Error appears twice at http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/let.html
as well as in the pdf, in an example of mutual recursion concerning letrec and let-rec-values.

...
Examples:
  > (letrec ([is-even? (lambda (n)
                         (or (zero? n)
                             (is-odd? (sub1 n))))]
             [is-odd? (lambda (n)
                        (or (= n 1)
                            (is-even? (sub1 n))))])
      (is-odd? 11))

The lambda procedure bound to is-odd? should be:
(lambda (n)
  (and (not (zero? n)
       (is-even? (sub1 n))))

As it stands, it will not terminate.
Your example of the common even/odd mutually recursive procedures is a departure from the norm. At every other place, including the R6RS, it's written as:

(letrec ((even?
          (lambda (n)
            (if (zero? n)
                #t
                (odd? (- n 1)))))
         (odd?
          (lambda (n)
            (if (zero? n)
                #f
                (even? (- n 1))))))
  (is-odd? 11))
