>Description:
There is a problem in the byte code compiler.

Mztake runs well when there aren't any .zo compiled for it.  Mztake breaks once there are .zo
The error message is :

"Broken compile/expanded code or wrong namespace; cannot find instance to restore imported renamings from module"

This error is present in all versions all of DrScheme I tested, since revision 2556.  Mztake works well with revision 2555.  This corresponds to the release of version 301.12.

The error affects all of the Mztake demos, not just highway.
>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce this error, check out the trunk, and run:
   setup-plt -l mztake
   drscheme $PLTHOME/collects/mztake/demos/highway-mztake.ss
select the FrTime language and click run, this will throw with the exception. Then remove the .zo for Mztake and click run again, this time it runs fine.

 That's funny. How about: there's something wrong with MzTake since 
 version 2555? -- Matthias :-)

 And even if this were the case ... it seems like a lot to ask of the
 byte code compiler's maintainer (effectively saying "go verify the bug
 isn't in mztake, please").
 
 Such bug reports should come with smaller examples to reproduce. Esp.
 those from us inside PLT.

 Am I wrong to assume that the compiled version and the non-compiled
 version should behave the same?
 
 I would be fine with you making the non-compiled version throw the same
 error message as the compiled version.  If that was the case, the bug
 would definitely be in Mztake.
 
 I'll try to see what I can do to reduce the size of the example to
 reproduce.  Remember, I do not have any wrists, and I am dictating this
 message.  I will have to recruit volunteers and it might take awhile.
 If the bug is not obvious with the current example, and I have not
 produced a simpler example of the time you want to release 350, I can
 either disable zo for mztake or outright remove mztake from this
 release.

 Did I say you were? Is this conversation even about that?

 (if you were to think for even a moment, I'm sure you could think of a
 number of ways that compiled code and uncompiled code could behave
 differently -- lets not forget macros can have effects and compiled
 code won't repeat those effects).

 I have not forgotten. You're handicapped and I'm sorry. Whenever my
 wrists or fingers twinge even in the slightest, I think of Cormac and
 you and I take a break.

 This is part of maintaining software. Maybe your handicap keeps you
 from being effective and you should consider moving your energies into
 directions where you can contribute effectively.
 
 But frankly, that's not up to me and I don't think it is relevant to
 this bug report, either.
 
 On the positive side, I see that there is one useful piece of
 information: the difference between revision 2555 and 2556. Maybe that
 will let someone give you a hint (I wasn't able to figure out how to
 get svn to show me the diffs between those two revisions so I'm not
 much use there -- 
 
   Eli, do you know how to do that?)

 This is a problem with lazy resolution of syntax information. It has to
 do with manipulating syntax objects (e.g., comparing them) that were
 created in a namespace other than the current one.
 
 In this case, I think it's the namespace shift in "load-sandbox.ss"
 that triggers the problem. But I haven't yet pieced together what goes
 wrong form that point.

 The easy way is
 
   http://svn.plt-scheme.org/view?view=rev&revision=2556
 
 but given that Guillaume did do some research into the problem and
 found the revision at which things went bad, I'm sure he has this
 information.  He did say that this was the 301.12 version
 increment...  My bet is on this change from that commit:
 
  * Changed the internal representation of some syntax information to
    increase sharing across modules. This saves a little memory in
    DrScheme, and a lot of space in ".zo" files.

 Yep.
 
 I can see how things are going wrong, but not precisely enough to fix
 it. Actually, I think the approach is deeply flawed, and I'll have to
 replace this part after v350.
 
 
 Meanwhile, all I can offer is a pair of hacks:
 
  * In "marks.ss", add a top-level expression:
 
   (module-identifier=? #'skipto-annotate
 		       (datum->syntax-object #f 'skipto-annotate))
 
  * In "annotator.ss", add a top-level expression:
 
   (module-identifier=? #'eval/annotations
 		       (datum->syntax-object #f 'eval/annotations))
 
 These expressions force some delayed work at a time when namespaces are
 aligned.

 I think we can get by in v350 with the hacks.
 
 We should remove FrTime and MzTake from the next release, though, since
 no one's using them.
