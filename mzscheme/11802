 Was this with the ubuntu PPA? A russian user had a similar issue when
 his LANG was set to ru_RU.utf8. By setting the LANG to C and running
 drracket this bug did not appear.
 
 $ LANG=c drracket

 Or just LC_NUMERIC=C ?
 
 Is there any reason that the PPA would cause different behavior than a
 different way of installing?
 
 I'll push a fix that adjusts LC_NUMERIC when printing an inexact
 number. I didn't manage to configure my environment to get the bad
 behavior, however, so I don't know whether it actually fixes the
 problem.
