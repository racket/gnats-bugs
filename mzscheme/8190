>Description:
Providing the same internal name under two external names, each with contracts, generates a confusing error message.

I'd like the module below to compile with no errors.  Failing that, the docs should indicate that this situation is illegal and the error message should be clearer.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following in the definitions window in the module language, and execute.

(module x mzscheme
  
  (require (lib "contract.ss"))
  
  (provide/contract (rename x y integer?)
                    (rename x z integer?))
  
  (define x 3))

Upon execution, you'll get the following error message:

module: duplicate definition for identifier in: provide/contract-pos-module-source-x
>Fix:
The newly generated names should have been based on the rename id, not the original id. that's fixed now.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation.
