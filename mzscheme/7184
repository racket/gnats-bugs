>Description:
Applying continuation-marks to a value which is not a procedure sometimes causes an exception with a bad message and sometimes causes MrEd to crash.

The bad error message:
continuations-marks: expects argument of type <continuation>; given #<bad-value>

(I presume #<bad-value> is a bad sign.)

FWIW, the same error message is given by DrScheme 208.
I've also gotten 299.22-cvs16nov2004 on Linux to crash by executing (continuation-marks (lambda (x) x)).

--
Related issue: there is no continuation? predicate.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the language level to Textual (MzScheme).

To see the error message, do something like 
> (continuation-marks 5)

Twice I've been able to cause DrScheme to crash by executing an interaction such as the following. Sometimes this causes a crash, but often it doesn't.

> (call/cc continuation-marks)
#<continuation-mark-set>
> (define k (let/cc k k))
> (continuation-marks k)
#<continuation-mark-set>
> (continuation-marks (lambda (x) x))

Crash.

The crash on an older version of DrScheme running on Linux was caused by just executing:
> (continuation-marks (lambda (x) x))

This doesn't always cause a crash, either.
