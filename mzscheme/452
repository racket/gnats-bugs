It seems that mz uses the ~e flag to format code. It should use ~s in that
case. 
>How-To-Repeat:

in drs, set the vocab to mred and the printer to constructor style.

Fixed, although for some reason I had to run `drscheme -robby' to
reproduce the bug.

 Probably because -x is buggy.....
 
 of course, you can always just set the ~e handler yourself in mzscheme and
 type the same expression in. Maybe you should run the syntax errors test
 suite with the some bogus printer ~e turned on.
