>Description:
When I create a port with merge-input, my program can't read from that port.
In fact, the program just hangs.

In the program below, even if I read try to read from any of mport, iport or eport, the
call to read doesn't return.  If instead I comment out the merge-input, and read from iport, 
I get the expected result.


>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "thread.ss"))
(require (lib "process.ss"))

(let*-values
   ([(iport oport pid eport statproc)
     (apply values (apply process* "/bin/ls" '()))]
    [(mport) (merge-input iport eport)])
   (let loop ([s '()])
     (let* ([ln (read-line iport 'any)])
       (if (eof-object? ln)
           (begin
             (close-input-port mport)
             (close-input-port iport)
             (close-input-port eport)
             (close-output-port oport)
             (reverse s))
         (loop (cons ln s))))))
