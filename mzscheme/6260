>Description:
MzScheme 204 crashes on execution under NetBSD/sparc64 v1.6R (Apr 26 2003 snapshot).  Actually, the build fails until one sets "AS=gcc -c -x assembler-with-cpp" in plt/src/mzscheme/gc/Makefile because of the #include directive in sparc_netbsd_mach_dep.s.

Once this is fixed, mzscheme will build either dynamically or statically.  If it's built dynamically the executables fail immediately with a message similar to: Undefined symbol "" (symbol num 16).  If it's built statically, it immediately crashes with a bus error.  Running gdb on the core shows that it crashes in the GC code (more details if you need them).

Also tried building with sgc instead, but the resulting executable just dumps core somewhere in the sgc code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Building mzscheme 204 from source out of the box (except for the assembler correction noted above) will reproduce the problem on at least this platform:

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
