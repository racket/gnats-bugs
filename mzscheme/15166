>Description:
If a program embedding racket according to the instructions in the documentation is compiled with -std=c89, -std=c11, -std=c++11, etc., segfaults result. This does not occur if -std=gnu89, -std=gnu11, -std=gnu++11, etc. are passed instead.

Segfaults occur at least in part due to scheme_current_thread (which expands after preprocessing into ((&scheme_thread_locals)->scheme_current_thread_)) being null. If references to that are replaced with scheme_get_current_thread() (which should have no effect, since this function just returns scheme_current_thread), basic evaluation seems to work, but escaping errors cause another crash for reasons less immediately obvious to me.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write the racket3m example from http://docs.racket-lang.org/inside/embedding.html to "embed.c" and execute "gcc -std=c89 -I/usr/include/racket -DMZ_PRECISE_GC embed.c -o embed -lracket3m && ./embed 42"
