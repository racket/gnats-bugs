>Description:
I opened

http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/soegaard/listit.plt/1/0/listit/servlets/model.scm

in DrScheme and clicked "Run" (the language was the module language).

A textual error window appeared which said:

  Seg fault (internal error) at 8ee3014

In DrScheme the interaction window read:

  ffi-lib: couldn't open "libsqlite.dll" (Det angivne modul blev ikke fundet.; errno=126).

[Translation: The module in question wasn't found.]

DrScheme didn't crash - this bug report is from the same session.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open model.scm and hit run.

 Note:
    After sending the bug report, I closed DrScheme.
    Opened a new one.
    Open model.scm and ran it.
    Everything worked perfectly this time.
