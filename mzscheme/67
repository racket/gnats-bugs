 MzScheme checks at compile time, of course.

 This is a bug in MzScheme's optimizer. It's throwing away
 the `unit' expression too soon. For contrast:
   (when (zero? 1) (unit (import) (export) x))
 reports a syntax error, whille
   (when (#%zero? 1) (unit (import) (export) x))
 does not.

 My opinion is that MzScheme should signal the same error as DrScheme.
 This should be a parsing error, not a "run time" error.  It should
 give an error just as it does for
 
   (if 1 2 (lambda ()))

 There's no question that it should be a parsing error. I will fix
 MzScheme's optimization of (if ...) so that the error is reported.
