(evcase 3

gives the error:
else: not allowed as an expression in: else

Also, evcase (and the other things in mzlib/etc) should probably be put somewhere more useful.

 I hacked `evcase' so that it recognizes either unbound `else' (as in
 `mzscheme') or the `scheme/base' binding of `else'.

 I remain unenthusiastic about `evcase' (or other things in `mzlib/etc'
 that have not already moved). Isn't `match' more the right idea?

 Thanks.

 For constants that aren't usable with `case', `evcase' seems to fit
 the bill.  I also use `begin-with-definitions', `begin-lifted' (I
 think) and `this-expression-{source-directory,file-name}' sometimes.
 
 Thanks,

 I still don't understand. In what way is `evcase' better for that case
 than `match'?

 I could see keeping that one, though I haven't needed it in a very long
 time.

 I've found that `syntax-local-lift-expression' is just as convenient.

 Those have technical problems. Using `scheme/runtime-path' is better.

 I'll second them -- IIRC, the problems are in identifying resources
 that are needed for packaging executables, but for portable scripts
 the `this-expression-*' forms tend to be very convenient.  Perhaps
 some variant like a syntax for a path that is relative to this
 expression would be a little less offensive?
 
 The two things that make runtime-path less convenient is that it
 requires a toplevel definition (same with namespace-anchors, btw), and
 the fact that it doesn't work without requiring `scheme/base' into
 syntax-time.

 Also, it looks like they don't work outside of a module context.  I
 get "register-ext-files: cannot determine source".  I'm not sure
 whether this is a bug (or incomplete) in the code which uses (and
 always used) only `syntax-source-module', or perhaps it's a bug in the
 documentation that says that the `syntax-source' is used if there is
 no module.
 
 (FWIW, I get this error from a simple:
 
   Welcome to MzScheme v3.99.0.24 [3m], Copyright (c) 2004-2008 PLT Scheme Inc.
   > (require scheme/runtime-path)
   > (define-runtime-path p ".")
   register-ext-files: cannot determine source
 
 )
