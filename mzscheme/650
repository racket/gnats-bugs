>Environment:
MS Windows NT
>Description:
When 2 or more threads (at the same time) try to make a tcp-connect that 
will lead to an error, MzScheme chrashes unless each thread waits for the 
error message before trying a new connection.
>How-To-Repeat:
(thread (lambda() (tcp-connect "localhost" 5577)))
(thread (lambda() (tcp-connect "localhost" 5577)))
(thread (lambda() (tcp-connect "localhost" 5577)))
(thread (lambda() (tcp-connect "localhost" 5577)))
(thread (lambda() (tcp-connect "localhost" 5577)))
(thread (lambda() (tcp-connect "localhost" 5577)))

Unable to verify the problem. I think it was something bad in the old
MzScheme version.
