Hello,

We are students in Israel, Hod Hashron and we learn with the programming language: Scheme. We like the open source idea, so we don't use Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac. Our operating system is Ubuntu (7.10 /8.04) desktop- based debian edition 64-bit.
Dr Scheme doesn't support in this operating system, so when the teacher give as home work- we can't do them…
Please, release a version that support in this operating system =) 


Thank You, Eyal & Itai
>How-To-Repeat:
Release a version that support in this operating system

 Although we don't distribute binaries for that platform, DrScheme
 should build from source.
 
 Is a build from source not working? If not, can you say more about what
 goes wrong?
