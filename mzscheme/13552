>Description:
The docs say that:
The position of a keyword arg in kw-formals does not matter, but each specified keyword must be distinct.

But for optional arguments only ones later than the keyword can refer to the binding of the keyword's value.

Also there is no such thing as 'keyword arg' in the description, there is 'keyword id' and 'keyword [id default]'. But 'keyword arg' means something completely different and 'keyword keyword id' would match that.

(define (g #:key b (a b))
  a)

(define (h (a b) #:key b)
  a)

 I'll fix the docs to explain that `default-expr's can refer only to
 `id's of preceding bindings, and I'll replace "does not matter" with an
 explanation that the order does not matter to callers of the function.

 I'll rephrase to something like "an `arg' that starts with `keyword'".
