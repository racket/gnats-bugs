I downloaded release 50 of drscheme from your webpage in the form of a
*.tar.gz.  I followed the installation instructions of gunziping the file
then performing a tar -xvlf on the tar file in the /usr/local/lib directory.
I set the PATH to include /usr/local/lib/plt/bin and tried to run the exec:
"drscheme"  The error returned by my computer was as stated above: can't 
load library 'libstdc++.so.27'.  I may not have this library, or it may be 
in the wrong place.  If you could give me some pointers I would appreciate
it.

 Which version of Linux are you running? From what source (Red Hat,
 Slackware, etc.)?
 
 Thanks,
