setup-plt has started to look in "~/.plt-scheme/204.10/collects/".
What seems more useful in the general case would be for each "collects"
directory to have "compiled-<version>" subdirectories, such as
"compiled-204.10".  When I have multiple version of DrScheme installed
on a machine (or multiple machines sharing a filesystem), I need multiple
compiled versions of my Scheme project's source files.
But perhaps I'm overlooking some other reason for having
"~/.plt-scheme/<version>/collects/" instead of
"~/.plt-scheme/collects/compiled-<version>/".

 Likely that is true. At some point, we hope to have a more general
 mechanism (inspired in part by rpm/fink) for handling external
 libraries, but this is a minimal thing that is still useful and easily
 accomodated.

 By the way, I braino'd when I typed that report.  What I meant to
 suggest was that the existing "compiled" subdirectories under each
 collection directory be renamed to "compiled-<version>".
 
 Even with "compiled-<version>" subdirs, I could still see some benefit
 to having "~/.plt-scheme/<version>/collects/" in addition.  Although,
 every time one upgrades to a new version of DrScheme, it seems they'd
 have to reinstall the collection source files under
 "~/.plt-scheme/<version>/collects/", rather than just recompiling
 "~/.plt-scheme/collects/" to new "compiled-<version>" subdirs.
