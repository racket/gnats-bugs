>Description:
From the new docs:
[Note: the 2nd paragraph seems contradictory saying "with a file suffix (i.e, no .)"]

#

* If a single rel-string is provided, and if it consists of multiple /-separated elements, then each element up to the last names a collection, subcollection, etc., and the last element names a file. If the last element has no file suffix, ".ss" is added.
#

* If a single rel-string is provided, and if it consists of a single element with a file suffix (i.e, no .), then rel-string names a file within the "mzlib" collection. (This convention is for compatibility with older version of PLT Scheme.)

 In Pretty Big? It uses the more backward-compatible `include' of
 `mzlib/include', not the new one from `scheme/include'.

 I thought I got this error when trying to use it from R6RS, then made
 the example in Pretty Big and confused myself I guess.  Sorry.  I just
 checked, it does work as documented in #lang scheme and #!r6rs.
