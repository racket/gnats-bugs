>Description:
The pattern matching library doesn't understand dotted lists in patterns but upon encountering them complains:

append: expects argument of type <proper list>; given _

The same problem appears with quasipatterns, when the pattern after the dot isn't unquoted.


>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "match.ss"))
(define (f x) (match x (() 'null) ((_ . _) 'pair) (_ 'other)))
(define (t x) (match x (`(a . b) #f)))

    If you need match to work in 200alpha1, you can probably
    repair line 193 of plt/collects/mzlib/match.ss; use
    cons instead of quasiquote with ,@.
    
    Thanks for the report,
