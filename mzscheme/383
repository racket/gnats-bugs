>Description:

I got this message from mred:

  define-values (unit): returned 1 value to a definition context (||, ...)
  expecting 2 values

And I was quite confused unit I figured out that "define-values (unit)"
doesn't mean it is defining "unit"; instead it means that it is a
definition inside a unit. 

In any case, the || is probably wrong.  In mzscheme, you get a segfault
with this error.
