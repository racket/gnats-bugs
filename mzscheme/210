dynamic-wind produces different output in MzScheme and Chez.
>How-To-Repeat:
(let ((k-in (call/cc (lambda (k1)

			  (dynamic-wind
			    (lambda () (printf "Entering~n"))
			    (lambda ()
			      (call/cc (lambda (k2) (k-out k2))))
			    (lambda () (printf "Exiting~n"))))
			 k1)))))
  (k-in (lambda (v) 3)))

prints

  Entering
  Exiting

in Chez, and

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed for next release. Also, continuations have been made
significantly cheaper (2-3 improvement), but this just gets us back to
the cost back when MzScheme had chained closures. (I did a sloppy job
with call/cc during the original conversion to flat closures, and I
forgot to go back and clean it up.)
