>Description:
define-for-syntax would make me very happy. I'm sure I'm not the first to request it. It's just unpleasant to put helper functions needed by a macro into a separate module just so I can require-for-syntax it. (I know I can make them internal define's inside the define-syntax, but this doesn't scale.) Thanks!

Dave

Try to write a big macro. ;)
