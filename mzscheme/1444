>Description:
The embedding test program as described in the insidemz.pdf doesn't work
as expected.  Likely to be a documentation problem. It compiles without
errors but it crashes at run time at the very first statement in main().
Calling the function scheme_basic_env() I get a Bus Error signal from line
589 of os_dep.c.

I tried to get some clues from the mzscheme sources but it seems the
initialization process, in that case, is far more complicated.

>How-To-Repeat:
Compile and run the test program from the documentation:

#include "escheme.h"

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  Scheme_Env *e = scheme_basic_env();
  Scheme_Object *curout = scheme_get_param(scheme_config,
					   MZCONFIG_OUTPUT_PORT);
  int i;
  for (i = 1; i < argc; ++i)
    {
      if (scheme_setjmp(scheme_error_buf))
	return -1;
      else
	{
	  Scheme_Object *v = scheme_eval_string(argv[i], e);
	  scheme_display(v, curout);
	  scheme_display(scheme_make_character('\n'), curout);
	}
    }
  return 0;
}
