>Description:
I had a (provide (all-from help-desk-mz)) in collects/help/help-desk.ss.  Setup gave me an error about 
a missing matching `require'.  But the file in question
was definitely require'd.

The workaround was to explicitly export all the identifiers (yuck).
>How-To-Repeat:
Look in plt/collects/help/help-desk.ss.

Change the first provide to (provide (all-from help-desk-mz))

Run setup-plt -l help

 Do you mean `(provide (all-from "help-desk-mz.ss"))' ?
 
 `help-desk-mz' really isn't required, although "help-desk-mz.ss" is.

 The part in the argument of the all-from must be the same as the
 require, eg:
 
   (provide (all-from (lib "mumble.ss" "coll")))
