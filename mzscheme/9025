>Description:
I'm not sure if this is indeed a bug, or if I simply don't understand the documentation of the procedure "consumer-thread" (in particular, the footnote).  Anyway, I run the following program with "mzscheme -qr bug.ss" and I note that the two output values differ; I expected them to be identical.  Here's what I am seeing:

                          Arity of my-proc: (0 #2(struct:arity-at-least 0))
Arity of whatever consumer-thread returned: #2(struct:arity-at-least 0)
>How-To-Repeat:
;; run mzscheme -qr /tmp/bug.ss

(require (lib "thread.ss"))
(let ((my-proc (case-lambda [() 'zap]
                            [args 'boo])))
  (printf "                          Arity of my-proc: ~s~%" (procedure-arity my-proc))
  (printf "Arity of whatever consumer-thread returned: ~s~%"
          (procedure-arity (let-values (((t p)
                                         (consumer-thread
                                          my-proc)))
                             p))))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 15 May 2008 13:29:58 -0400
Reason>>> easily fixed, now that we have `procedure-reduce-arity'
