>Description:
I'm still trying to work my way through this example, but in section 3.14.1 of the Reference, car is a hyperlink in the code I pasted in below. Since car isn't the built-in function, but a member of the structure train, it probably shouldn't be a hyperlink. Of course, I can see that "car" here is meant to represent the car, but it's confusing to me, at least.

 > (define-struct train (car next)

      #:property prop:sequence (lambda (t)

                                 (make-do-sequence

                                  (lambda ()

                                    (values train-car

                                            train-next

                                            t

                                            (lambda (t) t)

                                            (lambda (v) #t)

                                            (lambda (t v) #t))))))

  > (for/list ([c (make-train 'engine

                              (make-train 'boxcar

                                          (make-train 'caboose

                                                      #f)))])

      c)
