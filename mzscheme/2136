>Description:
Returning a lambda from "shared"
doesn't work?
(It might be i mis-understand what "shared"
is about?  Or maybe you know this doesn't
work in 199.26d4?)


>How-To-Repeat:
(shared [(a (lambda (x) x))] a)
  ; returns "(lambda (a1) ...)", as expected.

((shared [(a (lambda (x) x))] a) 17)
  ; Oops, "reference to undefined identifier x".

 Thanks for the bug report. This turned out to be an off-by-one bug way
 deep in the macro-expansion machinery.
