 I get
 
  current-module-name-resolver: expects argument of type <procedure of
  arity 1, 3, and 4>; given #<procedure:repl-1:2:1>
 
 which is correct. (The caller of the module name resolver picks 1, 3,
 or 4 arguments, not the supplier of the resolver procedure.)

 That's what confused me.  I'll close this.
 
 (And there is no documentation problem either -- I didn't read the new
 docs, and missed the "and" in the error message.)
