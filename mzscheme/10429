>Description:
I distilled the following example from a bug I found writing examples in the Scribble docs for syntax/parse. The sandbox changes the current code inspector. This causes a spurious "access from uncertified context" error.

The macro that triggers it is 'let-attributes', which plays the trick of creating syntax-mappings that refer to identifier macros. I was unable to find a simpler macro that triggered the bug, unfortunately.

(For now I can work around the bug by preventing the sandbox from creating a subordinate code inspector.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the distilled program:

  (require syntax/private/stxparse/runtime)
  (current-code-inspector (make-inspector (current-code-inspector)))
  (let-attributes ([#s(attr x 0 #f) #'whee]) #'x)

The final line causes an "uncertified context" error when run in default mzscheme, DrScheme, etc.

When run in "mzscheme --no-delay" it works as expected (no error is raised).

 Unrelated to your bugm but documentation sandboxes should almost
 always be created using `call-with-trusted-sandbox-configuration'.

 I had no idea. Could you put that bit of information in the docs for 
 scribble/eval?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 10 Sep 2009 11:28:51 -0400
Reason>>> fixed in svn

Thanks for sworking out that it had to do with delaying
bytecode unmarshaling! That information made the bug
easy to see.
