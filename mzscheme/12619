>Description:
Racket crashes inside its "write" function when it's given a very deeply nested tree as input.

It's one thing that user programs can make the system crash if they go to extremes, but it's not good enough that heavy-duty built-in library functions like "write" break so easily.
>How-To-Repeat:
; Run the following program.
; Racket crashes inside its "write" function when N = 10 million, whereas it runs correctly with N = 1 million.
; When the "equal?" test is enabled, Racket instead crashes already there, and never reaches the "write" crash.

#lang racket
(require r5rs) ; mutable pairs

(define (iota count) 
; produces a list of n consequtive integers starting from 0
  (let f ( [countdown count] [result '()] )
    (if (> countdown 0) 
        (f (- countdown 1)(cons (- countdown 1) result))
        result )))

(define (cdr-list->car-list list)
; destructively turns a normal cdr-linked list into a car-linked list  
  (let ((result list))
    (do ((this list (car this)))

        ((not (pair? this)) result)
         
        (let ((item (car this)))
           (set-car! this (cdr this))
           (set-cdr! this item)))))

(define N 10000000)
(define A '())
(define B '())

(time
 (display "create lists..........: ")
 (set! A (cdr-list->car-list (iota N)))
 (set! B (cdr-list->car-list (iota N)))
)
(time
  (display "equal? test...........: ")
  ; (equal? A B) ; Crashes when N = 10 million. 
) 
(time
  (display "garbage collection...: ")
