>Description:
I was surprised that loading behaved strangely with names, for
example, this: (require (lib "string.xyz")) seemed to be working
fine...  I found that it ignored any 3-character suffix and traced
the problem to the `date>=?' internal function in "startup.ss",
specifically, the (and (not bm) am) part of the or clause.  Adding
a first clause to the cond in the loader that will throw an error
when (not path-d) would be an easy solution...

Also, it might be useful to have a warning when both a compiled and
a source file exists but the source is newer (with a parameter that
can be used to disable it).
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate

Reason>>> v4 preserves the suffix in .zo file names
