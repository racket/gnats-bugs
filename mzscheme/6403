>Description:
gcc 3.3 dropped support for several deprecated non-ansi features, including multiline string literals.  Attempting to compile mzscheme 204 (or 201) under gcc 3.3 fails on the header gmplonglong.h:

Since it appears that you are including a portion of (an old) gmp package directly, perhaps instead you could also provide for using the real gmp headers/libs if they are installed on the machine. gmp-4.1 at least compiles fine under gcc-3.3 just fine.  Otherwise the multiline string literals will have to be removed if you want gcc-3.3 compatibility.

 This is fixed in version 205, which will become available in the next
 couple of days.
 
 Thanks for the report,
