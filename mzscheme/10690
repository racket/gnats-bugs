>Description:
expt is incorrectly set to use 64 bit arithemetic on 64-bit systems, in certain cases where arbitrary precision is necessary to avoid overflow.

(expt (expt 2 32) 2) ; on a 64-bit system

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 11 Jan 2010 21:16:23 -0500
Reason>>> The bug was that `int' was used instead of `long' for
unpacked fixnums in `expr'; now fixed in SVN.

Thanks very much for the report!
