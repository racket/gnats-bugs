>Description:
This may well turn out to be a bug in the implementation
of provide/contract. 
>How-To-Repeat:
create a new collection, called tmp. Put these files in it:

info.ss:

  (module info (lib "infotab.ss" "setup")
    (define name "TMP"))


tmp.ss:

  (require "tmp2.ss")
  (display x)
  (newline)

tmp2.ss:

  (module tmp2 mzscheme
    (require "tmp3.ss")
    (provide (all-from "tmp3.ss")))


tmp3.ss:

  (module tmp3 mzscheme
    (require "tmp4.ss")
    (provide/contract (x integer?))
    (define x 1))

tmp4.ss:


(module tmp4 mzscheme
  (provide provide/contract)
  
  (define-syntax (provide/contract provide-stx)
    (syntax-case provide-stx ()
      [(_ (id ctrct) ...)
       (andmap identifier? (syntax->list (syntax (id ...))))
       (with-syntax ([(id-rename ...) (generate-temporaries (syntax (id ...)))])
         (syntax
          (begin
            (provide (rename id-rename id) ...)
            (define-syntax id-rename
	      (lambda (stx)
		(syntax-case stx ()
		  [(_ arg (... ...)) 
		   (syntax 
		    (id
		     arg
		     (... ...)))]
		  [_
		   (identifier? (syntax _))
		   (syntax id)])))
            ...)))])))


then run:

  setup-plt -l tmp
  mzscheme -mvqf tmp.ss  # from the tmp collection dir

and see this error:

  tmp.ss:2:12: compile: variable not provided (directly or indirectly) from module: |,/home/robby/cvs/plt/collects/tmp/tmp3| at: x in: x2532

if you run setup-plt -ncl tmp and re-run mzscheme,
you won't see any error.

Subject: Re: all/5373: provide's all-from and macro-based renaming on export is not the same when compiled and when not compiled.

 Here's what I think the problem is:
 
 MzScheme modules work when compiled in order. If A imports B, and A is
 compiled before B, then things are fine. Or if niether is compiled and
 B is loaded directly, things are fine.
 
 If B is compiled (implying that A is compiled) and then A is
 re-compiled, then the old B compilation doesn't necessarily work right
 with the new A module. In particular, a gensym created when compiling A
 might get a different name.
 
 In the reported example, setup-plt compiles the files within a
 collection in a "random" order, which effectively means that it
 re-compiles some modules, so things can be broken.
 
 I don't know why this doesn't cause problems more often, though. I
 guess we've been lucky.
 
 I expect that coming changes to `generate-temporaries' will eliminate
 the problem (it won't make up new names each time), but I'm not
 positive. We may need to fix setup-plt so that it doesn't compile a
 module more than once.

 Currently, this problem also shows up in the test suite tool, when
 starting up drscheme (at least, it does for me).
