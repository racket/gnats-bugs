>Description:
Running planet create on a package that has already been development linked and built will (a) include scribble files in both doc/ and planet-doc/, and (b) both sets of files will contain absolute file paths from the user's systems.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download scheme.plt (already attached to bug 9429).  Put it in <path>/, then go somewhere else (because you will be creating a new scheme.plt file) that you can create a new scheme/ subdirectory and run:

planet open <path>/scheme.plt scheme
planet link cce scheme.plt 1 0 scheme/
setup-plt -P cce scheme.plt 1 0
planet create scheme
planet unlink cce scheme.plt 1 0
rm -r scheme
planet open scheme.plt scheme

This will open the (unbuilt) sources, build them, create a planet package, then remove the original sources and open the version with built planet docs.  Look in that directory to see doc/ and planet-doc/ with links that mention local directory structure.
