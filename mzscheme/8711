>Description:
This is serious! When I want to run a Perl program, I type

perl script.pl

When I want to run a Python program, I type

python script.py

When I want to run a ruby program, I type

ruby script.py

But when I want to run a Scheme program, I have to use flags.

mzscheme -f script.scm

mzscheme --load script.scm

(For MIT Scheme)

scheme < script.scm

I want a "normal" command line Scheme interpreter. This is freaking annoying!
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this command and see if the script runs.

$ mzscheme <script>

It don't.

 My Scheme scripts run with
 
   $ ./scripts
 
 and the flags give me the power that Perl and friends don't have. --

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "change-request" by eli at Wed, 06 Jun 2007 23:46:12 -0400
Reason>>> This is not a bug

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Wed, 06 Jun 2007 23:46:12 -0400
Reason>>> Matthew: moving to you to decide what to do about it.
AFAICT, it's a change request to the way arguments are
processed.



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:00 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
