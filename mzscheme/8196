>Description:
As always, I'm not sure that there's an easy solution, but the current behavior
is very confusing -- if you override #\. as a terminating reader macro, then you
also break its use within numbers.  The meaning of terminating/non-terminating
characters is a little unclear, the only semi-expanation is the sentence:

  ... so it can be used in the middle of an identifier.

So it seems that currently it should also include numbers too.  But I think that
it's more natural to have it not affect reading numbers at all.

 I adjusted the docs.
 
 I don't think it would be right to avoid affecting numbers; delimiters
 terminate numbers. Also, you don't know whether you're parsing a number
 or a symbol until you get to the end of the number/symbol.

 I still think it's more natural to not affect reading numbers, but I
 know that both of these issues make it impossible.  The first one
 points to the fact that if you'd want to parse, for example, `-' in a
 different way (as a terminating macro), then it would only make sense
 that in `a-2' the `-' will not trigger reading a number.  I should
 have said that changing the docs is the only sensible thing.
