>Description:
This section is written as a guide for those familiar with scheme/base but not mzscheme.  Will not most readers be those who are migrating away from mzscheme?  If so, the section would be more helpful if written with that orientation and were more explicit about substitutions.

The following procedures were missing from the 'Old Functions' page:
1.  'hash-table-get' is not mentioned.  Is it equivalent to 'hash-ref'?
2.  'hash-table-put' is not mentioned.  Is it equivalent to 'hash-set!' or 'hash-set'?
3.  'hash-table-map' is not mentioned.  Is it equivalent to 'hash-map'?

 You're right. The substitutions are currently described in the v4
 release notes
 
    http://docs.plt-scheme.org/release-notes/mzscheme/MzScheme_4.txt
 
 particularly in the last section, but we should move that information
 into the MzScheme manual.

 Yes. I'll add those. `hash-table-put!' is like `hash-set!'. (There's no
 hash-table-put' sans `!'.)
