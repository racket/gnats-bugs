>Description:
The following code crashes MrEd 200alpha12 running on my
WinNT4 machine:

(let loop ((i 0))
  (thread (lambda ()
            (let-values ([(i o) (tcp-connect "somehost" 81)])
               (close-output-port o))))
  (if (< 100 i) (loop (add1 i))))

when there is no service listening on somehost port 81.
It does not crash if few enough threads are launched.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
