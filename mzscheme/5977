>Description:
On any output, if it is blocked with ^S on a Linux terminal,
the CPU has 100% for mzscheme.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start mzscheme in an xterm;
enter (let loop () (printf "x\n") (sleep 1) (loop));
press ctrl-s, cpu goes up to 100% until ctrl-q releases
the terminal.

This is not due to the loop -- just any output, even the
prompt, so an easier way to see this:
Start mzscheme in an xterm;
enter (sleep 5) and immediately after you hit return,
hit ctrl-s;
after 5 seconds the cpu goes to 100% until the terminal is
released.

 I see this behavior in Linux, but not FreeBSD.
 
 Offhand, it looks like Linux is broken, but perhaps it's broken in a
 standard way. I'll have to consult some experts...
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I can't find another OS where this is a problem. Although I'm not
 positive, I suspect that select() is broken in Linux for stopped TTY
 output. (No idea whether it's select() or TTY that's broken.)

 Data point: this is not true for me when running 202.5 under OS X.
