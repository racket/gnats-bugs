Thanks.

 We have a trace mechanism that you can load by using
 
   (reference-library "trace.ss")
 
 This defines trace and untrace, as defined by Chez Scheme.  Note that
 if you're running this in DrScheme, you must be at the Quasi-R4RS
 level.  Documentation is available under PLT MzScheme: Language Manual
 | Library Collections and MzLib | MzLib Libraries | Tracing, or
 
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/doc/mzscheme/node185.htm#SECTION0016223000000000000000
 
 Note the caveats mentioned therein.
