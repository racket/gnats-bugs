>Description:
On my research machine (PowerMac G5 (PPC), Mac OS X 10.5.4), I get the following error after updating to at least revision r11570 (also affects r11573, the current HEAD) and doing a build from scratch (let me know if more build output context is needed):

[...]
make foreign-stuff
cd ../foreign; make all
make foreign.o
gcc -g -O2  -Wall  -DOS_X -D_DARWIN_UNLIMITED_SELECT   -fno-common -I./../mzscheme -I../../foreign/../mzscheme/include -I../../foreign/../mzscheme/src -Igcc/libffi/include -c ../../foreign/foreign.c -o foreign.o
../../foreign/foreign.c: In function ‘sym_to_abi’:
../../foreign/foreign.c:981: error: ‘FFI_SYSV’ undeclared (first use in this function)
../../foreign/foreign.c:981: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
../../foreign/foreign.c:981: error: for each function it appears in.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by sstrickl at Tue, 09 Sep 2008 23:26:56 -0400
Reason>>> Looks like Eli fixed this in r11625 (since the build of HEAD now succeeded on 
my box)


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Tue, 09 Sep 2008 23:29:52 -0400
Reason>>> .
