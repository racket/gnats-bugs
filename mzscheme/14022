>Environment:
Racket Docs 5.3.6
>Description:
Currently it would be very easy for a user who did not know better to use the primary search field in the Racket documentation to try and search all of the contents of the Racket docs (i.e. they would use it not knowing it is only searching keywords, function names, etc... and not the entirety of the contents), which may make finding things difficult for beginners or other individuals. There is a Google Custom Search to the right, but only after discovering this field and experimenting is the differences between these fields fully appreciated. This could be non intuitive for some users and is likely exacerbated by the fact that the comprehensive, "Google" style search has become the default and often only available search in many places.

For example, a user wishing to know how to use hexadecimal notation to write down numbers in Racket may search "hex", "hexidecimal", or "0x" in the primary search field and come away a little surprised there were no applicable results.

At a minimum I would think if no results are found having a brief message similar to "Didn't find what you were looking for? Try the Google Custom Search" (or something to that effect) would help users more efficiently use the documentation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Search "hex" or "hexadecimal" and note that none of the results would point the user to the page they likely would find most useful, the Numbers section (3.2) in the Racket Guide, and there is no hint to try their query in the Google Custom Search.
