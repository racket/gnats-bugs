Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #()))
>Description:
I think this is happening because the implementation of string->number uses rx:number but rx:number will only match a radix 16 number with [a-fA-F] characters if it starts with #[xX].
>How-To-Repeat:
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs))
(write (string->number "fe" 16))
