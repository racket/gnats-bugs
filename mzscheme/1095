Print-convert on non-integers produces (+ <integer> <fractional-part>)

This is bad because print-convert is used in the stepper, and the result
of stepping through a program is different from the evaluation of that
program in drscheme.

This problem could be solved either by changing print-convert or simply 
providing another parameter to control this behavior.  I don't see the 
rationale for having DrScheme and print-convert do different things in
this case.
