>Description:
The program shown in the 'steps to reproduce' is a stripped version of a program that always has run well. It is part of a larger collection of related algorithms.
It still runs well and quick with the last but one line reading:
 (write (length (list-shortest-paths 4 7 0 1))).
But replacing it by:
 (write (length (list-shortest-paths 5 7 0 1)))
consistently causes a segfault <internal error> at some address. Performance statistics tell me that I do not go beyond 650 Mb of RAM. (my machine is 1Gb)
Is this a bug in my program or in MzScheme?
I assume this bug report shows you which version of MzScheme I use and under which OS. If you need more info I would be happy to provide it.

Kind regards, Jos koot

 This problem no longer occurs in DrScheme, version 369.12-svn2may2007 [3m].
 As far as I am concerned, this problem can be closed. Thanks.
