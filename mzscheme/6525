make install tries to execute this bit of shell scripting, which will fail when the current path contains a space 
>How-To-Repeat:
(path in this case was `/home/amedico/Personal Data/Classes/FundCS/plt/src')

[root@kdy15 src]# make install
[stuff]
cd ..; cp mzscheme/mzscheme `(cd ./..; pwd)`/bin/mzscheme
cp: copying multiple files, but last argument `Data/Classes/FundCS/plt/bin/mzscheme' is not a directory
Try `cp --help' for more information.
