>Description:
(define-struct f (a b))
(shared ([x-list (list y)]
         [y-list (list x)]
         [x (make-f 5 x-list)]
         [y (make-f 8 y-list)])
  x)
evaluates to
(shared ((-0- (make-f 5 (list (make-f 8 (list -0-)))))) -0-)
which results in an error, since the list constructor is not
at the front.

I suppose the underlying problem is that shared can't know
the names of the mutators given the constructor names.  Is it
possible to add constructor-name->mutator-names : sym -> (listof (+ sym #f))
that gives a list of mutator names or #f if that mutator isn't
available?

I guess I'll use vectors with gensyms at the front instead of
structures for now.

 I think that we could actually do better with a struct-type -> 
 (listof symbols) function that returned the names of the fields.
