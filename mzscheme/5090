>Description:
I know it's probably early to rebort library bugs for PLT
200, but I thought I'd let you know: the identifier
"global-defined-variable" that the rewritten version of 
trace in the trace.ss library module expects to be 
bound is not.  It looks like it should be a function
of one or two arguments, though I haven't been able to
figure out what the two-argument case does.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define f (lambda (x) x))
(require (lib "trace.ss"))
(trace f)
(f 4)

;;produces the error: reference to undefined identifier: global-defined-value

    Not at all - the alpha release is supposed to provoke
    bug reports.
    
    This is fixed for the next release.
