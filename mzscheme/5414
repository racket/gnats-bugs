>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
execute the following prgoram:

(require (lib "class.ss"))
(define c% (class object% (init-field f) (super-instantiate ())))
(list (instantiate c% ()))

and the source locations that the bug shows are the `list'
expression and the `init-field' sub-expression of the class.
the instantiate expression is missing.

If this were a mred class, it would be worse, since the 
init-field isn't there (mred being already compiled) --
all you get is the list expression

 That's the same as
 
  (define (f x)
     (+ x 'a))
 
  (list (f 10))
 
 In the same way that the evaluation of (f 10) is replaced by the body
 of the function, (instantiate c% ()) is replaced by the body of the
 class.

 No, in that case, there's no annotated code that is executed in the
 same continuation as the `instantiate' expression, so the `instantiate'
 expression should be hilited.
 
 But when I checked this, I discovered that the `instantiate' macro
 didn't propagate srclocs right. Fixed and exp-tagged.
 
 Re-running your test, I see that the class body isn't actually executed
 in tail position with respect to the `instatiate' call. (That should
 have been obvious to me; at a minimumu, the "did it call super-init?"
 test is performed afterward!)
 
 In short, it really was a bug and it's now fixed.

 Okay, I am glad this got one bug out of the way. 
 (As you probably figured, I discovered it but 
 Robby submitted it as me.) -- Matthias
