>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
1. create the directory "Cupertino:folder-to-be-renamed" 
   (or use a different one, but rename things below)

2. Execute this program:
> (define t (make-object text%))
> (send t insert "a")
> (send t save-file "Cupertino:folder-to-be-renamed:test")
#t
> (send t get-filename)
"Cupertino:folder-to-be-renamed:test"

3. rename the "folder-to-be-renamed" folder

4. evaluate this:
> (send t get-filename)
"Cupertino:folder-to-be-renamed:test"
> (send t save-file)
#f

Both of those in 4. are wrong. The first should be the renamed directory
and the second should be sucessful.

It apppears that texts are saving the actual string for the internal
filename representation, isntead of the pointer into the macos
filesystem, so when things are reanmed drscheme breaks, unlike all
other macos applications.
