>Description:
Taking this example:

(match '(1 2 3 1)
  [(list x 2 3 x) (display x)])  ; displays 1

I'd like to change 'list' to 'list-no-order' and be able to pull out matching elements regardless of order, like so

(match '(1 2 3 1)
  [(list-no-order 2 3 x x) (display x)]) 

Unfortunately, this yields a compile error.  Something like the following:

compile: unbound identifier (and no #%top syntax transformer is bound) in: x7

This makes me think there's a uniquing here that doesn't respect that we may want multiple variables to bind to the duplicate values.
>How-To-Repeat:
(match '(1 2 3 1)
  [(list-no-order 2 3 x x) (display x)]) 

should be sufficient to reproduce error
