>Description:
With modules saved in the obvious files:

(module foo mzscheme
  
  (require (lib "contract.ss"))
  
  (define f (lambda (x y) (+ x y)))
  
  (provide/contract [f (->* (number? number?) (number? number?))]))

(module bar mzscheme
  
  (require "foo.ss")
  
  (define (g x y) (f x y)))

Execute bar.ss in DrScheme, then enter the following
at the REPL:

(g 3 4)

This results in the error message, "context (lexical binding) expected 2 values, received 1 value: 7",
with the application of (g 3 4) highlighted.  This is
confusing and misleading; the error message should
specifically state that module foo has violated
f's contract, rather than that some hidden context
has received the wrong number of values.

Reason>>> fixing this to actually report something like you'd like would require a
call-with-values on every function call to a contracted function and I believe
that's too expensive. note that the same thing happens with arity errors.

you can use errortrace; it'll find the source location for you.
