>Description:
The description for `regexp-match/fail-without-reading' says that there is an output-port
argument (like regexp-match over a port) but this is not true.  Actually, the documentation
would be improved if it is made clear that there is meaning for such an argument...

(I didn't change this since I don't know if there are other places that might need a similar
fix...)
