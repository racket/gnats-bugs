I'd like to be able to contract my kw functions. I find myself removing contracts from functions when I add a few keyword arguments. I feel dirty when I do this. =)

Reason>>> 

I plan to document the interface that the kw library would
need to use to add additional contract combinators.
Hopefully then Eli can take this PR over.

OK, Eli?

 I've started on this one by documenting enough of the contract.ss's
 interface to be able to build contract. I documented the simpler
 interface. THere's a more complex one (that can be more efficient)
 that I've not yet finished documenting, but you don't want to start
 with that interface, anyways.
 
 There is a new subsection in the mzlib manual's description of
 contracts. It starts out with a guide-like section (that's probably
 both too wordy and too hard to understand for most ....) and then it
 describes the primitives needed to build the contract.
 
 Hopefully that's enough to get started on contracts for keyworded functions.
 
 I'm still getting the \p error when I try to build the mzlib manual. I
 think I"m up to date with svn, too.

Reason>>> Function contracts in recent versions of Racket support 
keyword arguments
