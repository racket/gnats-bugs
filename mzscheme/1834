 Arlind, (/ 10001 5) is supposed to evaluate to 10001/5.  You can read this
 as ten-thousand and one divided by five evaluates to ten-thousand and one
 fifths.  Scheme languages represent rational numbers exactly to avoid rounding
 errors.  For example once I recieved an urgent notice that I would be
 disenrolled from the university unless I paid my over due bill of $0.00,
 which wasn't quite zero in the computer due to rounding errors.  If you want
 to see a decimal approximation of the result, either use decimals to begin
 with (/ 10001. 5) or use the function exact->inexact on the result.
