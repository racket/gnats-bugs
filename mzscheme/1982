 Quoting :

 I don't understand what your REPL is supposed to demonstrate. The
 symbol 's-a has no name, but the `s-a' selector has a name:
 
  > (define-struct s (a))                       
  > (object-name 's-a) 
  #f 
  > (object-name s-a)
  s-a
 
 The PR's title doesn't help me understand, either:

  #<struct-procedure:posn-x>

  posn-x
 
 Any further clarifications?
