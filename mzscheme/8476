mzc --exe produces segfaulting executables.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a machine claiming

[mcj4@myrtle:24] uname -a
SunOS myrtle 5.9 Generic_118558-25 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-480R

The following program

[mcj4@myrtle:25] cat ~/tmp/foo.ss
(module foo mzscheme
  (printf "Hi~n")
  (exit))

Behaves as follows:

[mcj4@myrtle:31] ./mzc --exe foo ~/tmp/foo.ss
mzc version 352, Copyright (c) 2004-2006 PLT Scheme Inc.
 [output to "foo"]
[mcj4@myrtle:32] ./foo 
Segmentation fault

This seems to happen with 360 as well. (I tested that a few weeks ago, and it may have been against a HEAD checkout from Subversion... I think.) 

We have no problem running MzScheme to interpret the same script. 

I may, or may not, have reported this on the list or via a bug report at some time previous; my apologies if I'm being stupid and re-reporting something. I probably shouldn't file bug reports on days where I'm traveling internationally...

Thanks,
Matt

 Yes, it fails with the svn head -- and does so reliably on the build
 machine too, so it's not a case of mismatched libraries.

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

The executable created by mzc --exe called getcwd()
with a NULL first argument. That's not as portable as I
had imagined.
