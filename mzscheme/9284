Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by mflatt at Wed, 09 Apr 2008 17:17:02 -0400
Reason>>> result is as intended

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 09 Apr 2008 17:17:02 -0400
Reason>>> You want
  mzscheme -i -l errortrace

When you put `-l errortrace' first, it means that nothing
is required into the top-level namespace except errortrace,
and errortrace doesn't export much.

I worry about the order-sensitive and defaulting behavior
of the new command-line flags, but it seems to be working well
overall.

 Probably the "Quick Instructions" for errortrace should be changed to
 mention this, then.
 
 Thanks,
