>Description:
Calling system* from within DrScheme produces a strange error
when the executable is not found. subprocess doesn't complain,
though.  Perhaps this is related to using non-file-ports.  On
the other hand, giving a valid executable works fine.

>How-To-Repeat:
> (require (lib "process.ss"))
> (system* "/bin/lsaljf")
XIO:  fatal IO error 9 (Bad file number) on X server ":0.0"
