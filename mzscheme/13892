>Description:
Guide 3.2 Numbers says "real (always rational)":

"The number categories integer, rational, real (always rational), and complex are defined in the usual way, and are recognized by the procedures integer?, rational?, real?, and complex?, in addition to the generic number?."

NaNs and Infinities violate that, as mentioned in the Reference 3.2 Numbers:

"All numbers are complex numbers. Some of them are real numbers, and all of the real numbers that can be represented are also rational numbers, except for +inf.0 (positive infinity), +inf.f (single-precision variant), -inf.0 (negative infinity), -inf.f (single-precision variant), +nan.0 (not-a-number), and +nan.f (single-precision variant).
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (real=>rational? v) (implies (real? v) (rational? v)))
(map real=>rational? '(+nan.0 +inf.0))
>Fix:
