>Description:
This bug is narrowed down from the error that occurs
when trying to visit plt redex's documentation in help 
desk.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "pregexp.ss"))
(pregexp-match-positions #px"[^\\s)(<>\"']+@[^\\s)(<>\"']{3,}"
                         "      (build (lambda (vars fun . args) `(,fun ,@args)))")

;; => (",@arg")
;; but should be a list of pairs of numbers, I think

(pregexp-match-positions #px"a(ab)b" "aabb")
;; => ("aabb" "ab")
;; but again should be a list of pairs of numbers, I think.

 PS: this code (in collects/help/servlets/private/read-line.ss):
 
    (and (regexp-match-positions curr-cheap-regexp built-line)
         (pregexp-match-positions curr-regexp built-line))
 
 seems bogus now. Does it seem right to you to just make the whole thing
 use pregexp?

 Thanks for the fix. I've removed the use of regexp in there now (and
 improved the regexps so that ,@ isn't marked as an email address!)
