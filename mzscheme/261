Responsible-Changed-Why:

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Sat Aug 23 09:23:33 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The problem seems to be dumped-image loading. (Surprise, surprise).
Under Solaris, the starting stack position moves around slightly
depending on how the program is started. Running without images
makes the program work fine.

State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed
State-Changed-By: mflatt
State-Changed-When: Fri Sep 26 09:28:35 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The problem has been fixed: 1) images are only allowed with
statically-linked versions of MzScheme, and 2) the whole
stack is copied using the stack based determined by the GC
