I have no idea what the user breaks are all about.  Unfortunately, I can't reliably reproduce this error message yet.

 I've been looking into this, though mostly I've just cleaned up some of
 the parallel build code (which at least gets rid of the "user break"s).
 
 Can you tell me more about how you trigger the crash? Do you just run
 "raco setup -P dyoo whalesong.plt 1 2" multiple times, or are you
 changing the sources in between?

 I changed the sources in-between.  I apologize: the bug is rare enough
 that I can't seem to get it to trigger systematically.

 Does the whalesong build run OS-level subprocesses at all, maybe for
 closure-compiler?
 
 If so, commit d7a996ee0bf393b985a is at least relevant.

 Closure-compiler does call out using subprocess, yes: it calls out to "java".

 Ok, will look at this soon.
