>Description:
In startup.ss, the regexp that is supposed to identify valid strings for
module paths (line 2276 in the version I got from CVS) has the unintended
restriction of forcing more than one character.  A better regexp would
be "^[-a-zA-Z0-9_. ]+(/[-a-zA-Z0-9_. ]+)*$".

>How-To-Repeat:
Define a module in a single-character file.

 Thanks! (Minor tweak: I added a + after the / to allow multiple
 slashes, which will be collapsed into one.)
