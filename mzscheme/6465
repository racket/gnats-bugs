>Description:
It looks like the macro expansion of opt-lambda is not preserving source
position information.  I had a (related?) problem in inter-module stuff
where the inferred name of an opt-lambda somehow became 'x'.  
>How-To-Repeat:
In language 'pretty big':

((opt-lambda (x y [z #f]) (+ x y)) 3)

=> procedure #<struct:object:/Users/clements/plt/collects/syntax-color/colorer.ss:10:4>:1:1: 
  no clause matching 1 argument: 3
