State-Changed-Why:

This is actually the correct behavior. (Correct in the sense that it's
deriveable from the docs and I don't know a better solution.) When the
error escape handler fails to escape, the *default* error escape
handler is invoked (as opposed to the previously installed error
escape handler, which is the one that cooperates with r-e-p-l). In
MzScheme, the default error escape handler will jump all the way out
of the r-e-p-l.

 I suggest that a better solution is to not die, but rather to restart the
 repl with a warning message.
 
 Mz used to do that.
