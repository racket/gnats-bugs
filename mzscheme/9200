>Description:
Hi,

I've just noticed this idiosyncrasy with the "struct" form of provide/contract:

----- MODULE a.ss -----

#lang scheme/base

(require scheme/contract)

(define-struct super (a b c) #:transparent)
(define-struct (sub super) () #:transparent)

(provide/contract
 [struct super       ([a boolean?] [b boolean?] [c boolean?])]
 [struct (sub super) ([a boolean?] [b boolean?] [c boolean?])])

----- MODULE b.ss -----

#lang scheme/base

(require scheme/match)

(require (file "a.ss"))

(match #f
  [(struct sub (a b c))
   (void)])

----- END CODE -----

When I try to compile b.ss I get the following error message:

    map: all lists must have same size; arguments were: #<procedure:list> (#<syntax:a.ss:5:15> #<syntax:a.ss:5:15>... ()

instead of the "cannot match" message one would expected. 

This only seems to happen with struct subtypes that don't add fields to the super type. Adding fields to sub and/or using a regular provide statement fixes the problem.

Cheers,

-- Dave
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
The contract system was putting the wrong information into the struct info.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violatoin, but a late one.
