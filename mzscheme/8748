>Description:
DrScheme crashes (the application simply vanishes and Mac OS pops up a crash dialog) whenever Dracula code uses the defstructure macro.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Check out the Dracula sources from:
http://svn.plt-scheme.org/usr/cce/current/acl2/dracula
This will be readable by all @plt_readers as soon as Eli propagates my permission changes.  (Dracula is not quite ready for public PLaneT release, but soon.)

2. Run 'make' in the checked out directory.  This uses 'planet' from your current PATH to build and install Dracula as a couple of Planet packages.

3. Start DrScheme and enter the Dracula ACL2 language level.

4. Enter the following in the definitions window:
(defstructure leaf)

5. Click Run.  On my system, at this point DrScheme waits a second or two and then crashes.

My system runs Mac OS 10.4.9, Dracula SVN revision 8874, PLT trunk revision 6666.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 15 Jun 2007 18:55:28 -0400
Reason>>> This was a bug in a new (to v370.3) optimization that
detects
 (let-values (.... [(id ...) (values e ...)] ....) ....)
and turns it into
 (let-values (.... [(id) e]... ....) ....)
for simple `e's. The bug was in the case that there
are zero `id's.

Now fixed in SVN.
