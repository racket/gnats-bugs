>Description:
Unless I have an old copy of the documentation (again), there's a
mistake in the docs for syntax-property, which read as follows:

(syntax-property stx key-v v) associates an arbitrary property 
value v to stx with the key key-v; the result is void. See 
section 11.6 for information about the way that properties are 
propagated and merged during macro expansion.

(syntax-property stx key-v) returns an arbitrary property value 
associated to stx with the key key-v, or #f if no value is 
associated to stx for key-v.

These docs suggest to me that syntax-property is a mutator, which
attaches a value to a syntax object.  However, Robby showed me that
syntax-property actually does a functional update; that is, it
returns a new syntax object with that property.

 Yep - I'll fix that.
