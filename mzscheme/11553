>Description:
Using namespace-anchor->namespace on an anchor defined in a file that is being loaded that doesn't have a #lang prefix causes racket to crash.

Adding "#lang racket" to the top of the file (see the steps-to-reproduce below) makes things work fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Place the following two lines in a file, say t.scm:

(define-namespace-anchor x)
(namespace-anchor->namespace x)

Then use command-line racket, and (load "t.scm").

$ racket
Welcome to Racket v5.0.2.
> (load "t.scm")

 This was a bug that was recetly fixed.  (But unrelated to that,
 defining an achor at the repl toplevel is unlikely to be something
 you'd want to do.)
