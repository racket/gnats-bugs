Run this:

  raco -<any-random-string> <any-random-junk-here>

and the error says:

  A flag must follow a command: -<any-random-string>

ie, repeats the "-" string, and ignores whatever follows it.

 That seems to describe what went wrong, no?

 Ugh.  I mis-read this as saying that "-..." is the command.  So I
 think that a fix would be to change the error message to be:
 
    Missing command before flag: -...
 
 (But I'd rather if it just said "missing subcommand" or something like
 that.)
