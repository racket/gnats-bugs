>Description:
When use PLT-Scheme to deal with some UTF-16 coded string, I
meet the following problem:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 299.105-cvs16may2005.
Language: Textual (MzScheme, includes R5RS).

> (define a (GetString a-port))
> a
"1"
> (string->number a)
#f

Obviously I want it to return the integer 1.


GetString is implemented using scheme_utf16_to_ucs4 from 
"Inside PLT MzScheme":

static Scheme_Object *GetString(int argc, Scheme_Object **argv)
{
	unsigned short *s1;
	mzchar *s2;
	long n, ulen;
	
	// set s1 to be a UTF16 string
	// set n to be the length of s1
	s2 = scheme_utf16_to_ucs4(s1, 0, n, s2, -1, &ulen, 1);
	// free memory used by s1
	return scheme_make_sized_char_string( s2, ulen, 0);
}

Is this a bug of DrScheme? Or is there a bug in my code GetString?

Cheers,
Chongkai Zhu

 I can't tell - you haven't provided nearly enough of your
 code, so I can't try to reproduce anything.
 
 scheme_utf16_to_ucs4() is used for `string-locale-upcase' and
 `string-locale-downcase' in MzScheme under Windows and Mac OS X, so I
 have reason to believe that it works. But a bug is always possible.
