 Following up on this issue.
 
 Isn't this already covered by this sentence?
 
     For any kind of value other than a pair, vector, box, immutable
 hash table, immutable prefab structure, or syntax object, conversion
 means wrapping the value with lexical information, source-location
 information, and properties after the value is interned via
 datum-intern-literal.
 
 
 The docs for datum-intern-literal mentions, in a parenthetical
 statement, that mutable strings are turned into immutable strings.

 Yes the addition of datum-intern-literal and corresponding docs fixed
