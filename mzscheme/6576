>Description:
Hi, I can't seem to get provide/contract to work with structure subtypes. E.g. 

(module test mzscheme
  (require (lib "contract.ss"))
  (provide/contract
   (struct foo ((a integer?)))
   (struct baz ((b boolean?))))

  (define-struct foo (a))
  (define-struct (baz foo) (b))
  )
(require test)

(make-baz 0 #t)

prints 

delme.ss: 12.1: top-level: test broke make-baz's contract: expected a procedure that accepts 1 arguments, given: #<struct-procedure:make-baz>
[unknown source]: (raise-contract-error src-info pos-blame neg-blame "expected a procedure that accepts ~a argument...
[unknown source]: (check-contract a-contract name pos-blame neg-blame src-info)
[unknown source]: ((let-values (((a-contract) provide/contract-contract-id-make-baz) ((name) make-baz) ((neg-blame)...

Can this be done? Thanks! - EA

 There's no way to do that right now. I'll look into it, but not right
 away.
 
 Sorry,
 Robby

 PS: you can just export the individual operations "manually":
 
 (provide/contract (make-baz (integer? boolean? . -> . baz?)) ...)
