>Description:
When a function installed as the current-module-name-resolver
returns a non-symbol value to mzscheme, mzscheme prints garbage
before failing to load a module instead of producing an error
message indicating that the function produced the wrong type of
value. 

I believe this is because in the function _module_resolve in 
mzscheme/src/module.c, the value produced by the 
current-module-name-resolver is used as though it were a symbol, 
but never checks to ensure that the name-resolver actually 
produces a symbol. I added the lines

if (!SCHEME_SYMBOLP(name)) {
   scheme_wrong_type("_module_resolve", "symbol", 0, 1, &name);
}

as lines 1371-1373, and it fixed the problem (though the error
message is still confusing).
>How-To-Repeat:
(parameterize ((current-module-name-resolver (lambda args "I'm not a symbol!")))
    (dynamic-require '(a module path that needs resolving) 'a))

breaks in unpatched mzscheme (it consumes huge amounts of memory
and doesn't seem to terminate on my machine), but with my patch
just produces a message indicating the type error.
