>Description:
This page:
http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/collects.html

has a fairly outdated introduction (it uses v3 style `require') and says the following incorrect things about `lib':

"In general, the rel-string in (lib rel-string) consists of one or more path elements that name collections, and then a final path element that names a library file; the path elements are separated by /. If the final element has no file suffix, then /main.ss is implicitly appended to the path."

This isn't true for the rel-string "foo/bar", for example.
