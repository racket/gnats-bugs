>Description:

Sometimes, on the mac, mzscheme evaluates it's own output

>How-To-Repeat:

1: start up mzscheme.
2: evaluate (current-load (lambda (x) (display x) (newline)))
3: drag some files on to mzscheme.

It will try to evaluate the file names (resulting in lots of unbound ids)

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed indirectly: dragging to MzScheme now types (load <file>) to
output, thus exploiting the apparent weirdness here to make the effect
of dragging to a running MzScheme more well-defined.
