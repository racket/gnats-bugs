 MzScheme uses inexact numbers for certain operations.  "log" is one 
 of them.  In fact, we use IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, so their 
 behavior is well-documented.  As you point out, inexact numbers 
 are... well, inexact.  I think you will find this to be a problem 
 with _any_ floating-point number implementation.
