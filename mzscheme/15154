>Description:
Racket 6.2.1 is failing to build on my OS X 10.11 GM system. I first ran in to this while testing the formula under Mac Homebrew. https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/43993 (That bug report includes full build logs.)

The build failure also happens outside Homebrew when I download the 6.2.1 distribution and try to build it manually.

I get errors like the following.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install Mac OS X 10.11 GM candidate and Xcode 7 GM candidate.

Then:

wget http://mirror.racket-lang.org/installers/6.2.1/racket-minimal-6.2.1-src-builtpkgs.tgz
tar xf racket-minimal-6.2.1-src-builtpkgs.tgz
cd racket-6.2.1
cd src
./configure --disable-debug --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-macprefix --prefix=/tmp/test-racket
make

To build v6.2.1, you could specify an alternate SDK with a
`configure` argument of the form `--enable-sdk6=...`. I'm
not sure of an approved source of older SDKs, though; my
updated XCode installation seems to have only the 10.11 SDK
(but I have older SDKs in various places on my filesystem).

 Thanks!
 
 Emailing instead of commenting since I don't have a login on the bug 
 tracker and don't see how to make one.
 
 Older versions of Xcode can still be used and are still supported on 
 newer versions of OS X. They carry the older SDKs internally, and you 
 can use them either directly or by using `xcode-select` to switch to 
 that version of Xcode for all build tools.
 
 You can't download old Xcodes from the app store, but they are available 
 as standalone installers from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/. 
 The convention I've seen (and use myself) for installing multiple 
 versions side by side is to manually rename Xcode.app to 
 Xcode-<version>.app for all installations except the App Store-managed one.
 
 Cheers,
 Andrew
