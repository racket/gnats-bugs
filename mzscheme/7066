>Description:
A continuation is captured on the connection thread. The connection thread is then shut down via custodian-shutdown-all.

custodian-shutdown-all happens when:
 * e.g. the connection is allowed to time out
 * e.g. the protocol version is < 1.1 and the connection thread is shut down after each request

Continuations captured on this thread cannot be invoked and result in the following error message:
Servlet exception:
"default-load-handler: the custodian has been shut down: #<custodian>\n"
display: output port is closed


<GregP>
Note: the following program illustrates the cause of the bug:
;; the first line is a comment
(module foo mzscheme

  (define global-k #f)
  (define sema (make-semaphore))

  (let ([thread-cust (make-custodian)])
    (parameterize ([current-custodian thread-cust])
      (thread
       (lambda ()
         (with-handlers ([void
                          (lambda (the-exn)
                            (call-with-input-file "foo.ss"
                              (lambda (i-port)
                                (display (read-line i-port))))
                            (newline))])
           (if (let/cc k
                 (set! global-k k)
                 #f)
               (error "should go to the error handler now")
               (begin
                 (printf "second branch~n")
                 (semaphore-post sema)))))))
    (thread
     (lambda ()
       (semaphore-wait sema)

       ;; if you uncomment the next line, you will unveil
       ;; the source of all my woes:
       ;(custodian-shutdown-all thread-cust)
       (global-k #t)))))
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Visit add.ss using wget.
2. Get URL from the action of the form in the resulting response.
3. Use this URL to wget another page.

(Note: quote the URL on the command-line using single-quotes.)

Results:
* wget will spin then timeout on the last page.
* Command-line output from Web server is as above.
