>Description:
MzScheme was in the backgroud, doing nothing (exit had been evaluated)
and it went into the debugger with this message:

 Bus Error at 23040C2F 
   while reading word from 23040C31 in supervisor data space

"sc6" couldn't find a stack, and "es" didn't work. Neither did "rs"
or "rb" after a couple of "es" attempts.
>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot reproduce this (yet...)
