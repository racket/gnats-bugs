>Description:
In file:///C:/Program%20Files/PLT-FULL-3.99.0.23/doc/reference/case.html#(form~20((collects~20scheme~20private~20more-scheme..ss)~20case)), which documents syntax 'case' I read:

"For the selected case-clause,
the results of the last then-expr,
which is in tail position with respect to the cond form,
are the results for the whole cond form."

I think this should be:

"For the selected case-clause,
the results of the last then-expr,
which is in tail position with respect to the case form,
                                              ^^^^
are the results for the whole case form."
                              ^^^^

Kind regards, Jos Koot
