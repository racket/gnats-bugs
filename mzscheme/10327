>How-To-Repeat:
In the preference file, set the autosave delay to 10

 (plt:framework-pref:framework:autosave-delay 10)

then boot DrScheme under VMWare, type something in the definition window then wait for about 10 seconds for the autosave feature to trigger. The stack trace dialog box should pop up on its own. 

Our profiles are mounted over a network path. I am not sure whether this is necessary for the bug to occur. We discovered this bug while stress-testing a tool I have been developing called "tool for logging user behavior." After more investigating I was able to find that:

1. I cannot reproduce under Linux
2. I cannot reproduce under Windows running natively
3. I can reproduce under Windows running in vmware, with my tool OFF.
4. I can reproduce under Windows running in vmware, with my tool ON.

So I don't think that my tool is what's causing the bug. 

I would be happy to help you investigate this bug further if you decide to tackle it, for instance by running in debug builds of DrScheme under our VMWare set up.

 At first glance, this appears to be a bug somewhere underneath the
 Scheme layer; somewhere either in Windows itself, or in the way
 mzscheme opens files under windows.
 
 I've cc'd Matthew to see if he knows anything. I've also added bugs
 and adjusted the subject line so this is recorded in the PR.
 
 One thing to try: can you open the file yourself with
 (open-output-file
 "\\win.cs.brown.edu\dfs\home\jeakle\.winprofile\AppData\PLT
 Scheme\PLT-autosave-toc"), perhaps passing 'truncate if the file
 already exists?

 I tried that and it did not tickle the bug. However, during that
 session I was not able to tickle the bug to normal way either. So it
 seems that it is more interment than I first realized.
