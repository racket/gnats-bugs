>Description:
For example, running this program

(module foo mzscheme

(require
 ;; imagine 25 modules here
 (planet "fmt.ss"       ("ashinn"      "fmt.plt"))
 )

(define cat 'yow))

yields simply

foo.ss:8:8: module: identifier is already imported at: cat in: (define-values (cat) (quote yow))

but it would be nice if it instead said something like

foo.ss:8:8: module: identifier is already
imported (from "(planet "fmt.ss" ("ashinn" "fmt.plt"))") at: cat
in: (define-values (cat) (quote yow))

 Run the program in drscheme and enjoy the high-lighting of the two  
 conflicting module names. -- Matthias

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by eli at Tue, 07 Aug 2007 21:30:30 -0400
Reason>>> Looks like there might be something there.


Responsible changed from "robby" to "mflatt" by robby at Tue, 07 Aug 2007 22:08:19 -0400
Reason>>> Not a drscheme thing, but a mz thing (at least to start with).
