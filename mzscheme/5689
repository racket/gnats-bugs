>Description:
The second result of 
(embedding-executable-put-file-extension+style+filters #t)
under macos x is '(packages-ok).

Additionally, (embedding-executable-is-directory? #t)
also returns #t.

But, there is no put-directory function and get-directory
doesn't take '(packages-ok) as a style argument, so I'm
not sure what to do with these results.

Note: some kind of answer is needed for this before
the v201 release (but not necessarily tonight!)

 I'm not sure what's wrong. On my machine, `get-directory' accepts
 '(packages-ok).

 Sorry -- that was before I realized the trick of first creating the
 directory with the dialog and then selecting it. I had assumed that I
 should still be using put-file.
 
 I will close the PR.
 
 My latest problem: removing the hash tables from string-constants. arg.
