>Description:
I'm running the web server. The server only survived a few hours, after which I got the following messages on std out.

The last line repeats again and again (presumably very fast). I'm redirecting std out to a file, and the file reaches 7 or 8 gigabytes in size.

"pid # 31340 run gdb "gdb ./mzscheme3m 31340" or kill process.
Error detected 11
Error detected 11
Error detected 11
Error detected 11"
...

The lines before this in the file are normal operation - nothing signifying a problem. I saw this once before, a couple of nights ago, but I lost the log file (too large to copy) and forgot the precise wording of the error message.

I presume gdb can give more feedback but I don't know enough C-level programming to debug. Next time it happens I'll see if I can get a backtrace. Otherwise, if there're any tips you can give me I'd be grateful.

Many thanks,

-- Dave

 I have no idea what this could be; I assume it is a MzScheme-level error.

 This gdb stuff slipped into v4.1.4 accidentally, and I removed it
 before 4.1.5. It "should" have been a seg-fault crash.
 
 But, then, the interesting question is why there was a crash...

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:44:30 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
