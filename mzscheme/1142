 You compiled MzScheme to use Solaris threads, right? If that wasn't
 your intention, then there might be something wrong with the make
 files.
 
 If you did mean to compile for Solaris threads, then I don't know
 what's going wrong. The thr_create() system call is failing when
 MzScheme (actually, the garbage collector) tries to create an internal
 maintenance thread. It might be helpful to kknow the error code returne
 dby thr_create(). To get it, replace lines 772-776 in the file
 plt/src/mzscheme/gc/solaris_threads with
 
  {
     int err;
     if ((err = thr_create(0 /* stack */, 0 /* stack_size */, GC_thr_daemon,
     		   0 /* arg */, THR_DETACHED | THR_DAEMON,
     		   &tid /* thread_id */)) != 0) {
         printf("error code is %d\n", err);
     	ABORT("Cant fork daemon");
     }
  }
 
 Alternatively, I expect that you can get rid of the problem by
 compiling in the default mode, which doesn't use Solaris threads to
 implement MzScheme threads.

 I haven't tried compiling with gcc 2.95 under Solaris, yet. It's
 possible that some of the warnings you see are relevant, due to changes
 in the compiler that affect Sparc compilation but not x86, but it will
 be a while before I can check that.
