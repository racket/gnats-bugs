>Description:
I don't think there's much that can be done now, but I just wanted to point out that set! function names are inconsistent. When a struct is mutable, you get set-id-field-id! functions, but setting multiple values is called set!-values.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Pretend you don't really know Racket all that well.
2. Make a struct mutable while trying to ignore all the benefits of keeping code functional.
3. Remember that you recently made the mistake of trying to call "set-values!" with the bang at the end.
4. Think you're clever by calling "set!-id-field-id" without having to look at the docs.
5. Be confused.

 I think the only thing to be done now is add `set-values!' as an
 alias, but that would be inconsistent with `let*-values' and
 `letrec-values'.

 The general naming convention is that imperative procedures end with
 `!', which I think is the more significant convention.

 Why not 'set!-id-field-id' as an alias? That seems to be consistent with
 all the others.
