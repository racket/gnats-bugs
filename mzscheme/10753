At:

In the text at the bottom of the page:
"In general, the right-hand side of a with-handlers binding is a pattern, just like in syntax-case. In fact, a with-handlers form is just a syntax-case form turned partially inside-out."

I suppose this is talking about `with-syntax' and not `with-handlers'.

By the way, I'd really appreciate a simpler example of `with-syntax', e.g. one that does not use the `...' notation, but which shows clearly the difference between patterns, code, syntax, etc.
so that I know when to put the #' and when not to.

 I added two examples for `with-syntax' that should help.

 I fixed this part, so I'll close the bug.

 To clarify, the added examples are to the reference page, not the
 guide page.
