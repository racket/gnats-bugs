 Can you say more about why you'd like to do this? It's not that it's
 difficult to add, but that there are several path configurations that
 work together and that might need to be adjusted together.
 
 The `make install' step of building configures the "collects" directory
 path that's stored in the binary. It can vary under Unix, for example,
 depending on whether you create an "in-place" installation or a
 "Unix-style" installation.

 I'm working on the Debian packaging for racket.  According to the Linux
 File Hierarchy Standard (and thus Debian policy), architecture
 independent files should be stored in /usr/share, and architecture
 dependent files in /usr/lib. The simplest way to do this seems to be
 install but the small number of compiled/$ARCH collects subdirectories
 into /usr/share and add a few symlinks.  From my point of view it would
 be ideal if racket could look in two different places for files from the
 same collection (not sure about terminology here; I'm thinking
 about e.g. collects/frtime); but I understand this might take work, and
 the motivation is not necessarily that high.

 The patch below seems to work ok (at least to the point of running #lang
 slideshow). Of course this isn't configurable, or even necessarily
 desirable for most people.
