>Description:
I believe that there are also some memory problems here. Recently, I have
been running out of memory very quickly when working on drscheme; this is
the best I could do to reproduce the memory problem.

>How-To-Repeat:
;; stick this in a file and start up mred with -f filename.
;; also works in the repl.

(define f (make-object frame% "frame"))
(send f show #t)
(define d (make-object dialog% "dialog" f))
(begin (thread (lambda () (sleep 1) (custodian-shutdown-all)))
       (send d show #t))

 The program you sent doesn't actually kill the eventspace. Instead, it
 calls `custodian-shutdown-all' with 0 arguments, and that makes
 MzScheme crash on any platform (not a surprising bug, but it is an
 unusual oversight in the test suite). I've fixed the bug for the next
 release.
 
 When I add (current-custodian) as the argument, the frame and dialog
 are closed properly. MrEd does get a bit upset when its main eventspace
 is shut down, but it reports an error rather than crashing.

 I have seen this once (I got the system into a state where it wouldn't
 create windows for MrEd), but I haven't been able to reproduce it so
 far. Also, it wasn't clear in the case I saw whether DrScheme/MrEd was
 to blame.
 
 I'll commit and exp-tag a GC/MzScheme/MrEd that fixes the known
 memory-crashing problem.

 Whoops.

 My problems should not be drscheme-specific, since I am shutting down
 drscheme's eventspace. Is sgc available for windows?
