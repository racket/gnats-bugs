>Description:

When I run this program:

(define x 1)
(constant-name 'x)
(invoke-open-unit/sig (unit/sig (x) (import) (define x 2)))

I get the message:

invoke-open-unit/sig: improper form in: (invoke-open-unit/sig (unit/sig (x) (...

but, I can't figure out from the manual why that's wrong. When I get rid of
the constant-name stuff, it is okay -- is it just a bad error message?

>How-To-Repeat:
	
?? - I can't repeat it - Matthew

I tried it again, and it rebound x to 2. Is that right?

No, that isn't right. Fixed.

>Fix:

Fixed bug in invoke-open-unit redefining constants.
