>Description:
I can't open the various language manuals from within DrScheme's helpdesk.
I'm presented with the error, e.g., 

Cannot display "file:/home2/cobbe/plt/collects/doc/mzscheme/index.htm":
open-output-file: cannot open output file:
"/usr/tmp/mredimg948294614-893157841" (17)

The specified file (/usr/tmp/mredimgBLAHBLAHBLAH) exists, has size 0,
has permissions 0664 (as usual for RedHat), and belongs to me.

On a hunch, I checked 17 against a list of errno codes -- it's EEXIST;
file already exists.

======

I'd have sent the bug report via the help desk, but our local sysadmins,
in their infinite wisdom, have blocked outgoing SMTP traffic except from
our netscape mail server.

The other fields from the helpdesk bug form, if they're useful:

Environment: unix (i386-linux)
Tools: ("syncheck" "stepper" "unit-bundle")
Docs Installed: ("help" "mzscheme" "r5rs" "icons" "drscheme" "teachpack" "misclib" "mred")
Collections: (("/home2/cobbe/plt/collects" ("browser" "afm" "cogen" "compiler" "drscheme" "graphics" "stepper" "hierlist" "icons" "make" "mzlib" "mred" "games" "mzscheme" "net" "help" "zodiac" "userspce" "dynext" "launcher" "drscheme-jr" "errortrace" "framework" "slibinit" "xml" "htdp" "doc")))

And, FWIW, I'm using glibc2, so I had to dl source and build mzscheme/mred
myself.  Everything I've got is based on the Unix source bundle.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start DrScheme.  Open the help desk.  Choose 'manuals' in the "How to
program in Scheme" section.  Choose any of PLT DrScheme, PLT MzScheme, or
PLT Miscellaneous Libraries.

 Hi Richard,
 
 I'm finally ready to tackle this one if you have some time to help.

 If I understand the current status:
 
  * Help Desk works fine when you run it from the command line.
 
  * Help Desk doesn't work if you try to start it within DrScheme.
 
 Is that right?
 
 If so, the next step is to get strace output for each case. In other
 words, run
 
   strace -odr drscheme
     ;; try to open Help Desk, then quit after it fails
 
   strace -ohd help-desk
     ;; quit after it start up
 
 and send me the "dr" and "hd" files.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Pretty much, yes.  Unfortunately, although I was able to recreate the
 problem quite consistently when I first discovered it, it now happens only
 intermittently.  If I can recreate the situation, I'll send you the strace
 output.
 
 Incidentally, this is my work address (which is where I noticed the bug).
 Would it break gnats if I sent updates to this problem from my home
 address?  I'll have more time to look at this there.

 Yeah.  Got it to reproduce this morning.

 They're attached.  I took the following actions to generate these traces:
 
 strace -odrscheme.trace drscheme
 click on Help menu
 click on Help Desk
 click on Manuals link
 click on PLT Miscellaneous Libraries: Reference Manual
 click OK or whatever in error message
 clock File menu in help-desk window
 select quit
 yes, I really want to quit.
 
 strace -ohelpdesk.trace help-desk
 same basic actions, although omit the initial steps.
 
 Oddly enough, as I was going through the steps again to get the above
 procedures down, I found some additional behavior.  The first time I
 clicked on the ref manual link, I got the error message under discussion.
 Subsequent clicks, however, worked correctly.  I wasn't running under
 strace at that point, so the attached files don't contain this.  If a trace
 of these repeated attempts would be helpful, let me know.
 
 Richard

 <awk> Sorry for that 1M+ coredump.  I forgot to compress the stupid things.
 Still, I'm doing good to remember to attach the files in the first place!
 
 I'm not sure if this is just a peculiarity of how I've got VM configured to
 display attachments, but it just kinda dumps them into the same buffer as
 the message text, with no indication of where one stops and the next
 starts.  If you have the same problem; holler -- I can resend the
 compressed versions.
 
 Sheepishly,
 
 Richard

 I belive I have found the bug in MzScheme. It's completely obvious,
 although it takes an interesting coincidence to produce the results
 you've seen.
 
 The bug is in do_open_output_file:
 
   char mode[2];
 
   mode[0] = 'w';
   mode[1] = 'b';
 
   /* ... change mode[0] or mode[1], depending on the
          mode specified by the programmer ... */
 
   fopen(filename, mode);
 
 The problem, of course, is that the `mode' string isn't
 null-terminated. So if your stack happens to have the right junk in it,
 and if fopen() happens to parse the mode string in such a way that the
 garbage appears to be meaningful, bad things can happen.
 
 I suspect that we never saw the problem before due to the way `mode'
 was parsed in the various versions of various OSes. Or maybe switching
 to gcc 2.95.x on x86 made the stack more likely to contain something
 meaningful to the mode parser in fopen().
 
 Anyway, fixed for the next release.
 
 Thanks for the system traces, Richard.
 
 Matthew
