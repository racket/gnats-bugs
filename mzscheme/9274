>Description:
I've just svn co'd trunk, and run a build thusly:
cd plt/src/build
PREFIX=$HOME/bin/plt
X11BASE=$PREFIX
CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -g" #-Werror-implicit-function-declaration 
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -DLONG64"
LIBTOOL=/usr/local/bin/libtool

../configure --prefix=${PREFIX} --enable-shared --enable-xft --enable-gl \
            --enable-xrender --enable-cairo --with-x --enable-pthread \
            --enable-lt=${LIBTOOL} \
            --x-includes=${X11BASE}/include --x-libraries=${X11BASE}/lib \
            CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS}" \
            CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS}" \
            --mandir=$PREFIX amd64-portbld-freebsd7.0

Unfortunately, it stopped here:

env XFORM_USE_PRECOMP=xsrc/precomp.h ../mzschemecgc -cqu ../../../mzscheme/gc2/xform.ss --setup . --cpp "gcc -E -I/usr/local/include -DLONG64 -D_THREAD_SAFE   -DNEWGC_BTC_ACCOUNT -DNO_GC_SIGNALS  -DASSUME_FIXED_STACK_SIZE -DFIXED_STACK_SIZE=1048576 -DDONT_ITIMER -DMZ_USES_SHARED_LIB -I./.. -I../../../mzscheme/gc2/../include" -o xsrc/number.c ../../../mzscheme/gc2/../src/number.c
Error [GCING] 780 in ../../../mzscheme/gc2/../src/number.c: Function scheme_is_integer declared __xform_nongcing__, but includes a function call.
xform: Errors converting
gmake[4]: *** [xsrc/number.c] Error 1
gmake[4]: Leaving directory `/usr/home/andrew/plt-svn/plt/src/build/mzscheme/gc2'

I don't know enough about xform to know what it's looking for.  I had a look at number.c, and if the things that look like macros (all caps) are macros, then that leaves the call to floor() as the problem.  Is it a problem?

Cheers,

 My guess is that something that's usually a function turns out to be a
 macro on your system, and xform doesn't recognize something in the
 expansion of the macro.
 
 Can you send me the preprocessed version of "number.c"? The "gcc -E
 ..." fragment above has all the command-line flags you need to get it
 manually.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I've added __isinfl() as a recognized non-GCing primitive. (Yes, it
 would be better if these things were not hard-wired into the 3m xform.)
 I think that will fix the build problem.
 
 To continue with your existing check-out and build, manually delete
 "<builddir>/mzscheme/gc2/xform-collects".
