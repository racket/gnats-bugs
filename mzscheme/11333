The names (such as "[:lower:]") of the pregexp <posix> grammar elements do not match up with their descriptions (such as "Contains space, tab, and ASCII ink users").  Some of the mismatches are obvious; it is possible others are transposed (e.g. "[:blank:]" and "[:space:]").

 The only problem I've seen is that [:print:] had the [:upper:]
 description, and the right one was put by mistake on [:lower:].  Both
 fixed now.  I also put them in a more logical order.

 These look fine to me.
