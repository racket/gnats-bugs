>Description:
See simple tests below for the failure, where the results should have
meaningful names.  I think that the two are different -- I started
tracking the second when I saw that the first happens too.

The first one happens around line 1268 of "foreign.rktc", this is
after a commit that I'll push soon, so the line number might be off --
it's the only line that has this:

    return scheme_make_foreign_external_cpointer(*(void **)W_OFFSET(src, delta));

The conversion to a pointer loses the name.  (This code is from commit
c49b22fa, "change _pointer to mean a reference to non-GCed memory;
add _gcpointer".

-> (get-ffi-obj 'getpid #f (_fun -> _int))
#<procedure:ffi:proc>
-> (get-ffi-obj 'getpid #f (_fun [x : (_ptr i _int)] -> _int))
#<procedure>

 The information is lost in the call to
 scheme_make_foreign_external_cpointer(), which is now line #1322 of
 "foreign.rktc".
