>Description:
argv is always empty when executing a scheme executable created with "Scheme->Create Executable".

Sorry, I'm behind a firewall and cannot send a bug report via Help Desk :(
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute it with "mzscheme -r argv.scm hi there" which works as expected.
Now go to Scheme->Create Executable and save as argv.exe.  When executing "argv.exe hi there" I get
#()

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
