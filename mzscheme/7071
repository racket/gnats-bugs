>Description:
One of my students posted the following to our discussion
board this morning.  I have had similar problems (if I leave 
DrS open all night, I have to restart it in the morning due
to excessive GC when I try to edit or execute -- I am also on XP).

"After having Dr. Scheme open for about 9 hours today, I 
noticed it and my system (XP Pro) were going pretty slow. 
Looking in the Task Manager, I saw Dr. Scheme was using 
192MB of RAM. I saved, closed, restarted Dr. Scheme, loaded
 my project, and ran it once. Even after all that it used 
only 66MB of RAM. For all of Dr. Scheme's garbage collection,
 something sure leaked somewhere, a LOT."
>How-To-Repeat:
No particular programs seem to cause the problem.  Doesn't
happen all the time, but I'd estimate about 80% of the time.

 This sounds like our known problem with conservative collection...
