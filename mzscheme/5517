 This bug is fixed in v200. It's a problem with the stack-limit
 calculation in the case that the OS does not limit the stack size.
 
 Setting the stack limit (e.g., `limit stack 8129' in csh) before
 running DrScheme avoids the crash, but a better option is to upgrade to
 v200. An alpha version is available from the web site, and a final
 version will be available in a couple of days.
