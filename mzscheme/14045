>Description:
Under Linux or Mac, using ffi/unsafe to call some function from shared library cause:

SIGCHLD handler called (some thread has SIGCHLD unblocked)

And after that message, DrRacket because unstable (may crash).

The shared library function does start it's own subprocesses.

According to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/racket-users/L2P9s4-PO_E, I believe Racket isn't playing nicely enough with the other libraries. FFI calls (no actuall C code other than straight-forward get-ffi-obj) should support whatever correct shared library by themself. If needed I can look into the shared library and provide details on it's usage of subprocesses.
