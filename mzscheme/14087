>Description:
I have the following program that is not producing the right value, likely because of some corruption dering expansion/serialization. 

This program outputs (#hash((1 . (2 . 11)))) for me instead of the expected (#hash((1 . 2))) which it does if I don't raco make.

The 11 is larger if the program is larger, which is one of the reasons that I suspect corruption.
>How-To-Repeat:
With this in tmp.rkt
#lang racket/base
(require (for-syntax racket/base))

(with-syntax ([a #'(#hash((1 . 2)))])
  (eval-syntax
    (syntax 
      (begin-for-syntax
        (displayln (syntax->datum #'a)))
      )))

raco make tmp.rkt && racket tmp.rkt
Just racket tmp.rkt doesn't show the behavior.

 Does the output of raco decompile show anything out of the ordinary?
