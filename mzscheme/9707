>Description:
After upgrading to DrScheme 4.1, I noticed that the "time" function is unable to measure the running time of the "expt" function. Instead of returning the currect running time (which, for the expression below, is about 5 seconds), it displays 0 for cpu/real/gc time. This problem was not present in 372.
>How-To-Repeat:
Bug in 4.1:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1 [3m].
Language: Pretty Big custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
> (time (= 0 (expt 325361 545187)))
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
#f

Correct behavior in 372:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 372 [3m].
Language: Pretty Big (includes MrEd and Advanced Student) custom; memory limit: 384 megabytes.
> (time (= 0 (expt 325361 545187)))
cpu time: 5693 real time: 5852 gc time: 69
false

 A clarification: this happens only when the debugger is disabled  
 (Dynamic Properties: No debugging or profiling). 372 and 4.1 were  
 tested with the same language settings.

 The same behavior is observed in 4.0 and 4.0.2.

 `time' measures how long it takes to run the code --- but not how long
 it takes to compile.
 
 In your test, I think the compiler is constant-folding `(expt 325361
 545187)', and then also folding `(= 0 <some-big-number>)' to `#f', so
 that the executed program is closer to
 
  (time #t)
 
 A difference between v372 and v4.1 is that `expt' is bound in a
 different way that enables constant folding in v4.1. Specifically,
 `expt' is initially bound as an import in v4.1, whereas in v372, `expt'
 was initially bound as a top-level variable whose value is initialized
 to the usual `expt' function. The v4.1-style import binding enables
 constant folding, because the compiler knows that the imported binding
 never changes.
 
 Also, I think you must have debugging disabled in DrScheme, right?
 Debugging instrumentation obscures the expression enough that the
 compiler cannot fold constants.
