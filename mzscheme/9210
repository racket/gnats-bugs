>Description:
On Windows XP, when I try to copy code from a text editor into the command line version of mzscheme (version 352), I get some very odd behavior.

When I try to insert function definitions, mzscheme complains about an undefined variable M when I run the function. If I instead paste in a quoted list, I see an M appear somewhere in the list.

This seems to happen only with forms that span multiple lines, and the exact location of the M varies with the indentation of lines and the location of the closing parenthesis. The presence of the M also seems to vary based on whether the newline at the end of input is pasted in from the clipboard or entered into the command line explicitly.
>How-To-Repeat:
This gets a little hard to read because some input is being pasted from clipboard and some is typed into the command line. I'll try to show exactly what input is comming from where on comments before each input line. (Note that where I put "\n" there may have actually been "\n\r", I don't really know.)

The text from the clipboard is coming from notepad, but I get identical results with other editors (e.g. DrScheme).

 Just for posterity, this was just re-confirmed on Windows XP pro
 version 2002 sp2 by Stephen Chang.

 I was also able to reproduce the bug on a machine with Windows 7 ultimate, sp1.
