remove* doesn't seem to fit its documentation, or indeed do much useful.
The documentation reads

  (remove* item list [equal?]) PROCEDURE 

  Like remove, but all instances of item are removed, instead of just the first one. 

but the code for it is

   (define remove* 
     (polymorphic
      (case-lambda
       [(l r equal?)
	(if (null? l)
	    r
	    (remove* (cdr l) (remove (car l) r equal?)))]
       [(l r) (remove* l r equal?)])))

so it's really taking a list of arguments (l) and removing the first
instance of each element of l from r.

build.
