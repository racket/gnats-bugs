>Description:

In order for mzscheme to be "safe", it must report all primitive errors as
soon as they occur, and here it is apparantely letting format report an
error for `error'.

>How-To-Repeat:

[new-world] ~/311/hw5> mzscheme -q
Welcome to MzScheme version 47, Copyright (c) 1995-96 Matthew Flatt
> (error 'hi "~a" 1 2)
format: format string requires 2 arguments, given 3; args: "~s: ~a" hi 1 2

>Fix:

Probably this can be fixed by calling format twice, or using string-append
and then format or something.
