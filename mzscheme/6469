>Description:
It should be possible to have an ellipses in the middle
of a pattern, as long as there is only one ellipses, just
like ,@ is allowed in the middle of the list.

For example, with this pattern:

  (a b x ... p q)

matches this:

  (a b x x x p q)

with three things in the x. I don't tihnk that
there can be any ambiguity.

 I remember wanting this too, and wondering why syntax-case hadn't
 defined it.  One reason is that Eugene didn't in his original system,
 but that isn't the sort of thing to hold back Kent.  The only problem
 is it makes the matcher *slightly* more work to write, though not so
 much that this is a significant cost or that it affects macros that
 don't use it.  (It doesn't require bottom-up parsing, say.)
 
 Matthew?
