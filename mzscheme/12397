>Description:
The 'mixin' form gets confused by interfaces that contain names defined with 'define-local-member-name'.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define-local-member-name f)

(define f<%>
  (interface ()
    f))

(define f-mixin
  (mixin (f<%>) ()
    (super-new)
    (define/override (f x)
      0)))

=> mixin: method `f' was referenced in definition, but is not in any of the from-interfaces: '(#<|interface:f<%>|>)

There should be no error, because f is from f<%>, which appears in the mixin's domain interfaces.
