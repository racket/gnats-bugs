>Description:
Create standalone executable/distribution from menu in DrRacket version 5.2.0.6 produces incorrect distribution -- the executable fails with error message "failed to start /bin/gracket (No such file or directory)", which seems to indicate an incorrect path. This is a showstopper.

(Was this perhaps introduced with the places distribution fix?)

Workaround: manual distribution/compilation or source code distribution
>How-To-Repeat:
; 1. copy and paste the following program:
#lang racket/gui

(define (test)
  (send (new frame%
             (label "Hello world")
             (width 200)
             (height 200)) show #t))
    
(void (test))

; 2. Choose Racket>Create Executable... with options distribution and Gracket and save the distribution (as, say, "test")
; 3. Unpack the distribution and launch the executable in bin/test
; ==> the executable does not start

 FWIW, this works under mac os x lion (which means a 64 bit build I believe).

Reason>>> Fixed by commit 26c0ef9.

Yes, it was related to fix for places. It's also another
case of not running enough test suites after that
change.
