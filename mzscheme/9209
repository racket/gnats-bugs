>Description:
There are new stand-alone releases of libffi (http://sourceware.org/libffi).  For Fedora, we will be patching mzscheme to link with the the system libffi instead of using the bundled version.  Our patch is pretty hacky.  It would be nice if you could provide a configure option to build and link against the system libffi (which likely includes improvements, such as SELinux-related fixes).

 It looks like Fedora never ended up doing this or have since dropped such a
 patch.

 But I do agree that it'd be nice to be able to use the system libffi.  Is
 there a chance of that happening?

 Yes, there's a plan to do that in the very near future.
 
 (BTW, sending an email to `bugs' makes it show up only in the bug, so
 almost nobody sees it...)
