>Description:
The second example in Guide: PLT Scheme, Section 4.8.1 is wrong, the only condition of
cond should be

    (positive? height)

instead of 

    (not (positive? height)

Use the second condition, you can't get any output from console.

 Sorry I thought we used only running code in these documents.

 Given our scribble infrastructure, does it make sense to use the
 impetus of these bug reports to turn each of these examples into
 running code at least enough to catch these bugs?

 It is running code, and the typeset answer matches the code. The
 example doesn't show what the prose intends, though.

 Yes, I recognized that. I wanted to tell Robby that this is NOT an  
 issue of running code, just like the mistakes in 3 and 4 of II in  
 Redex aren't issues of running code either. The prose has to have  
 something to do with the code, and I don't know how to program that.

 Talk about jumping to conclusions!!!!
 
 The code _IS_ wrong! The English text was right!

 But that isn't even the point we're talking about. We're talking about
 
   (1) making sure that code and results are in sync
   (2) making sure that code/results and prose are in sync
 
 In both points, "in sync" means that both can be off. If you automate  
 the code/results connection -- which is what your first email seems  
 to ask for -- you can eliminate problem 1. Problem 2 remains; as I  
 said, just like with tests:
   -- the code could be wrong
   -- the prose could be wrong
   -- both could be wrong
 I didn't preclude any of these there. All I said is that they have to  
 be in sync and I don't know how to program that.

 ...? I seem to recall starting this conversation with a particular
 point in mind. What you write below doesn't even seem particularly
 relevant to the bug report at hand. Its relevant in some very abstract
 general sense, but that's all.
 
 And, of course I agree with it. I didn't disagree the first time you
 brought it up either! (I did misunderstand you last time, but once I
 understood what you meant, I agreed.)
 
 I'm trying to say that the code snippets can come with checks. (I've
 said this before, too.) Things like "there should be output" or "there
 should be no error" or something like that. I see I wrote this badly
 in my initial message, tho. Apologies.
