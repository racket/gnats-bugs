>Description:
If I write to a file with (fprintf port ... ), then I lose the last
line, unless I 

1) make sure the file ends in a newline, or

2) I close the file with close-output-port.  

I say this is a documentation error, because the MzScheme manual does
not explain what t-y-scheme says:

      After you have performed I/O on a port, you should close it with
      close-input-port or close-output-port.

Now Matthew Flatt says this is explained in the MzScheme manual, and
he wrote, "I certainly don't claim that it's obvious."  I disagree
with Matthew, as section 11.2.2 "Writing" of the MzScheme manual reads

(fprintf output-port format-string ...) prints formatted output to
output-port, [...]

The only reasonable explanation of this is that the file is written to
as soon as this fprintf command is executed, and apparently this isn't
the case.  So I recommend that section 11.2.2 end with a sentence like

      After writing to a file with (fprintf port ... ), you should
      close the port with (close-output-port port ...).

I'm confused that there's not actually any mention of
"close-output-port" in the MzScheme manual.  I see this by searching
in Help Desk for "close-output-port":

   Searched in manuals related to the language "Pretty Big (includes
MrEd and Advanced)" for "close-output-port"

   Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days
   close-output-port in "t-y-scheme"

   Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
   (close-output-port port) in "Ports"


Note that the (below-standard) standard R5RS only says

procedure:  (close-output-port port)

Closes the file associated with port, rendering the port incapable of
delivering or accepting characters. These routines have no effect if
the file has already been closed. The value returned is unspecified.

One wouldn't guess that the port would have to be closed in order for
a write to take place.

Now Matthew is a *much* better at MzScheme than I am, so maybe what I
really disagree with Matthew is how clear the documentation should be.
But I don't believe that, because I learned about documentation errors
from Richard Stallman, who Matthew also holds in high esteem.  

>How-To-Repeat:
drscheme &

Paste these 3 lines of code into Untitled window and execute:

(define porty (open-output-file "busted-newline"))

(fprintf porty "here's one line, which we'll get~n")

(fprintf porty "no newline here")


The file busted-newline contains the first line but not the second. 

I can fix this problem in two ways:  Either add another line of code

(close-output-port porty)

or add a newline to the last fprint command, i.e.

(fprintf porty "no newline here~n")

 Thanks for summarizing the problem.  Now that it is clear to me that
 this is just a matter of documentation I can deal with it.  The thing
 is, you said what you think is missing, but not where.  I don't think
 that fprintf is the right place because the same issue applies for any
 kind of output, including things like:
 
   (display "here's one line, which we'll get\nno newline here" porty)
 
 Is there a place where this can/should be mentioned?

 Great, Eli!
 
    The thing is, you said what you think is missing, but not where.  
 
 Good point.  I guess it goes like this: 
 
 Real schemers will understand that an output port isn't a file, and so
 executing an fprintf command doesn't necessarily cause the output to
 be written to a file right then.  Nothing in R5RS or t-y-scheme or the
 MzScheme manual says otherwise.  I couldn't find anything that said
 that *any* file writing *ever* had to take place!
 
 But no novice would understand that.  There ought to be a place in the
 documentation where it's explained to novices how to write to files:
 
 When does the file write take place?  It's not when the fprint is
 executed.  Is it when the close-output-port is executed?  When does an
 fprintf command not result in a file write ever taking place?  Suppose
 your program writes some data to a file, and later on reads that data
 from the same file.  Must you close the port after writing, and then
 re-open the port to read it?  T-y-scheme doesn't say enough, IMO.
 
    I don't think that fprintf is the right place because the same
    issue applies for any kind of output, including things like:
 
      (display "here's one line, which we'll get\nno newline here" porty)
 
 That's a good point.  That didn't seem to work for me, but this did:
 
 (define porty (open-output-file "busted-newline"))
 (display "here's one line, which we'll get\n" porty)
 (display "no newline here" porty)
 ;same fix:
 ;(close-output-port porty)
