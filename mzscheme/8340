I don't think this is something that would have changed, so it looks like a break?

(require (lib "pregexp.ss"))
(define test
  (let ([reg (pregexp "(?:\".*?\"|'.*?'|[^[:space:]\"']+)")])
    '...))

This compiles and executes in v352. In version 352.7 (which, according to Noel Welsh, "all the cool kids are using"), this does not compile.

If Noel jumped off a bridge, I would too.

So, anyway... I'll roll back to something less cutting edge for a moment...

 [`pregexp' is now all in the mzscheme core.  The pregexp library is
 kept for compatibility, but it just reprovides the core stuff.]
 
 It looks like character classes are problematic -- a simpler
 expression:
 
   #px"[^[:space:]]"

 Yes, I forgot to implement Posix character classes for character
 patterns (as opposed to byte patterns), and I also overlooked it in the
 test suite.
 
 I've fixed this, and I should be able to merge to the trunk later
 today. Meanwhile, if you're processing ASCII, you can avoid the bug by
 using `byte-pregexp', instead.
