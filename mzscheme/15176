>Description:
With some nested if, the sfs phase doesn't clear the variables. This doesn't cause an error, but it may make some program run out of memory.

For example, in the first example long-vector is not cleared before the call to make-vector.

Swaping the branches fix the problem, so the second example is ok.


The the 3rd and 4th examples also have problems, but I guess it's a diferent problem.

In all cases, make-vector can be replaced with any similar function, like make-string 
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(lambda (false long-vector proc)
  (list
   (if false
     (if (random) 7 (length long-vector))
     'long-vector-not-cleared-here)
   (proc (make-vector 1000))))

(lambda (false long-vector proc)
  (list
   (if false
     'but-it-is-cleared-here
     (if (random) 7 (length long-vector)))
   (proc (make-vector 1000))))
