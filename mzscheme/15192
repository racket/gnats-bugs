After upgrading to Racket 6.3
(tcp-listen 1234) now listens only 127.0.0.1

(tcp-listen 1234 4 #f #f) the same

I looked into documentation, but there still #f means "all interfaces"

(tcp-accept (tcp-listen 1234))

Then with command "netstat -a -n" one may see:
  TCP    127.0.0.1:1234         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING

 I've noticed a similar problem, and I think this may be an issue
 related to building v6.3 with MinGW instead of MSVC. It's on my list
 for today.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 29 Nov 2015 19:43:57 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed by commit 817fdad2d50.

Unfortunately, I don't have a good workaround for the v6.3
release build, but the repair will be included in the next
snapshot build.
