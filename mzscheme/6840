>Description:
the bcc32 / tasm32 and tasm52 builds of both the dll and "monilithic"
versions run to here..............

112480 (atomic) + 255656 (composite) collectable bytes in use
Finalize + initiate sweep took 0 + 2 msecs
Increasing heap size by 139264 after 10212 allocated bytes

..................................

then they crash.
Observe, regardless of compiler switching

Tasm32r / 52 does not contain any codeflow generation bugs, as far as I've
seen during approximately 20,000 builds with Bcc32 over the T assemblers.

Suspect that GC clashes with the TLS (thread local storage with full callback) that Bcc32 5.5.1 and up use as standard, essentially is redundant for bcc32's said model.

I made several builds of GC.dll's with bcc32 / tasm for other non open src
RT crippled builds, mostly VC++, and one case lcc, that rendered the 
applications hyperstable almost, but never tried to use GC on a Bcc32 build
before due to its always present, very complete RT handling.

Have anyone succeeded in a bc32 build ?
VC++ is no option as of masm32 mnemonics used in the C(++)compiler
not more than a fractal bug generator, nice if one want to play code lotto,
or to generate poor coding standards.

Reason>>> mzscheme

State changed from "open" to "suspended" by mflatt at Fri, 28 Jan 2005 11:15:34 -0500
Reason>>> For various reasons --- including that Microsoft now provides
a free compiler --- we have decided to gve up on BCC support
for now. We'd happily accept patches from others, however, if anyone
decides to maintain BCC support.

Thanks,
