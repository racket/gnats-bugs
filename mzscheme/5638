 Needs more thought, but it's a little better now:
 
  read: expected a closing '"'; newline within string suggests a missing
  '"' on line 4
 
 I don't like the single quotes that quote the double quotes, though.
 Any suggestions for an alternate delimitter?

 DrScheme seems to presuppose the use of a color screen ...
