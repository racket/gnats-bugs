>Description:
Running my program an then hitting break tried to put weird
values into the continuation - sometimes.  Here are two
of the strange errors:
> (f)
user break
add1: expects 1 argument, given 0
> 

> (f)
user break
add1: expects argument of type <number>; given #<primitive:add1>
> 

This appears to be reproducable, at least in a probablistic
sense (assuming you have a lot of memory).
>How-To-Repeat:
In the def's window define
   (define (f) (add1 (f)))
Then click Execute.
In the repl, call (f).
Wait until about 3-5 hundred Mb are allocated.  Then hit break
and wait a second or two.

The first time, when I was impatient, I used kill instead of break
(or I killed during the breaking process).  That time DrScheme segfaulted
with a core dump a few minutes later during a really long GC.  I
can't reproduce that one, though.  It may be related to this bug.

Thanks.

 I haven't been able to reproduce the problem on an x86 FreeBSD machine,
 and I suspect that the bug occurs only on a register-rich machine like
 the Sparc.
 
 Can you try reproducing the bug on an x86 machine, in case I'm wrong?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 One more question: is it specific to 101, or does it happen in version
 100 as well? (I suspect the latter.)
 
 Thanks again,
 Matthew

 On my laptop, which has 64Mb, I could not reproduce
 Paul G.'s bugs.  I allowed the evaluation to run until
 I got the error "Running low on virtual memory".
 This was with 101.
 
 I did experience one problem, where the Break
 button had no effect, seemingly.  I had to kill
 DrScheme using the NT Task Manager.
