>Description:
When I enter a REPL and try to turn on R5RS compliance, I run:

> #lang r5rs

However, it hangs and doesn't do anything. It's not spinning the processor. It just appears to be waiting for something. However if I use #lang r5rs as part of a script, it works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang r5rs

Reason>>> DrRacket now tells you that "#lang"
isn't meant to be used in the REPL
