>Description:
An infinite recursion causes DrScheme to exit entirely, with mred out of
memory.  This is unacceptable in a system intended for use by beginning
students.  Instead the computation should be aborted, freeing up the
memory, and a message then printed within DrScheme about having run
out of memory.
>How-To-Repeat:
(let f () (+ (f) 1))
>Fix:
