>Description:
Seemingly randomly, DrScheme will crash on me, leaving only the message "Profiling timer expired drscheme" on the terminal from which I started it.  The only correlation I can find is that it seems to only happen when I click on something (though what the something is is indeterminate).  Time doesn't seem to make a difference, this can happen after a few minutes or a few hours.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION:

Install a signal handler to catch & ignore SIGPROF.  (Why would DrScheme be receiving this anyway?)

 DrScheme uses the profiling timer to trigger thread swaps internally.
 The signal should be caught.
 
 You're not building with --enable-ptherads or something that might
 create OS-level threads that don't want a SIGPROF, right? That's the
 only idea I have offhand...

 I'm using Debian's 4.1.4-1 binary from the plt-scheme package.  So,
 I'm not sure but I don't think so.  Looking through
 http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/plt-scheme.html doesn't seem to
 indicate that they do.

 It would be good to try a build from Source.  The Debian packaging has
 had several issues in the past.

 Also, FWIW, building from source is very easy .... once you have all
 of the required header packages installed, which can be a bit of a
 pain.

 Where's the irony?  This is helpful in eliminating the possibility of
 weird patches that the debian package might introduce (and assuming
 that you did a straight `../configure; make'), and it's even
 happenning in MzScheme rather than in the GUI, which is probably
 making it even easier to find.
