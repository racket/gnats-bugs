>Description:
This problem occurs under FreeBSD as well.  When I try to compile the
embedding example (found in the mzscheme internals doc;
http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/doc/insidemz/node6.htm), 
I get the following link errors (compile command is there as well):

[knotwell@knotwell plt]$ gcc -I./collects/mzscheme/include/ -L./collects/mzscheme/lib/i386-linux -lmzscheme -lgc j.c
/tmp/ccl1x99v.o: In function `main':
/tmp/ccl1x99v.o(.text+0x7): undefined reference to `scheme_basic_env'
/tmp/ccl1x99v.o(.text+0x11): undefined reference to `scheme_current_process'
/tmp/ccl1x99v.o(.text+0x37): undefined reference to `scheme_current_process'

/tmp/ccl1x99v.o(.text+0x9a): undefined reference to `scheme_display'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
[knotwell@knotwell plt]$ 

I find this error especially curious because scheme_basic_env shows up in
nm -a output for libmzscheme.a.  I suppose this could be a linker bug, but 
it's found across multiple operating systems and other programs link
correctly.

If I've just done something stupid, I'm sorry to have wasted your time.



>How-To-Repeat:
1) install PLT scheme on FreeBSD (3.3) or Linux (RH6.1)
2) create a file with the example inside it
3) attempt to compile the example
