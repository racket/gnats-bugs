>Description:
In the documentation for class.ss, the rule for 'init-field' is:

class-clause is one of
...
(init-field field-declaration ...)
...

And the rule for 'field declaration' is this:

field-declaration is
  (variable default-value-expr)

However, as Robby points out, the elements of an 'init-field' do
not require default-value-exprs.  It seems that the rule for 
'init-field' should actually be:

...
(init-field init-declaration ...)
...
