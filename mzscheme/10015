 This continues to be the case with current Racket, but the files all
 go in the tmp directory.

 This files are expected, and there is no way to avoid them.  They contain
 "trampoline" HTML files that have an HTML fragment or query since those are
 not passed on to the browser when used on Windows.  There are now similar
 problems with some of the newer Linux browser launchers, so it is likely to
 be used there too.  The reason for leaving them behind is that there is no
 way to know when the browser actually opened and jumped to the correct
 place.  To make things semi-sane, every time the send-url function is used
 it will delete some of the older files, so they should stay at some
 smallish number of files overall.  Also, they should all be in the temp
 directory, so if they got elsewhere then that's a real bug.

 The files are reported to be in the correct place, so I'm closing this bug.
 
 Also, what are the issues on linux?

 There is no issue on Linux now -- I'm just noting that a similar hack will
 eventually be done there too, with the same result of these temporary files
 appearing (but only for browser launchers that need it).

 Right, I'm wondering what browsers need it, and why.

 If you look in the send-url file, it's the one that was commented last, I
 think that Ryan reported the problem.  Maybe the XDG one.

 My current version of xdg-open works properly for this:
 
 $ xdg-open http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/search/index.html?q=foo
 [... firefox opens with the appropriate query ...]
 
 So this should probably be added back.

 Try it with a file:// URL.  Also, it might be a fragment that is the
 problem.

 The version of xdg-open that I have fails on "file:" URLs with query 
 components, which is what "raco docs" used.

 Ah yes, it does have that behavior for me too.

 If either of you know of some way to get it to work, I would love to
 hear it.  (I really don't like the trampoline hack, and doing that on
 linux just sounds wrong... but I don't see any other way to resolve
 it.)

 One solution that occurs to me is to use a different way to
 communicate the search query to the page.  For example:
 
 file:///blah/search.html#query/foo
 
 which is how gmail works, currently, and which is passed correctly by
 xdg-open.  Might be worth testing on IE to see if it works there too.
 
 You would then extract the query using JS with 'window.location.hash'

 I considered that in the past, and it's bad for several reasons:
 * first, IIRC, on windows it's the fragment that gets lost so making
   both work will make some fragile solution that will often break on
   one;
 * second, it makes the tool work only on pages that are prepared for
   it, and net/sendurl should be usable with other pages too;
 * finally, it makes it depend on JS to get things to work -- and
   that's an even bigger problem in the documentation pages case, since
   running off of a file:// makes for a lot more JS problems (since
   it's often much more restricted, especially on windows).

 We're already in trouble for this, right?  `send-url' won't work on
 windows with fragments, can't use xdg-open with query parameters for
 file urls, etc.
 
 Anyway, I'm not suggesting that we should change `send-url' for other
 clients, just suggesting that we use a different query mechanism to
 make our own docs work better.

 I don't understand this -- search already requires JS to do anything.

 It does work on windows -- by making up these temporary trampoline
 files.  It doesn't work on xdg-open now, but will when I do the same
 hack there too.  (And only for browsers like xdg-open that require
 it.)

 It's also used to jump to a known definition url, where no JS is
 involved.  (But yes, if xdg-open ignores the query part then this
 point doesn't apply there.)

 Does it currently check if the URL requires the trampoline?

 Unfortunately, xdg-open is worse than that -- it errors and produces
 nothing useful if you use a query part.

 Yes, it only uses that when the url matches #rx"[?#]", see the
 `send-url/win' function for the wonderful implementation.  There's
 also a big comment before that with a description of the problem and
 some of the other (failing) solutions.
 
 And now that I looked at it, windows is not passing either one, no
 query and no fragment.
 
 (Also, the code will delete the temporary files after 15 seconds, if
 the thread that does that is allowed to live that long, and files
 older than 15 minutes are removed otherwise with a random to avoid
 doing it on every call...)
