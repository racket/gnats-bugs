>Description:
The "subprocess" function requires its first argument (and possibly second and third) to satisfy file-stream-port?; its documented contract is output-port?, which does not include the file-stream-port? check.  The related functions system, system*, process, process*, process/ports, and process*/ports may have similar errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
Call subprocess with ports created by make-pipe. This error was generated on a PPC running Mac OS X 10.5.4.
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 08 Jan 2010 09:06:47 -0500
Reason>>> someone fixed the docs
