>Description:
I'm writing a library with several large units, several of which share a small 
overlap in the exported interface. In some cases I would like to combine these 
signatures as in:

(require (lib "unitsig.ss"))

(define-signature ab^ (a b))
(define-signature bc^ (b c))
(define-signature abc^ ((open ab^) (open bc^)))

but this gives an error "define-signature: duplicate name in signature in: b". I 
can get around this by explicitly listing listing the signatures, but it would be
easier to maintain the signatures if I could avoid manually unioning the two 
signatures.
