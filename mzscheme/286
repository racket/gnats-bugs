DrScheme, Save As, select file on network, hit OK.

Get standard output window:

normalize-path: "\\\\Unix\\flanagan\\" (within the input path) is not a directory or does not exist.

But it does, and the file select dialog let me select it.

Also, no cut-and-paste from the stdout window.

 Can you make that windows locked instead of in a edit-sequence? (Sorry if
 you did earlier...)

State-Changed-Why:
The problem with \\Unix\flanagan\ is that Microsoft's stat() doesn't
recognize UNC "drive" names. ("UNC" is the \\machine\filesystem format.
stat() says that "c:\" is a directory, but not "\\machine\filesystem\".)

The solution was to use something besides stat() when the given
path looks like a UNC drive. (I use _findfirst().)
