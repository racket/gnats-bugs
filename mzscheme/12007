>Description:
gethostname fails on win64, generating the diagnostic
 ffi-call: ABI not implemented: 'stdcall

One solution would have mzlib/os.rkt reference mred/private/wx/win32/types.rkt to use that module's _wfun syntax.

Also, the FFI prototype for GetComputerNameExA looks wrong.  It should be _int _bytes (_ptr io _uint), not _int _bytes _cvector.  And the g.c.n. API already nul-terminates its return.  Probably some history in there.

Ironically, I found this while grepping the Racket source looking for cvector example usages.
>How-To-Repeat:
