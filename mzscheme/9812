Two things:

1. When the given directory is relative, it is resolved to where
   the mzscheme binary is, instead of (find-system-path 'orig-dir),
   this is documented, but surprsing.

2. The directory is added before the standard collects, but the
   description ("More collects at ...") makes it seem like it should
   be prepended.

 I don't agree that it's documented --- you have to assume that the
 paths are passed as-is to `find-library-collection-paths' --- and it
 does seem like the wrong behavior. I'll fix it.

 I'll try to clarify that.

 Oh --- it's "documented" in the help output. I still plan to change it.

 Do you think that `-X' should be relative to the executable or cwd?

 Yes, that's what I was referring to.  (And it was very easyto miss
 there.)
 
 As for the second item -- the thing that bit me was that I was just
 trying out `mzscheme -S `pwd`' (since someone had a problem with it,
 and I tried to reproduce it) when I was in my home directory.  It took
 me a minute to realize that the reason nothing is working is that I
 have a `scheme' directory in my home dir...  Maybe it's better to add
 also `+S'?  (I know that the flag namespace is expensive, but just the
 fact that there's a `+S' will make people less confused about `-S'.)

 In that case it seems to me that an executable-relative path makes
 more sense internally, but on the command line I'd still expect a
 currect-directory-relative path.  The general intuition is the same
 for filename completion -- unless there's a very clear reason for a
 specific root (as in `setup-plt -l'), my first assumption would be
 cwd-relative.
 
 [But I wouldn't even mind throwing an error for a non-absolute path in
 that case...  I don't think that there are uses of it that don't fall
 under "special" conditions where you're careful -- and probably run it
 from a script.]

 How about making `-S' always add to the end, instead of the beginning?

 Ugh, I see now that I made two stupid phrasing errors (again) in the
 report that made it indecipherable...  What I wanted to say that I'd
 prefer it if `-S' appended to end of the code, since that's what the
 --help output seems to be indicating; and that if there's a reason to
 keep it as it is now, then that help line should be fixed.
 
 In other words, what you're suggesting...
 
 (And the second mistake was that I confused "prepended" with
 "appended"...)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 07 Oct 2008 10:57:22 -0400
Reason>>> Changed in SVN: -S and -X use paths relative to cwd, and
-S adds to the end of the default collection paths instead
of the middle.
