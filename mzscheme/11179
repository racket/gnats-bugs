>Description:
To make life easier for my students (who are working in a Windows lab with DrScheme 4.2.4 installed, and no way to get DrRacket until December), I've been trying to prepare a ZIP file they can download that contains a complete DrRacket installation.  So I install DrRacket on the F: drive (which persists past reboots), download and install the picturing-programs teachpack, test everything, copy the "Application Data\Racket" folder to the F: drive, then zip the entire folder (including the application data), upload it, and download it to a different Windows machine.  I have a script that copies the application data back to where it belongs on the C: drive, so I run that.

As soon as I try to load picturing-programs.rkt (which is indeed where I expect it to be), I get the weird error message
"require: namespace mismatch; reference (phase 0) to a module "F:\Racket\collects\racket\private\kw.rkt" that is not available (phase level 0)"

 Are the file timestamps different in the version that comes out of the
 zip file?

 I'm still not sure what the problem was, but I seem to have solved the =
 problem by using 7Zip instead of WinZip.  Please close this bug item.

 I'll close it then.  In any case, I think that there used to be a time
 where some zip programs (maybe the old pkzip thing) would need to be
 told explicitly to preserve the times.  Perhaps this was the issue
 here too.  You can also try NSIS -- it has a convenient utility that
 turns a directory into a simple "installer".  (And it would definitely
 preserve the times.)
