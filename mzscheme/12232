>Description:
The documentation for identifier macros in the Racket Guide:

    http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/pattern-macros.html#(part._.Identifier_.Macros)


completely glosses over how it deals specially with set!.  For someone who has not encountered them before, the documentation there is confusing.

See:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Racket/comments/kps5h/i_dont_understand_syntaxidrules/

for an example of the kind of confusion.  The poster there naturally thinks that identifier macros can be used like this:

   (define-syntax :=
     (syntax-id-rules ()
       ((a := b) (set! a b))))

   (counter := 1)

After reading the Guide myself on this point, I can't tell him that he's reading it wrong: the documentation leads naturally to this incorrect conclusion.


Also, the example in the Guide refers to get-clock and put-clock!, which are not defined anywhere, making it difficult to experiment with the identifier macro.
