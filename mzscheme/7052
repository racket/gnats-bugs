Compiling drscheme from source fails, see message below.

Environment: Gentoo Linux 2.6.8.
GCC version 3.4.2 with compile flags: -march=athlon-xp -O2 -pipe
  (also see GCC specs file detail below).


Build fails with following messages:

Compile drscheme-208 Gentoo package, leading to messages above.

Gentoo package for drscheme does the following:

1. downloads http://download.plt-scheme.org/bundles/208/plt/plt-208-src-unix.tgz

2. unpacks it into directory /var/tmp/portage/drscheme-208

3. configures it with: --prefix=/usr/share/drscheme/

4. makes it

 I have not tried gcc 3.4.2. As far as I can tell, gcc 3.4.1 has an
 optimizer bug, and maybe it persists in 3.4.2.
 
 Please see
 
  http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-scheme/2004-August/006338.html
 
 I would be interested to hear what 3.4.2 produces for the program in
 that message. Or, if you can shed any further light on the problem, I'd
 very much appreciate it.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Matthew,
 
 I pasted the test program into a file and ran it with/without -O2 and 
 with/without inline. I get the same results as you reported under GCC 
 3.4.1.
 
 Should I simply compile without -O2 ?
 
 Thanks for your prompt response to this bug report!

 Ok - thanks for running that test.
 
 > Should I simply compile without -O2 ?
 
 That's one solution. Another solution is to run `configure' as
 
  env CFLAGS="-DDONT_INLINE_NZERO_TEST" configure ...
 
 This #ifdefs out the troublesome "inline" declaration.
