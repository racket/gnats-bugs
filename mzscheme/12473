>Description:
Perhaps as a side effect of parallel builds, `raco setup' does not appear to detect cycles among multiple modules.  It goes into deadlock, neither terminating nor consuming cpu cycles (according to `top').  The `raco make' command correctly detects cycles and terminates with an error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following in a temporary directory:

#!/bin/bash
mkdir bug-part-one
mkdir bug-part-two
raco link bug-part-one
raco link bug-part-two
echo "#lang racket (require bug-part-two)" > bug-part-one/main.rkt
echo "#lang racket (require bug-part-one)" > bug-part-two/main.rkt
raco setup bug-part-one bug-part-two
>Fix:
