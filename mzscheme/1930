>Description:
In the MZ scheme section entitled Embedded Units (section 7.2.4 ?) your
code reads

  (define model@
    (compound-unit/sig
      (import)
      (link (ARITHMETIC : arithmetic^ (arithmetic@))
            (CALCULUS : calculus^ (calculus@ (ARITHMETIC : simple-arithmetic^))))
            (GRAPHICS : graphics^ (graphics@))
            (GRAVITY : gravity^ (gravity@ ARITHMETIC GRAPHICS)))
      (export (unit GRAVITY))))

It should read

  (define model@
    (compound-unit/sig
      (import)
      (link (ARITHMETIC : arithmetic^ (arithmetic@))
            (CALCULUS : calculus^ (calculus@ (ARITHMETIC : simple-arithmetic^))))
            (GRAPHICS : graphics^ (graphics@))
            (GRAVITY : gravity^ (gravity@ ARITHMETIC CALCULUS GRAPHICS)))
      (export (unit GRAVITY))))

>How-To-Repeat:
read the manual, having a fair but not solid understanding of signatures.  Failing that, think like a computer.
