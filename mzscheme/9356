Computer Language: (("Module") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug/profile) (default) #()))
>Description:
The profiler doesn't work: profiling some programs immediately raises an error.

The problem seems to occur when a module being profiled contains phase-1 code but does not import core appropriate bindings for syntax.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the following program in the definitions buffer:

  #lang scheme/base
  (define-struct S (a) #:transparent)

Set the language to Module and enable profiling, then hit Run. DrScheme prints the following error:

require: namespace mismatch; reference (phase 1) to a module "/home/ryan/projects/fresh-plt/collects/scheme/private/kw.ss" that is not available (phase 0) in: #%app

If the line

  (require (for-syntax scheme/base))

is inserted, the error goes away.

I'm confused by the presense of "(phase 0)" in the error message.
