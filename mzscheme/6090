On both Windows and Solaris, current-milliseconds returns

 I don't understand. This is the intended behavior; why would it be
 incorrect?
 
 I note that forcing the number to be positive would halve the range of
 reported values. The alternative is to allocate bignums, which would
 double the range, but wouldn't eliminate the wrap-around.

 I'd say it's unexpected.  Granted, the documentation states the value is
 a fixnum, but also says that the value is based on a specific date or
 machine startup.  One might ask how negative time can have passed.
 
 The simplest fix, of course, is just to make the docs clearer.
