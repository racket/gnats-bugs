>Description:
Inside units, rebinding of keywords works for everything except the
define family.  This is inconsistent.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (invoke-open-unit      
    (unit (import) (export) (define lambda 3) (lambda () 3)))
apply: 3 (type <fixnum-integer>) not a procedure; args: () 3
> (invoke-open-unit
    (unit (import) (export) (define define 2) (define f 3)))
<void>
>Fix:
define is necessarily special. Within a unit body, all expressions are
first expanded far enough to determine whether they are definitions.
This is the same as the algortihm for embedded defines, which is
explicitly described in the documentation. The unit documentation will
be expanded.

The actual effect is far more confusing than the bug report suggests.
"Expanding far enough" is a somewhat complex topic. Worse still,
unit/sig is different - it expands every body expression fully before
constructing a unit (so it matters whether a syntactic form is a macro
or a primitive form).

For the usual reason that MzScheme's systex system is too weak, this
cannot be reasonably improved.
