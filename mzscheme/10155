>Description:
In order to XForm a C file, it must #include<escheme.h>.  However, unlike the 'compile-extension procedure from dynext/compile, 'xform from compiler/xform does not automatically include the PLT include directory in the list of pre-processor include directories it passes to the C pre-processor.  Therefore, one essentially *must* call xform as 

(xform #f (path->string c-file) (path->string x-form-file) (list (find-include-dir)))

using (find-include-dir) from the setup/dirs module.  It would be more convenient if this was done automatically by the xform procedure.  The following patch (against SVN head) implements this:
