>Description:
I need an environment with both scheme-report-environment and bitwise-and such as provided by the initial environment of MzScheme version 352.
Witness:

NormHardy:~ norm$ Scheme
Welcome to MzScheme version 352, Copyright (c) 2004-2006 PLT Scheme Inc.
> (list scheme-report-environment bitwise-and)
(#<procedure:scheme-report-environment> #<primitive:bitwise-and>)

It is true that bitwise-and is not specified in R5RS but neither is it incompatible with R5RS.
bitwise-and is in Racket and I would like to think that there is no technical obstacle to including it along with other functions in section 4.2.2.6 of http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html .
Its inclusion did not mean that MzScheme version 352 was non-compliant with R5RS.
In MzScheme scheme-report-environment produces an environment without bitwise-and but that is easily remedied as in the code at http://cap-lore.com/code/Scheme/reposIntro/fileVal .
That code, however, relies on an initial top level environment with both scheme-report-environment and bitwise-and.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is probably not a bug but a development request.
The code at http://cap-lore.com/code/Scheme/reposIntro/fileVal needs both.
When routine fileVal is called bitwise-and is missing.
It is necessary for this file: http://cap-lore.com/code/Scheme/repository/Do
to reside at path name: /Users/norm/cap-lore.com/code/Scheme/repository/Do .
Of course file names may be changed mutatis mutandis.

use #%require

 I think you’re looking for a way to use ‘bitwise-and’ in an R5RS program, run using Racket 6.1.1. Is this correct? 
 
 If so, you can use #%require to import bindings from racket. For instance:
 
 #lang r5rs
 
 (#%require (only racket/base bitwise-and))
 
 (display (scheme-report-environment 5))
 
 (display (bitwise-and 34 15))
 
 
 Is this what you’re looking for?
