>Description:
in the code below, if the second argument to
the syntax-case is replaced with the commented stuff,
the syntax-case doesn't match. 

It appears that the `if' being generated in this macro
comes from nowhere. It seems like it should have the
right annotation, but that annotation got lost.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define stx
  #'(define-syntax s
      (lambda (stx)
        (syntax-case stx ()
          (_
           123)))))

(define dtm
  (syntax-case (expand stx) ();; (if)
    [(define-syntaxes (s)
       (lambda (stx1)
         (let-values1 qqq
                      (let-values2 zzz
                                   (if rslt1
                                       (let-values3 yyy (#%datum . dtm))
                                       xxx)))))

 The problem is that `syntax-case' uses `module-identifier=?'.
 
 In the example, you wanted `module-transformer-identifier=?'.
 
 `syntax-case*' will let you specify `module-transformer-identifier=?'
 as the comparision procedure for literals.

 So, is it the case that Check Syntax should always
 module-transformer-identifier=? when it is traversing the text behind a
 define-syntax and always use module-identifier=? when it isn't? (That
 is my guess, anyway).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 Yes, that's right.
