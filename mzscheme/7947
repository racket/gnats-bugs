>Description:
Under WinXP, I can reliably cause mzscheme to seg fault
by running the pack function from (lib "pack.ss" "setup")
on particular directories. It prints out "MzTarring 
<directory>..." first, which makes me think that the 
problem is somewhere in the loop on setup/pack.ss:123-149
but I don't know what would be causing problems there.

The problem does not occur in v301 on Windows, nor does
it occur on Linux (I haven't checked Macs). I have one
report that it doesn't occur on Windows in v301.9 if
you've also got v301 installed, but I haven't tried that
myself and so I can't vouch for it.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Unpack the zip file that I've put online at

http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jacobm/problem.zip

It will create a directory called javascript/ with four
files.

2. Run the following:
C:\Documents and Settings\jacobm>mzscheme
Welcome to MzScheme version 301.9, Copyright (c) 2004-2006 PLT Scheme Inc.
> (require (lib "pack.ss" "setup")) (pack "myarchive.plt" "archive" (list "javascript/") null std-filter #t 'file #f #f)
> MzTarring javascript/...

3. See Windows pop up an error message saying that mzscheme.exe crashed.

Notes: I can't figure out what salient properties the 
four files in that archive have at all. I do know that 
if you remove any of them then the bug goes away, at 
least on my machine.

 Does the problem go away if you disable the JIT?
 
 Thanks,

 Nevermind -- I see what I didn't wrong with the example before, and I
 got it to crash. (Disabling the JIT does avoid the crash for me.) So,
 I'll look into this more.
 
 Thanks,

 I think this is fixed, now.
 
 Furthermore, this bug could have been the fugitive that has caused lots
 of JIT-related crashes. The problem was exactly the sort of thing that
 I was looking for: a failure to update the global runstack pointer from
 the runstack register before calling a function that might trigger a
 GC. The missing update was in the arithmetic slow path (i.e.,
 non-fixnum).
 
 Thanks very much for the bug report!

 Excellent! I'll let you know if I see new crashes.
 
 (I was doing float & rational arithmetic, but probably not bignums. I'm
 pretty sure my rationals didn't end up with big nums in them, but not
 positive.)

 Ditto! :)
