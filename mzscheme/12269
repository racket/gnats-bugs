 No, the docs for syntax/trusted-xforms are simply out of date (in 
 referring to syntax-recertify and scheme/class). The point is still the 
 same: it lists modules that must have a high-privilege code inspector 
 associated with their declaration. The difference is now that code 
 inspector is used for syntax-disarm, not syntax-recertify.
 
 I'll treat this as a documentation bug.
