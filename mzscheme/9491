>Description:
I was following the tutorial "More: Systems Programming with PLT Scheme" at http://docs.plt-scheme.org/more/index.html and noted that changes I made to serve.ss weren't picked up after running (enter! "serve.ss"). I'm running mzscheme on Windows XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a text file, "serve.ss", in the same directory where you started mzscheme, with the following content:

#lang scheme

(define (go)
  'yep-it-works)

2. In mzscheme load the file and run go:

> (enter! "serve.ss")
 [loading C:\Documents and Settings\dcuthbertson\My Documents\Scheme\serve.ss]
 [loading C:\Apps\PLT\collects\scheme\lang\compiled\reader_ss.zo]
 [loading C:\Apps\PLT\collects\syntax\compiled\module-reader_ss.zo]
>(go)
yep-it-works

3. In your text editor, change "yep-it-works" in "serve.ss" to "serve.ss-reloaded", and save the file.
4. In mzscheme reload and run:

>(enter! "serve.ss")
>(go)
yep-it-works

5. Note that the old message is displayed, so try unloading and reloading:

>(enter! #f)
>(go)
yep-it-works

6. Sigh quietly, report the problem and move on with the tutorial. :)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 12 Jun 2008 12:56:46 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed for the next release. `enter!' was missing a path-case-normalization
step that's needed under Windows.

Thanks for the report.
