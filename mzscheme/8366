>Description:
The example in section 12.6.3.1 (Certificate Propagation) causes an "uncertified context" error, even though this is an example that is supposed to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
(module m mzscheme
  (provide def-go)
  (define (unchecked-go n x) 
    (+ n 17))
  (define-syntax (def-go stx)
   (syntax-case stx ()
     [(_ go)
      #'(define-syntax (go stx)
          (syntax-case stx ()
           [(_ x)
            #'(unchecked-go 8 x)]))])))

(module n mzscheme
  (require m)
  (def-go go)
  (go 10)) ; access to unchecked-go is allowed

Reason>>> Now fixed in SVN.

This was a problem in the recently improved compilation
of `syntax' forms, where certificates were getting lost
in the construction of a new syntax object (after subtituting
for pattern variables).

It's a little surprising that we went so long without
noticing the problem, and worse that I almost forgot
about the PR --- good thing I started cleaining out my
inbox. A new test case means we won't overlook it again.

Thanks very much for the report!

Matthew
