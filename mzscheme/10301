>Description:
The contract of regexp-match's output is currently documented as:

(or/c
 (listof (or/c string? #f))
 (listof (or/c bytes? #f))
 #f)

A more precise contract is:

(or/c
 (cons/c string? (listof (or/c string? #f)))
 (cons/c bytes? (listof (or/c bytes? #f)))
 #f)

I think this change clarifies role of the first element of the result list: it is always present, it is never #f, and it represents the entire matched portion of the input, while the tail represents potentially unmatched portions corresponding to parenthesis-delimited parts of the regexp.

The result contracts for similar functions (regexp-try-match, etc.) can have the same change.
