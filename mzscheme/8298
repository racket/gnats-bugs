>Description:
Feature request:

I'd love a contract constructor
    promise/c : Contract -> Flat-Contract
that recognizes promises that produce values that match the original contract.

If it turns out that only
    promise/c : Flat-Contract -> Flat-Contract
is possible, that'd be fine too.  (I'm not sure I've ever needed a promise that produces a lambda.)

 Turns out that promise/c already exists, but I see I forgot to document
 it! Docs are now checked in.
 
 promise/c can't return flat contracts -- there is no simple predicate
 to determine if a promise is going to yield a good value (even when
 given a flat contract) without forcing the promise, but that would
 change the behavior of the program, so the contract library can't do
 it.
 
 If you need a flat contract, you'll have to force the promise yourself.
