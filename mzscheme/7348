>Description:
The Linux version of drscheme does not display the Turkish special characters correctly and refuses to allow them to be input from the keyboard.
The windows version does not have this fault. 
I pasted some example code below.

(define s\x{0131}f\x{0131}r ())

can get an alpha release from the web site if you need to
use Unicode.
