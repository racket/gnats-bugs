The recent changes to subprocess etc made readline misbehave:

  Welcome to Racket v5.1.0.3.
  > (require readline/rep)
  > (system "ls")
  ...directory listing...
  #t

and now the readline prompt is not shown.  It still works fine, just
no prompt after every use of `system'.

 I'm not sure how to fix this, yet, but the relevant changes were just
 in readline.
 
 
 Old behavior (v5.0.2):
 
  > (begin (read-char) ; consumes the available newline
           (read-bytes-avail!* (make-bytes 10)))
  (+ 1 2)
  8
 
 That's the wrong result. The input port is not supposed to block in
 response to `read-bytes-avail!*'.
 
 This bad behavior became more significant when the Racket REPL could be
 used with GUI programs, because blocking on any read meant that GUI
 events wouldn't get handled while the REPL was waiting.
 
 
 The new behavior on the same example has the correct non-blocking
 behavior, but the prompt gets swallowed:
 
  > (begin (read-char) (read-bytes-avail!* (make-bytes 10)))
  0
  (+ 1 2)
  3
 
 The problem is that at the point that the read is requested by
 `read-bytes-avail!*', it's not time to print a prompt. But no data
 actually becomes available until after it is time to print a prompt.
 So, it's a race condition between the start of a new
 `readline-bytes/hist' call as the start of a new REPL prompt.
 
 The problem shows up with `system' because `system' pumps stdin to the
 subprocess.

 Maybe a suitable solution involves allowing something like a 'line
 buffer mode?  That is, it'll keep an input buffer and give you data
 only up to a newline, and will add to the buffer only if you read
 beyond that newline --?
 
 (Seems like something that the readline reader should do anyway, but I
 wonder if it should be generalized.)
