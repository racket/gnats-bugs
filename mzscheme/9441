 Does this mean that there is something that the makefile does after
 running setup-plt? What is it?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 The only thing that install-common-last does now is run the unix-style
 path tweaker, and there's no reason not to run it if user libraries
 fail.  But there's also the conceptual problem of getting an error
 code from `make', which is not really an error with the plt build.
 
 I'm not sure what tthe right solution -- IIRC, Matthew had some good
 reasons for not to drop user-libraries in setup-plt, so maybe some new
 flag that will make it not return an error code for errors in user
 code?  (But that feels kludgy.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 18 Jan 2011 04:57:47 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
