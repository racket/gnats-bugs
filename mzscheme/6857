>Description:
In the top-level, if a variable reference occurs (inside a lambda) before the variable is bound by require, a "reference to undefined identifier" error occurs when the reference is evaluated.

If this behavior is necessary, it would still be helpful to improve the error message for such cases.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (f x) (g x))

(module m mzscheme
  (provide g)
  (define (g x) (* x x)))

(require m)

 Nothing to do with drscheme. I've moved it to Matthew.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 11 Jul 2006 13:34:47 -0400
Reason>>> That's how the (hopeless) top level works.
