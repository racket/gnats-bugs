I think the output would be improved if the unit of measure was added, like: 

CPU time: 8187 ms; real time: 10719 ms; GC time: 1079 ms.

Still better, IMO, would be if the times were expressed in seconds:

CPU time: 8.187 s; real time: 1.0719 s; GC time: 1.079 s.

This requires less mental effort, and is more future-proof
