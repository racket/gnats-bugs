>Description:
I'm trying to use a language feature in a strange way, and I'm pretty sure I am getting incorrect results (see the included code).  I define a macro to define macros, then try to apply it to itself.  My guess is that it's a scoping issue.  Thanks for looking.
>How-To-Repeat:
;ran with pretty big (version 206p1)

;define a macro to define macros.  it's supposed to be
;(pdefine macroname args macrobody)
(define-macro pdefine
  (lambda (a b c)
    `(define-macro ,a (lambda ,b ,c))))

;some simple cases to prove that it works:
(pdefine glot (a) a)
(glot '1)
;returns 1

(pdefine further 
         (c d)
         (print `(,c ,d)))
(further 5 2)
;prints (5 2)

;case that doesn't seem to work
(pdefine further2 
         (c d e) 
         (pdefine c d e))
(further2 something (x) (print x))
;error: undeclared identifier: pdefine

 Didn't you mean
 
  (pdefine further2 
           (c d e) 
           `(pdefine ,c ,d ,e))
 
 ? That variant works for me.
