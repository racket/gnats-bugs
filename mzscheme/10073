>Description:
'provide/contract' doesn't check for duplicate exports. This leads to odd error messages.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(define x 1)
(provide/contract
 [x number?]
 [x integer?])

=>
module: duplicate definition for identifier in: provide/contract-pos-module-source-x
>Fix:
the contract library just wasn't checking for that. It now is.
>Release-Note:
This is something like a contract error in a macro. So we don't have support for that, yet, altho it does seem like it could have been a contract error.

Not a type error, unless types track complex structural invariants in syntax objects.

 I've checked in a fix for this, but I'd like to use the last argument
 to raise-syntax-error to do a better job. But it seems to loop for me
 (I sent a separate message to Matthew about this, btu I just want to
 make a note here so I am sure to update the call before closing this
 PR.)
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
