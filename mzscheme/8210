>Description:
The version of rec provided by (lib "etc.ss") is a strict subset of that provided by (lib "31.ss" "srfi"), but it's kind of a pain to require the latter (for example, Swindle exports all of etc.ss).  It would be nice if etc.ss and srfi/31.ss exported the same rec.

Moreover, the reference implementation of SRFI 31 allows dotted formal arguments, e.g. "(rec (foo . args) ...)" which is useful, even if it's not strictly part of the SRFI, but srfi/31.ss does not allow it.  It would be nice if it did.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by robby at Mon, 07 Aug 2006 09:31:56 -0400
Reason>>> rbf

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Mon, 07 Aug 2006 09:31:56 -0400
Reason>>> took the srfi 31 implementation, moved it to (lib "etc.ss"), added support for 
dotted args, and then changed srfi31 to point to (lib "etc.ss"). Also added a 
few tests to collects/tests/mzscheme/function.ss.
