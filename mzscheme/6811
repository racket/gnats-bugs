>Description:
Towards the end of the desription of "scheme_add_managed" is the following
sentence:

"
If m (or the current custodian if m is NULL), then f is called immediately, and the result is NULL. 
"

I think it should read
"If m (or the current custodian if m is NULL) is shut down, then f is
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
called immediately and the result is NULL."

I'm not sure if this what was meant to be said, but the original makes little sense as it is.

such content)

Reason>>> Fixed for the v299/v300 series.

Thanks for the edit,
