>Description:
I'm trying to assign my students a problem involving a digital thermometer, displaying things like 98.6, 102.4, etc.  But I can't get a string form of a number in decimal: (number->string ...), (format "~v" ...), (format "~a" ...), and (format "~s" ...) all produce an improper-fraction representation.  I've tried changing the language between mixed-fraction output and repeating-decimals output, and that doesn't seem to affect the behavior of any of these functions either.

 Running (number->string (exact->inexact my-number)) should display a
 decimal approximation.
