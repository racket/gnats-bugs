>Description:
`hash-set!' produces an error message about <mutable table> when given anything other than a mutable hashtable. I was initially confused by this type, I would expect it to say <mutable hash table>

(hash-set! (hash) 2 3)
; hash-set!: expects type <mutable table> as 1st argument, given: '#hash();

<mutable table> appears on lines 2330 and 2207 of src/racket/list.c.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by samth at Sun, 03 Jun 2012 11:06:05 -0400
Reason>>> Error message changed in recent refactoring.
