>Description:
Trying to start just-downloaded 3.99.0.13 version results in following error message:

/Applications/PLT\ Scheme\ v3.99.0.13/DrScheme.app/Contents/MacOS/DrScheme
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/PLT Scheme v3.99.0.13/DrScheme.app/Contents/MacOS/../../../lib/PLT_MrEd.framework/Versions/3.99.0.13_3m/PLT_MrEd
  Reason: Incompatible library version: PLT_MrEd requires version 7.0.0 or later, but libiconv.2.dylib provides version 5.0.0
Trace/BPT trap

If I had to guess, I'd say that this means that the build machine has upgraded to MacOS 10.5.x, since building 3.99.0.12?  I would also guess that building everything myself, from source, would not have this problem, as it would link against the installed version.  I just thought that I should let you know about it.

 Yes.

 Does anyone know if there's a way to install & link against the older
 library?  If not, maybe I should switch to 10.4 machines (assuming
 there are 10.4 machines around.)

 Hi Eli,
 
 As far as I can tell, this was resolved quite quickly.  I've been  
 running .23 on my PPC mac for a while, now, no problems.  I'm in the  
 process of upgrading to Leopard on an intel Mac, so I'll be one fewer  
 hold-out that you need to account for.
 
 Cheers,
