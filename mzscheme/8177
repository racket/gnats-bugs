evaluate these two forms:

 AFAICT, this also causes a bus error in the current 351 release  
 candidate.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 21 Jul 2006 08:37:36 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN for v351.

The bug was in the JIT-generated check for the last argument
of a semi-inlined `string-set!'. The generate code checked the type
tag, but didn't first check that the argument is a non-fixnum (in
which case there's no type tag).

Thanks very much for the report,
Matthew
