>Description:
syntax-local-make-delta-introducer: not defined as syntax: #<syntax:/Users/cce/Desktop/delta.rkt:8:7 dummy>

I get the error above from the program below.  The documentation for syntax-local-make-delta-introducer does not mention anything about its argument needing to be bound.  I don't know which is wrong, the function or its documentation, although I suspect it is the function.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require (for-syntax syntax/parse))
(define-syntax delta
  (syntax-parser
    [(_ x:id)
     (void (syntax-local-make-delta-introducer #'x))
     #'(begin)]))
(delta dummy)
