>Description:
It would be nice to see the other arguments to
build-path when there's an error.
>How-To-Repeat:
> (build-path (collection-path "doc") (collection-path "mzlib"))
build-path: absolute path "/Users/robby/cvs/exp/plt/collects/mzlib/../../MrEd.app/Contents/MacOS/../../../collects/mzlib" cannot be added to a pathname

;; only see one path in error message.
