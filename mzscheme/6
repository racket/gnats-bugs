>Description:
Matthew told me that there was a predicate for testing if a pathname
was absolute.  I asked if it was called absolute-path?, and he said
yes.  I can't find any such predicate; I've grep'ed in the mzlib
directory and also in the MzScheme index in unreleased/.

Tell me what the predicate is called. (-:

State-Changed-Why:

The mzscheme manual has the information you want. Look in the pathnames
section. You either want "relative-path?" or "complete-path?" depending on
what you are doing. (don't we just love platform-independance?)

Sorry for replying by email the first time.

 It's of course in the mzscheme manual, under the pathnames section. you
 might want "complete?" and you might want "relative?"
