>Description:
If you load the following program as an extension into 
MzScheme 200alpha7, followed by ^Z, you get a crash:

#include "escheme.h"



void closer(Scheme_Object *obj,



Scheme_Close_Custodian_Client *fun,void *data) {

  // a "return" here before any work is done gets rid of the crash

  FILE *fp;

  fp=fopen("foo.dat","w");

  fprintf(fp,"bar");

  return;

}





Scheme_Object *scheme_initialize(Scheme_Env *env) {

  scheme_add_atexit_closer(closer);

  return scheme_make_string("hello world");

}



Scheme_Object *scheme_module_name(void) {

  return scheme_make_symbol("junk");

}



Scheme_Object *scheme_reload(Scheme_Env *env) {

  return scheme_initialize(env);

}

Two points:

 1) (exit) doesn't cause a crash, and the file gets written
 2) This is essentially the same problem as the closed PR 2039,
     where the error occurred on (exit)

>How-To-Repeat:
Compile above program

(load-extension "junk.dll")

Type ^Z

State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed in the exp-tagged code.
    
    The problem had to do with the switch to DLLs. The
    MzScheme library has its own copy of the C library,
    and atexit closers are attached to that copy of the
    library. The DLL, however, used a different copy of
    the library, and that copy was "closed" earlier than
    MzScheme's. Thus, when MzScheme calls the atexit closer,
    the DLL's C library is no longer usable.
    
    The solution is to always exit thorugh a call to exit()
    within the MzScheme DLL.
