>Description:
The following exhausts all of memory:


#lang racket
(require mzlib/pconvert)

(define-struct graph-node 
  (value neighbors distances)
  #:transparent
  #:mutable)

(define test-graph 
  (shared ([A (make-graph-node "A" (list B C) (list 10 10))]
           [B (make-graph-node "B" (list A C) (list 10 10))]
           [C (make-graph-node "C" (list A B) (list 10 10))])
    (list A B C)))

(define x (first test-graph))
(define a-hash (hash x 10))
(print-convert a-hash)
