>Description:
I would like to have a compilation manager that doesn't
create new .zo files. Instead, it just loads any existing
.zo files that are okay and loads .scm files if the .zo
files isn't okay.

I want to use this when developing DrScheme. Typically,
as I develop, I am working on the same small set of files
and it doesn't make sense to recompile them and rewrite
them to disk over and over. Instead, just loading the
.ss files would be fine.
