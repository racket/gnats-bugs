Scheme_Object *scheme_make_port_type(char *name)

Creates a new port subtype.

Scheme_Input_Port *scheme_make_input_port( Scheme_Object *subtype, 
                   void *data, 
                   int (*getc_fun)(Scheme_Input_Port*), 
                   int (*peekc_fun)(Scheme_Input_Port*), 
                   int (*char_ready_fun)(Scheme_Input_Port*), 
                   void (*close_fun)(Scheme_Input_Port*), 
                   void (*need_wakeup_fun)(Scheme_Input_Port*, void *), 
                   int must_close)

Creates a new input port with arbitary control functions. The pointer data will be installed as the port's user data, which can be extracted/set with the SCHEME_INPORT_VAL macro. The C value EOF should be used by getc_fun to return an end-of-file. If peekc_fun is NULL, it is automatically implemented in terms of getc_fun.

The function need_wakeup_fun will be invoked when the port is blocked on a read; need_wakeup_fun should set appropriate bits in fds to specify which file ---------> decriptior(s)<----------- it is blocked on. The fds argument is conceptually an array of three fd_set structs (one for read, one for write, one for exceptions), but manipulate this array using scheme_get_fdset to get a particular element of the array, and use MZ_FD_XXX instead of FD_XXX to manipulate a single ``fd_set''. Under Windows and BeOS, each ``fd_set'' can also contain OS-level semaphores or other handles via scheme_add_fd_handle.

Although the return type of scheme_make_input_port is Scheme_Input_Port *, it can be cast into a Scheme_Object *.

If must_close is non-zero, the new port will be registered with the current custodian, and close_fun is guranteed to be called before the port is garbage-collected.

Scheme_Output_Port *scheme_make_output_port( Scheme_Object *subtype, 
                    void *data, 
                    void (*write_string_fun)(char *, long, Scheme_Output_Port*), 
                    void (*close_fun)(Scheme_Output_Port*), 
                    int must_close)

Creates a new output port with arbitary control functions. The pointer data will be installed as the port's user data, which can be extracted/set with the SCHEME_OUTPORT_VAL macro. When write_string_fun is called, the second parameter is the length of the string to be written.

Although the return type of -------> scheme_make_input_port is <--------- typo! should be "output_port" Scheme_Output_Port *, it can be cast into a Scheme_Object *.

If must_close is non-zero, the new port will be registered with the current custodian, and close_fun is guranteed to be called before the port is garbage-collected.
