When I use mzmake to build mzscheme it all seems to work until 
the end when it dies trying to link the file: it seems that in process.c
it cannot find the symbol sema_destroy.

What should I do?

Thanks,

 So you're building the Solaris threads version of MzScheme, right?
 
 What version of Solaris are you using? Does `man sema_destroy' give
 you a man page? If so, does it list any library other than -lthread
 and -lc required for the function?
 
 Or perhaps it's a problem with header files. I see that process.c does
 not include <synch.h> as the man page requires. Try adding 
   # include <synch.h>
 near the top of process.c, right after
   # include <thread.h>

 Hi Matt,
 
 Thanks for responding so quickly. =20
 
 First a question: Is this email message legible?  I am on this job about =
 4 days now,
 and I find myself stuck on a Win95 machine using Windows Messaging, the=20
 Internet Explorer 4.0 godforsaken email program.  There doesn't seem to =
 be a setting
 to tell it not to format my email so as I type I see blue characters and =
 black characters=20
 and big fonts and little fonts.  Sheesh.
 
 Second: I've been using LISP off and on since 1984, starting with =
 MacLISP and progressing
 to the Symbolics and Zeta and then Common LISP.  I've never used Scheme =
 prior to about a
 week ago.  A few days ago I read the R4RS, and since then I've looked at =
 your manual: PLT
 MZScheme: Language Manual.=20
 
 I want to say I am very impressed with the MZScheme implementation.  It =
 is has been relatively=20
 easy to build and it looks very powerful.  Congratulations and thank =
 you.
 
 I was able to get MZScheme 50 to build under Solaris (uname -a responds: =
 SunOS 5.5
 Generic_103093-08) sun4m sparc SUNW, SPARCstation-5).
 
 I had to make three changes, two substantial, one not, inorder to build =
 MZScheme
 
 1) In mzmake I changed "gnumake" to be "gmake", and=20
 2) As you suggested in process.c I included a reference to the synch.h =
 include file. =20
 
 It's been several years since I've worked under UNIX.  I found I needed =
 to set USESOLTH within mzmake inorder to build the right system.  I did =
 something tacky, I'm afraid, I hardcoded USESOLTH=3D"yes" within mzmake.
 
 What would you suggest I do?  What would a unix wizard do?
 
 Thanks again for your help,
 
 Jerry Bakin
