>Description:
I just had a web server segmentation fault. I don't have any idea why it might have happened, I'm afraid (I wasn't accessing the site at the time).

I've uploaded the core dump here in case you want to look at it:


I did the only thing I know how - loaded it into gdb and ran backtrace - and got this:

I'm afraid that's as far as my debugging-fu gets. Hope it's of some help. Let me know if I can do anything to help diagnose.

 Hi Eli,
 
 The file upload took a long time. It should be there now (be warned -  
 it's about 240 meg).
 
 Many thanks,

 I was trying to see if there's a slim chance of getting anything
 useful from it, but nothing that I tried worked.  So the only thing
 that can help is trying things on your machine (beginning with a stack
 trace).
 
 BTW, when core files usually compress well -- in that case it went
 down to 40MB with bzip2.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:58 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
