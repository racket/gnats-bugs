>Description:
I've been using MzScheme 202 on my PowerMac G4, which runs MacOS 10.2.  I recently tried to install the latest MzScheme, v203, but the installer complains falsely that the old PLT libraries are actually newer, and then refuses to go any further in the installation.

I've tried to delete or rename all the old PLT files and directories I can find, but this doesn't satisfy the installer.  It still "knows" the other version is there.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Apologies if this issue is addressed in the documentation and I overlooked it.

 This is a known problem, and there's an unpleasant workaround.  The 
 reason that the MacOS 'knows' that the other version is there is 
 because of a file or files in /Library/Receipts.  You need to remove 
 one of the PLT-related ones.  Actually, if you feel like doing a little 
 detective work, try removing them one at a time and tell us which one 
 solves the problem.
 
 Also, this doesn't seem to be a problem with the full DrScheme bundles. 
   Seeing as how these bundles include mzscheme as well, you might just 
 want to try this instead.
 
 Please let us know if this resolves the problem.
 
 Thanks for your patience,

 Dear klipsch (sorry, don't have your name),
 
 did the suggested workaround for your installation problem resolve the  
 issue?
 
 Thanks,

 This bug was about the inability under OS X to install MzScheme over  
 older copies of itself.  This appeared to be due to a bug in the bundle  
 specification.  Did we ever resolve this issue?

 No. Do you know what's wrong with the bundle (i.e., how the MzScheme
 bundle differs from the DrScheme bundle)?
