>Description:
The following code:


(define-syntax (rename-test stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(_ name)
     (with-syntax ([(tmpname) (generate-temporaries (list 'temp))])
       #'(begin (require (rename mzscheme tmpname +))
                (define name tmpname)))]))

(rename-test my+)

Should bind mzscheme's `+' to `my+'.  Instead, it produces the error:

"reference to undefined identifier: temp1.1", 
with the error at `(define name tmpname)'

Is there an approved way to write this macro?

 I'll have to work on this bug.
 
 Meanwhile, for the above simple example, you could use
 
  (define-syntax (rename-test stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ name)
       #'(begin (require (prefix p: mzscheme))
                (define name p:+))]))
 
 No generated variable name is needed. Since the `p:+' is introduced by
 the macro, it can't be referenced outside the macro expansion. Of
 course, I don't know whether that approach works for your real setting.
