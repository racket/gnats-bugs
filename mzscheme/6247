>Description:
in short, compiling the execuatables (running gmake with the default target) works fine, but mzscheme throws a bunch of errors that look like this when compiling the bytecodes as part of a make install.

read (compiled): ill-formed code (bad count: 446 != 447, started at 10)

the output from 'uname -s -r -m'(os, os release, machine type) is:
HP-UX B.10.20 9000/778

gcc version is 2.8.1




>How-To-Repeat:
./configure
gmake
gmake install

happened both times I tried it on the hp-ux boxen running on my schools network.

Reason>>> Should be fixed in v207; problem was related to +0.0 vs. -0.0,
due illegal aliasing in the detection of -0.0.
