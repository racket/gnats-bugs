>Description:
The documentation claims that the "include" special form in include.ss will accept the "lib" special form for an included file, but it doesn't in fact accept it.

See the message:

http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-scheme/2003-September/003474.html

for a suggested bug fix.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following code into the definitions window:

(require (lib "include.ss"))
(include (lib "list.ss"))

Then click "check syntax."
