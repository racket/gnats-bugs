 Scott,
 
 Thank you for the bug report. 
 
 In future, however, it would save me a lot of trouble if I could avoid
 looking at your 2000+ lines of code in 21 files, when this expression:
 
   `(,1 a)
 
 would have been sufficient (not that it took me very long in this
 particular instance). Thanks....
 
 (* * *)
 
 The problem seems to be that there is no original syntax in the
 expanded version of the above expression that corresponds to the parens
 and the `a', so check syntax doesn't color them. I'm not sure what to
 do about that, short of changing the quasiquote macro.
 
 Robby

Responsible-Changed-Why:
    Probably I can fix this. Note that the little example
    looks right in Intermediate (which has its own qq
    implementation for error reporting)
