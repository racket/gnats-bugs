>Description:
(file-position) will return negative numbers for positions past 1 Gibyte.

(file-position pos) will throw an error if pos > 1 G
>How-To-Repeat:
Open an input port for a file larger than 1 Gibyte.
Try to set or get file-positions past 1 G.

Reason>>> In SVN, MzScheme now supports bignum file positions and sizes,
at least to the degree supported by the underlying filesystem API.

On some platforms (e.g., Mac OS X), off_t is a 64-bit value (even on
32-bit platforms), and so 64-bit file positions now work. On other
platforms (e.g., 32-bit Linux), off_t is a signed 32-bit value, and so
the limit is still 2 GB. Adding -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 for CFLAGS
should enable 64-bit file positions on most Linux variants, I think,
and that's worth investigating further.

Windows is handled specially, as usual, and 64-bit positions now
work there.
