  =46rom the manual:
 
 library procedure:=A0=A0(rationalize x y)=A0
 
 Rationalize returns the simplest rational number differing from x by no=20=
 
 more than y. A rational number r1 is simpler than another rational=20
 number r2 if r1 =3D p1/q1 and r2 =3D p2/q2 (in lowest terms) and |p1| <=20=
 
 |p2| and |q1| < |q2|. Thus 3/5 is simpler than 4/7. Although not all=20
 rationals are comparable in this ordering (consider 2/7 and 3/5) any=20
 interval contains a rational number that is simpler than every other=20
 rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies between 2/7 and=20=
 
 3/5). Note that 0 =3D 0/1 is the simplest rational of all.
 
 ...
 
 In your case, the difference between 0 and 2 is less than four, so it's=20=
 
 a legal answer.
