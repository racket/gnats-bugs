 MzScheme leaves it to the constructor of the `message' field in the
 exception. Programs constructing the message may want to consult the
 `error-print-source-location' parameter to decide whether to include
 source information.
 
 (I can imagine changing MzScheme to behave like DrScheme, but not
 anytime soon.)

 Oh! So `raise-syntax-error' is what makes the message look like this?

 stdin::37: x: abc at: 2 in: 1

 Oh! It's the error-print-source-location parameter that I had forgotten about.
 
 Looks like raise-syntax-error isn't just a one liner after all.
 
 I'll close the PR.
