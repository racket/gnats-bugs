Submitted on behalf of Cormac:

I tried loading a unix file into a PC-based drscheme over the
network. The file dialog allowed me to select the file file, and then
DrScheme wrote into the standard output window:

normalize-path: "..." (within the input path) is not a directory or
does not exist.

1. Tis a pity this happened - I'm not sure what caused it

2. I though internal errors should be caught instead of being sent to
stdout.

MzScheme doesn't handle "..." specially, and we haven't
heard more about the need for this in years.
