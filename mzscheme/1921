The following error is reported when trying to compile Dr. Scheme:
gcc -g -O2 -Wall  -DUSE_SENORA_GC  -I./../include -c ./port.c -o port.o
./port.c: In function `scheme_init_port':
./port.c:451: warning: implicit declaration of function `fcntl'

*** Error code 1
>How-To-Repeat:
On an OpenBSD 2.8 system:
gunzip/untar drscheme
go to the directory plt/src
run configure --enable-sgc
run 'make'

 Is this on an x86 machine? Do you know if the compiler defines
 __OpenBSD__?
 
 There's an OpenBSD configuration in plt/src/mzscheme/sconfig.h. I don't
 think it's being used, though, because HAS_BSD_IOB should avoid the
 _cnt problem.
 
 For the F_SETFL problem, probably <fnctl.h> needs to be #included in
 port.c. (That's already fixed for the next release.)
 
 If the FNDELAY problem persists with #include <fnctl.h>, then adding
 USE_FCNTL_O_NONBLOCK to the OpenBSD configuration in sconfig.h would
 probably fix the problem --- at least, if the OpenBSD configuration is
 used.
