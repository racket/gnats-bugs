>Description:
Under MacOS, the result of filesystem-root-list is mixed case,
but the "normal" case is lower case. This means that string=?
style predicates with the results of filesystem-root-list fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
1: create a hard drive with mixed case
2: this expression:
 
    (andmap string=? (filesystem-root-list) (map normal-case-path (filesystem-root-list)))

should return #t

 No filesystem primitive ever normalizes the case of pathnames. (See,
 for example, `directory-list'.) Why should `filesystem-root-list' be
 different?
 
 I think it would be bad to normalize the case. For display purposes,
 the user expects to see a name in mixed case.
