 Did you download a snapshot from the Utah site?
 
 If so, does a download from the Northwestern site work?
 
 
 For me, the Utah snapshot crashes and the Northwestern snapshot works
 on Yosemite. The problem is in the snapshot build process, where an old
 file can get picked up if it's in the wrong place; the Utah snapshot
 machine had an file in that place, and the Northwestern snapshot
 machine doesn't. The next Utah snapshot should be ok, because I've
 moved the file out of the way there (and I'll work on the build
 system).

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 28 Sep 2014 10:47:52 -0400
Reason>>> Utah snapshot configuration fixed to pick up the recent repair for Yosemite.
