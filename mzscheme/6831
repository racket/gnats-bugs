>Description:
When running the following under Cygwin, mzscheme crashes:
$ mzscheme -mve '(begin (printf "~n") (display "foo"))'
Windows pops up the following message (translated from Spanish):

Program error
MzScheme.exe generated errors and will be closed by Windows.
You should restart the program
Error log will be created.

I don't know where to look for this error log so I can't send it.

Cheers,
Grzegorz
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following at the Cygwin prompt (on Windows 2000)
$ mzscheme -mve '(begin (printf "~n") (display "foo"))'

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 10:00:06 -0400
Reason>>> mzscheme

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 28 Jan 2005 11:18:55 -0500
Reason>>> Seems to work fine these days, with a recent Cygwin and a recent MzScheme
