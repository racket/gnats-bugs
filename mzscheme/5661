>Description:
Can the error message about "no module found" be changed to include something about what it did find?

I get this error message:

load-handler: expected a `module' declaration for `index' in "/Users/robby/Sites/html/index.scm", but found something else

but when I look at the file, I see "(module index" at the
front and executing it in drscheme works fine. I can't
seem to make a simple case to reproduce the problem,
either.
