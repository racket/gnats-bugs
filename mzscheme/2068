>Description:
If you put %X in a format string for scheme_signal_error(), you get
a crash.  Even though we're in the C world, I don't think a 
crash is the right thing to do.  Probably the %X should just 
be printed verbatim or just ignored.


>How-To-Repeat:
In a MzScheme extension, write:

  scheme_signal_error("This crashes: %X",42);
