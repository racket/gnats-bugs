>Description:
The printable/c contract doesn't seem to like prefab structs.
This is sort of a show-stopper for a package I'm working on,
which provides a DrScheme tool that marshalls its settings as
prefab structs.

(For now I can probably work around it by converting the
prefab struct to a list and back again.)

This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.

 Is there a predicate for recognizing prefab structs?

 `prefab-struct-key' essentially acts as the predicate.
