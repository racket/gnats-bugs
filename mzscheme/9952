>Description:
So I like to read the PLT docs a lot, via my web browser.  I read 'em so much that I want the browser to contain a bookmark that points to 'em.  However, if I simply bookmark, e.g., $HOME/.plt-scheme/4.1.3/doc/index.html, that's bad because it contains the version number; if I then update to a newer version, the bookmark becomes "stale" -- i.e., it no longer points to the relevant documentation.

So my life would be easier if the PLT installation process created a symlink named, say, $HOME/.plt-scheme/latest which pointed to (in this example) $HOME/.plt-scheme/4.1.3; and if it were to also update that link whenever I install, to keep it current.  That way I could just bookmark $HOME/.plt-scheme/latest/doc/index.html once and for all.

 Just in case: you know about 'plt-help' right? You can run that from a
 commandline and it will send you to that page.
