Of these three expressions, the first gives the wrong answer,
The rest are closely related but evaluate correctly.

Reason>>> Fixed for the next release (but in SVN currently only
on a branch that will be merged soon).

The bug is specific to the case of a negative
imginary part for an exact imaginary number
whose magnitude is also exact.

Thanks for the bug report!

 Thanks for the instant response.
 
 If you are in and about the square root logic here is an improvement  
 that you might use.
 See (http://cap-lore.com/code/sqrt/).
 
 (define a 0.000004+3.1i)
 (define (sq x) (* x x))
 (sqrt (sq a)) ; => 3.999999999929581e-06+3.1000000000000005i
 
 Notice that only about 11 digits survive this calculation that is not  
 inherently problematical.
 When the argument of sqrt is near the negative real axis most simple  
 complex square roots loose precision.
 (Some simple expressions for complex square root have other sensitive  
 regions.)
 The C code referred above steers the argument away from the negative  
 real axis.
 Indeed it keeps the real part positive and the exponents moderate.
 
 The routine sqrT below is a transcription into Scheme of that C code  
 and yields
 (sqrT (sq a)) ; => 3.999999999999999e-06+3.1000000000000005i
 
 The C code also steers the argument away from very big and very small  
 values where floating exponent may overflow or underflow.
 For mid-range arguments the ultimate simple expression needs to  
 square these values in order to take their square root.
 
 
 (define (sqrT x) (let*
    ((A (real-part x))(B (imag-part x)) (aA (magnitude A))(aB  
 (magnitude B))
       (bg (expt 2 150))(bg2 (* bg bg))(sm (/ bg))(sm2 (* sm sm)))
    (if (negative? A) (* (if (negative? B) 0-i 0+i) (sqrT (- x)))
    (if (or (> aA bg2) (> aB bg2)) (* bg (sqrT (* sm2 x)))
    (if (and (< aA sm2) (< aB sm2)) (if (and (zero? aA) (zero? aB)) x
          (* sm (sqrT (* bg2 x))))
      (let ((r (sqrt (/ (+ A (sqrt (+ (* A A) (* B B)))) 2))))
         (+ r (* 0+i (/ B (* 2 r))))))))))
 
 The C code has been fairly well tested. The Scheme code has not.
 Note: the values bg, bg2, sm, sm2 are compile time constants in C.
 
 You can use the Scheme or C code any way you wish!
 
 Thanks for MzScheme!
