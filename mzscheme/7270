Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Mon, 14 Mar 2005 17:12:04 -0500
Reason>>> mzscheme docs

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 22 Mar 2005 15:09:12 -0500
Reason>>> Changed the docs. The first three printouts
can happen in many orders, so I just weakened
the example to claim no specific order.
