>Description:
Some numbers evaluates to snips.
Pasting the snip into the Definitions window is fine --
  you can right-click and change the representation.
However, if you put the snip in a string, DrScheme
  complains about non-characters in a string.
This is especially a problem when a teacher writes
  (f x) "should be <snip>"
-- looks fine on screen, but doesn't work, and looks
  pretty baffling!
>How-To-Repeat:
Set language to Beginning Student.
Type 
  48.8
in the REPL.
Copy the corresponding output into the Definitions Window
  and enclose it in double quotes (string).
Click Execute.
DrScheme says
  read: found non-character while reading a string
and highlights from before the opening " to the end of
  the number.

 I changed the title of this one, since it's not really about pasting
 per se. 
 
 From what I can tell, there is nothing to be done except signal a
 read-time error in this case; strings in mzscheme cannot contain
 non-characters. Any other thoughts?

 Then I'll close the older PR, 5626.

 Maybe there should be a kind of snip that is willing to produce text if
 needed for a port. (That reduces the problem to comminucating to a
 custom input port when text is needed.)

 Thanks. I thought I remembered an older one, but wasn't sure. I see
 that SK submitted it! ;)

 Are you suggesting that in this case that should happen? I thoguht
 about that and rejected the idea; it doesn't seem to be what the user
 is asking for. If they really want a string of the digits perhaps we
 can provide support for that in the GUI for teachers (of course,
 number->string already does this for the advanced folks).

 Well, it already signals a read-time error, as you can see.  In an
 ideal world, strings would permit snips.  I think it looks *really*
 confusing for someone to see
 
   (f x) "should return 48.8"
 
 on screen but be given a bizarre error.  Next best would be for the
 error to be detailed along these lines:
 
   You pasted the number ... into the buffer, but you need to retype
   the number ...
 
 It's very unfortunate if we lose the ability to paste answers back
 into the source, because we explicitly tell people to do that.

 Going back to the concrete example in the bug report, what happens if
 they paste the snip into the string, then right-click and change the
 print representation to one of the truly graphical ones (such as
 fractions)?  What string to convert it to?
 
 I guess in the special case where it's a "rational number snip", it
 makes sense to convert to the canonical number (rational, in these
 cases).

 I don't agree -- to me what should happen in these cases is that this
 string:
 
   "<snip>"
 
 should have length 1 and the string-ref at 0 should return the snip.
 Since this clearly is impossible in the current mzscheme, I think that
 it must be an error. If they wanted the characters there, they should
 turn the snip into characters explicitly.
 
 I can certainly add this to the popup menu as an option, and of course 
 
   (number->string <snip>)
 
 will do the right thing.
