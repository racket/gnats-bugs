The launcher created binaries on the mac cannot find mzscheme. I suggest
that they should remember the path to the mzscheme that created them (if
that possible) and fall back on the finder database.
>How-To-Repeat:
make a launcher mzscheme binary
move it to another folder
double click on it

State-Changed-Why:

I think this is the right behavior for launchers: always use the
MzScheme/MrEd in the launcher's directory. Otherwise, what is the
behavior of a relocated launcher when multiple versions of MzScheme
are installed on a machine?

I'm opposed to hardwiring a path in a launcher binary because it's
hidden state. A hardwired path in a launcher would prevent you from
freely moving the PLT folder after creating an alias. Suppose a
DrScheme user moves the PLT folder. He would have a hard time
understanding why DrScheme no longer worked (unless he's used to
taking abuse from Windows :) or why double-clicking on his old
DrScheme 53 icon (saved because he's not sure he wants to upgrade)
launches the new DrScheme 100.

The current convention works well because you can make an alias for a
launcher, put that alias anywhere, and there's no new hidden state
(only the hidden state of MacOS aliases, and the OS manages that
complexity for us).

Reason>>> I lost this battle, and then the issue disappeared anyway
since we no longer support Mac OS Classic.
