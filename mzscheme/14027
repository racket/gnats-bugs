the filesystem (as a linked package):

  $ raco pkg install dummy-pkg/

and now edit the package in-place:
  $ vim dummy-pkg/racket.rkt
  $ cat dummy-pkg/racket.rkt
  #lang racket

This package now overwrites the module name used for
Typed Racket's #lang since the conflict is not prevented.

(this could probably be done for non-linked packages too and
 even automated by, say, writing to the package contents at
 compile-time)

 I don't think we can support anything different than this. The package
 (the thing that was installed) had no conflicts. Something you did to
 the install directory behind the back of the package system caused an
 error in Racket, but it is not something that is part of the package
 and thus not under the purview of the package system. I assume that
 since you sent this PR you will disagree with this reading. Can you go
 into more detail about why you think these behind the back changes are
 okay? Would you expect deb/apt or other OS package system to keep
 track of something like this?

 Just as clarification, I don't see what's 'behind the back' here. The
 default mode for 'raco pkg install' is to use '--link' when given a
 directory, so this is a directory that's supposed to be ok to edit.
 
 I don't think that this is necessarily a pkg-level error, though -- I
 bet we could trigger this just with 'raco link'.

 As Sam said already, anything installed with --link is likely
 to get edited as a part of the development process. My main concern
 is that this could happen by accident during development, and you
 won't notice until a `require` is quietly redirected and causes
 an error.
 
 Maybe conflicts could instead be enforced at `setup` time as well?  That
 way you would get a sanity check even if this happened.

 An aspect of the current design is that you're supposed to be able to
 install conflicts via `--force` if you really want (e.g., to shadow an
 installation-wide package with a user-specific one), so whatever might
 be improved, it's probably more complicated than having `raco setup`
 check for conflicts.

 I agree. I think that the draw of Asumu is that 'raco pkg' never gets
 control in usual situations. Clearly it's impractical for every call
 to 'racket' to check all the conflicts, maybe it's too late to expect
 'raco pkg' to start by checking everything, and maybe 'raco setup' is
 a middle ground. My gut tells me that --link is basically equivalent
 to --force, it means "trust me because you can't do anything better"

 I think this would be worrying if so, since we expect people to use
 --link for development. --link does check dependencies at install
 time, right?

 We could definitely do a 'raco pkg check' and we could ensure that
 'raco pkg update' does something similar (because it removes and
 reinstalls, checking new conflicts/deps in the process). Perhaps the
 right way to look at this is that with a linked package, you need to
 run "raco pkg update" periodically
