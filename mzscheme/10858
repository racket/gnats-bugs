Computer Language: (("Determine language from source") (#(#t write mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug) (default) #() "#lang scheme\n" #t))
>Description:
The module language (do we have a better name for this now?) doesn't work at all for me.  The problem seems to be with automatic creation of compiled files.
>How-To-Repeat:
0. Create a fresh directory.
1. Create a new file, test.ss, with the contents "#lang scheme", in the directory.
2. Open DrScheme on test.ss.
3. Hit run.

Get the error: Interactions disabled: scheme does not support a REPL (no #%top-interaction)

Reason>>> The immediate problem is now fixed, though the MzScheme
bug was exposed by the bug for PR 10859.
