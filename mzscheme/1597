>Description:
The explode-path primitives should return:

  (cons "Cupertino:" (cons "robby" empty))

for this expression:

  (explode-path "Cupertino:robby")

on my machine (where "Cupertino" is the name of the root hd).
Instead, it returns:

  (cons "Cupertino" (cons "robby" empty))

which is a relative path, since:

  (build-path "Cupertino" "robby")
  =
  ":Cupertino:robby"

which is not the same thing as "Cupertino:robby". The latter is
an absolute path and the former is a relative path.

 I think the real problem is that `split-path' should preserve the
 trailing colon in the returned name when given a root name argument.
 
 If that sounds right to both of you, I'll try to make the change.
