>Description:
cons inside shared creates lists that first and rest do not recognize.  This at least creates error messages that don't make much sense, but ideally, the result ought to work.  

Note that length also halts with an error, but it is not a "list is circular" error but rather the same "not a non-empty list" kind of error.

However, list-ref still works on these lists.

 I said this elsewhere, but so that it gets into the PR trail, I
 consider the fact that this program:
 
 (define web-colors
  (shared ([W (cons "white" G)]
          [G (cons "grey" W)])
   W))
 
 (rest web-colors) => rest: expected argument of type <non-empty list>;
 given #0='("white" "grey" . #0#)
 
 
 when run in ASL, used to work a few versions ago (in 5.0.2 according
 to Ryan) and no longer does to be a bug (not the #lang racket aspect
 of this).
 
 I was probably not clear about this my earlier messages. My apologies.
 
 Robby
