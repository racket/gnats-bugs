>Description:
The following expressions have different error messages, when they are the same error, thus should have the same message.

>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "change-request" to "not-a-bug" by mflatt at Sun, 27 Nov 2011 12:13:58 -0500
Reason>>> the error is technically different

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 27 Nov 2011 12:13:58 -0500
Reason>>> The rules for macro expansion are different at phase level N for N = 0 versus N 
> 0.  In N > 0, a reference to an unbound identifier is rejected only when
the module is fully expanded, which means that it might be evaluated.
In contrast, for N = 0, unbound identifiers are disallowed before the module
is run. The different error messages correctly report different kinds of errors.

The expansion rules have to be different, because code at N > 0 must be
run to expand the module, while code at N = 0 need not be run before the
module is expanded.
