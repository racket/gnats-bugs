>Description:
When building PLT Scheme from source, after running ./configure --enable-shared; make; make install, the install fails during the setup-plt phase because it can't find the shared libraries to run mzscheme. This patch fixes the problem:

 IIRC, the problem is that there is no complete support for the binary
 to find the shared object files.  If this is correct, then your patch
 is fine for now, but not a good solution for the problem.

 The above works fine for me using Dapper. Unfortunately, I don't yet
 see why it would break elsewhere.
 
 On the other hand, I understand the problem when DESTDIR is used, and I
 see why your patch would solve the problem. Did you set DESTDIR, or is
 there something else going on?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

Reason>>> DESTDIR problem fixed by using `mzscheme'
from the build location to run setup
