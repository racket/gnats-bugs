When you do a read between 2 read-lines or just the opposit, you can't give any input.
>How-To-Repeat:
read between read-lines:
------------------------
(display "give input test1: ")
(define test1 (read-line))
(display "give input test2: ")
(define test2 (read))
(display "give input test3: ")
(define test3 (read-line))
(display "give input test4: ")
(define test4 (read-line))

test1
test2
test3
test4



read-lines between reads:
-------------------------

(display "give input test5: ")
(define test5 (read))
(display "give input test6: ")
(define test6 (read-line))
(display "give input test7: ")
(define test7 (read))
(display "give input test8: ")
(define test8 (read))

 Output is buffered until you either write a newline for explicitly call
 `flush-output':
 
  (display "give input test1: ")
  (fluish-output)
  (define test1 (read-line))

 Sorry - I answered the wrong question.

 I think you're complaining that `test3' gets bound to the empty string.
 The problem is that `read' does not consume writespace following
 whatever it reads, including newlines. So `test3' gets the rest of the
 line after whatever is consumed for `test2'.
 
 To make this slightly clearer, try providing the input
 
    1 2
 
 for test2.
