>Description:
you'll see

       call-with-output-file: "/tmp/a-test-directory/" exists as a directory

But that's wrong: no such directory exists.  I suspect that message should instead say something like "that path ends with a slash, so I don't want to treat it as the name of a file", or something.
>How-To-Repeat:
;; delete any file or directory you might have named /tmp/a-test-directory/, then run this:
(let ((dirname "/tmp/a-test-directory/"))
  (call-with-output-file dirname
    (lambda (op)
      (display "Hi there"))))
