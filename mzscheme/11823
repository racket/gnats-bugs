 That's intentional -- you have a \u2028 character there (replaced with
 "[*]" above), which you might have missed.
 
 But there's a different bug here -- that this character is rendered as
 nothing in drracket, but it looks like it should be rendered as a
 newline.
 
 Also, looking at the relevant pages, I think that a form-feed
 character should also terminate a comment.
