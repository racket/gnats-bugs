>Description:
The "libtool" version used in FreeBSD creates ".la" files that
from the libtool version bundled with DrScheme v350 doesn't grok.
As a consequence a FreeBSD build with --enable-shared fails.

The fix I used was to patch "./configure" to use the FreeBSD
version of "libtool" instead of the bundled one.  The patch
is available at the following URL:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/lang/drscheme/files/patch-configure?rev=1.1

This patch relies on environment variable "${LIBTOOL}" being set by
the port build process, so isn't suitable for direct inclusion
into DrScheme.

What is requested is that "./configure" be given an option to
override the specific libtool program used by the rest of the
build.

I didn't find "configure.in" anywhere; otherwise I would have sent
in a proper patch.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a recent FreeBSD 4.11 / 5.5 / 6.1 system, download DrScheme's v350
source tarball and run:

 % configure --enable-shared --enable-cairo --enable-pthread

'cairo' should have been installed using the ports system.  The
current version in ports is v1.0.4_1.

 % gmake
 ... this will fail when trying to link mred since DrScheme's
     libtool doesn't parse the ".la" files installed by Cairo's
     build.

 I've added an --enable-lt flag to our `configure' script, so you could
 run something like
 
  configure --enable-shared --enable-lt=/usr/bin/libtool ...
 
 or
 
  configure --enable-shared --enable-lt="${LIBTOOL}" ...
 
 to change the libtool used by the build.
 
 Is that the right sort of change, or do you need something more
 automatic (e.g., if $LIBTOOL is set)?

 This should be enough, thanks!
