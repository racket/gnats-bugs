>Description:
This works as expected:

  winooski:~ eli> mz -qnlli r5rs srfi/28
  Welcome to MzScheme v3.99.0.22 [3m], Copyright (c) 2004-2008 PLT Scheme Inc.
  > (format "foo")
  "foo"

And this looks like it should do the same thing, but it fails:

  winooski:~ eli> mz -qIli r5rs srfi/28
  Welcome to MzScheme v3.99.0.22 [3m], Copyright (c) 2004-2008 PLT Scheme Inc.
  > (format "foo")
  stdin::0: compile: bad syntax; function application is not allowed, because no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: (#%top-interaction format "foo")

and actually no applications work.

>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by mflatt at Wed, 09 Apr 2008 17:20:25 -0400
Reason>>> works as intended

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 09 Apr 2008 17:20:25 -0400
Reason>>> In the second example, since -l precedes -i, the -I setting is effectively
ignored.

That is, you get the same thing with

 mzscheme -qli srfi/28

Probably you meant

 mzscheme -qiIl r5rs srfi/28
