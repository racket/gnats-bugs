>Description:
We have an admin account and a limited user account. When logged into the limited user account, the user can make changes to the prefs for their current session but cannot save them. An error message is generated about c:\_LOCKplt-prefs.ss not being writable (sorry, error isn't in front of me).

I could easily be wrong, but I believe this error stems from the fact that the preferences file is saved in the c:\ directory (this is the worst possible place to save it, btw), where the limited user does not have write access. I attempted to give the user write access to the plt-prefs.ss file, but because Dr. Scheme generates a NEW file (the LOCK file), I cannot grant access to it without granting access to the whole c:\ area, which is not acceptable.

Possible solutions:
*Move the prefs file to the PLT folder. Then full access can be granted to the folder.
*Add an option that allows the user to pick the location to save the prefs.
*(Best, IMO) Save the prefs for each user individually in a location where they can change them without manual modification of the directory's rights (in "c:\Documents and Settings\userx\Application Data\PLT" for instance.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a limited user account in XP.
As administrator, install Dr. Scheme. Run through initial setup.
Log in as limited user, open Dr. Scheme.
Change a pref (such as the language), and close Dr. Scheme.
The error should be generated and all changed settings will be lost.

 That's where it will go in the next release.
 
 In the current release, it goes to the user's home directory, as
 determined by the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables. If
 HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH aren't specified, the default is C:\.

 Matthew,
 
 Thanks for the quick response. When is the next release due, and is 
 there a workaround for the current one?

 The only solution I know is to set HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH for the user.
