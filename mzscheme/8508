>Description:
DrScheme runs well, the problem occurs when students want to exit drscheme by
clicking on the exit button. Not the DrScheme exit button, but the window manager
exit button (the cross on the top right corner of the window). 

The computer is completely freezed.

This occurs when running the last version, prior to this test, we were using the 300
version and the problem is the same.

We are using The Suse 10.0 distribution and drscheme has been built from sources
without any problem.

Any help would be appreciated !

PS: we are a french university, drscheme is used by 500 students of our mathematics
and computing science department

 Are you running in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode?
 
 I would guess 32-bit mode, but I ask because we received a similar
 report for a 64-bit configuration, and that problem was apparently
 solved by a library upgrade.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 I'm sorry, I don't know !
 Do you mean DrScheeme do care about that ?
 And if so, may I change something in the configure option ?

 We are using the 32-bit mode.
 I've also tried to install previous versions, the problem is the same.
 
 Installed on a GenToo, everything is ok !
 
 Hum ... I 'm currently stucked.

 The report I have in mind is number 8353:
 
  http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=8353
 
 I see that they were using SUSE 10.0, too, but they only saw problems
 in 64-bit machines, and not on 32-bit machines.
 
 The problem was apparently resolved by a kernel update (not a library
 update, as I suggested before) in December.
 
 Assuming you're up to date with all patches, then I'm stumped for the
 moment. When the whole machine freezes, that has to be an OS bug ---
 though obviously DrScheme might avoid doing something that triggers the
 bug, if we can figure out what that is.
 
 Meanwhile, I can offer the same suggestions as for PR 8353, though these
 are just shots in the dark:
   * try compiling with --disable-gl
   * try setting the PLTNOMZJIT environment variable

Reason>>> sounds like there is no plt bug
