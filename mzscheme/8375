>Description:
Given the following reader:
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~samth/tmp/reader/typed-scheme.ss

The following module works incorrectly after compilation.

#reader "typed-scheme.ss"
(module test-bug mzscheme

  (define-syntax foo
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(_ stx prop-val)
       (equal? (cond [(syntax-property #'stx 'foo) => syntax-object->datum]
                     [else #f])
               prop-val)]))
  
  (define x1 (foo a #f))
  (define x2 (foo #{b PROP foo 5} 5))
  
  (define x3 (quote-syntax #{b PROP foo 5}))
  
  (provide x1 x2 x3)
  
  )

When the module is opened in drscheme, and run, x1 and x2 are both #t, and x3 has a foo syntax property of 5 (as syntax).  When the module is compiled (for example, mzc -k test-bug.scm) and then required, then x1 is #t, x2 is #f, and x3 does not have the foo syntax property.

 More specifically, it's bytecode marshaling that loses the properties.
 That's on purpose.

 Why is this on purpose?  The example wasn't contrived, I'm actually
 encountering this behavior in practice.  What should I do instead?

 Syntax properties are meant for communication at expansion time and
 when using `expand'. (I'm sure this could be documented/explained
 better.)

 See `define-code' in `(lib "code.ss" "texpict")' for an example. To
 preserve information that starts as source location and property
 information, Slideshow's `code' macro expands the syntax to an
 expression that reconstructs it with relevant information restored.
