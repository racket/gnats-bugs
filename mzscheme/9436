>Description:
using version 3.99 the process function creates a cmd.exe window that appears in Windows, where it did not in 3.72.
>How-To-Repeat:
In 3.99 the following creates and displays a cmd.exe window that quickly appears and disappears, in 3.72 the equivalent code does not show the window.

(module dummy mzscheme
  (require scheme/system)  
  ;;; for 3.72
  ;;; (require (lib "process.ss"))
  (let* ((z (process "dir"))
         (stdout (car z)))
    (letrec ((dump 
              (lambda ()
                (let ((s (read-line stdout)))
                  (display s)
                  (unless (eof-object? s)
                    (dump))))))
      (dump))))
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 30 May 2008 15:56:14 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. (I broke it sometime last week.)
Thanks very much for the report!
