>Description:
In the mzc manual, section `Autodetecting Compiled Files for Loading', the sample mzc
   command line is incorrect; the slashes between directory components are missing.
   
It reads:

mzc --extension --destination compiled native i386-linux file.ss

but should read

mzc --extension --destination compiled/native/i386-linux file.ss

this bug is present in both the HTML and PDF versions.

 Bizarre -- looks like I actually typed it that way in TeX.
 
 Fixed.
