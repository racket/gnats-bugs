>Description:
The documentation for get-module-code states:

> (get-module-code module-path-v) - returns a compiled expression for
  the declaration of the module specified by `module-path-v'. The
  `module-path-v' argument is a quoted module path, as for MzScheme's
  `dynamic-require' using the default module path resolver.

However the implementation requires module-path-v be a string, not 
a quoted module path.

Here is a fix that is consistent with how show-import-tree resolves
it's module-path-v argument:
