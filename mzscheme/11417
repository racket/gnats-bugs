>Description:
If you spell DoubleCheck with caps, it doesn't run the property tests. With the "doublecheck" spelling, it does run the tests. I'm using 5.0.1 with Dracula release 14.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run this:
(include-book "DoubleCheck" :dir :teachpacks)
(defun f (x) (1+ x))
(defproperty f-test
  (x :value (random-natural))
  (= (f x)
     (+ x 1)))

Observe that no tests are run.
Change to lower-case d/c, and Run again.

Reason>>> Interaction between #%require and case-insensitive

 This appears to be a problem with Racket's interaction with
 case-insensitive filesystems.  Multiple requires (or include-book, in
 this case) can import the same file, but they will compile it
 separately and thus not share an implementation.  The following
 program illustrates this:
 
 #lang racket/base
 (require (prefix-in lowercase: racket/list)
          (prefix-in uppercase: RACKET/LIST))
 (eq? lowercase:partition
      uppercase:partition)
 
 The call to eq? returns #f.  I don't know if this is a bug in Racket
 or a limitation in filesystem capabilities.  For reference, I see the
 same behavior on Mac OS that Rex sees on Windows.

 Module paths with different case refer to different modules, though
 different paths may turn out to refer to the same source files (which
 can be true for many reasons other than case insensitivity).
 
 Module paths are not normalized with respect to case, because that
 would vary among systems ---- or even among filesystems on the same system.=

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by cce at Wed, 10 Nov 2010 20:09:09 -0500
Reason>>> This is the intended behavior of Racket (and thus Dracula)
when given filenames that differ only by case, because it
can not in general be determined whether they refer to the
same file.  Also note that the original program with
"DoubleCheck" in it is not portable; it would not run on any
Linux system, for instance, because the file as capitalized
does not exist.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by cce at Wed, 10 Nov 2010 20:09:09 -0500
Reason>>> Working as intended, even if not ideal.
