>Description:
Hi, Dunno how easy this would be, but could a function be added which 
restricts the mutablity of a pair? 

I'm thinking about hash-consing cyclic data and I need some way of 
ensuring its immutability.  Any suggestions appreciated - EA

 Not quite, I was originally working a hashconsing function which would
 (ideally) return only immutable values. This is no problem until I
 encounter cyclic lists.  Is there another way to create immutable
 cyclic lists? Thanks - EA

 Ah - there's no way currently to create immutable cyclic data, except
 syntax objects.
