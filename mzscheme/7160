>Description:
Just checked out a fresh copy of the exp tree and attempted to build it from  scratch; installation fails.

$ cd ~/plt
$ cvs -d :ext:cobbe@denali:/proj/scheme/cvs co -P -d exp-src -r exp plt
  ... output elided ...
$ mkdir exp-build
$ cd exp-build
$ ../exp-src/src/configure --prefix=/Users/cobbe/plt/exp
  ... output elided ...
$ make
  ... output elided ...
$ make 3m
  ... output elided ...
$ make install
  ... several lines of output, then the following:
cd ..; cp -r mred/Starter.app /Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/launcher/.
cp: cannot create directory `/Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/launcher/.': No such file or directory
make[4]: *** [install_wx_mac] Error 1
make[3]: *** [install] Error 2
make[2]: *** [mrinstall] Error 2
make[1]: *** [install-normal] Error 2
make: *** [install] Error 2

$ mkdir -p /Users/cobbe/plt/exp/collects/launcher
$ make install
  ... rebuilds .zos and finishes without further errors.

The Makefile needs to ensure that $prefix/collects/launcher exists before trying to copy files into it.

Mac OS X 10.3.7, XCode 1.2 toolchain.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 21 Jan 2005 23:31:44 -0500
Reason>>> mzscheme Makefile problem on OSX (Also see PR7182)


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 24 Nov 2006 03:03:14 -0500
Reason>>> must have been fixed long ago
