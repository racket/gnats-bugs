 This is by design. When a file is compiled, source location
 information is stripped from syntax literals. If you want to preserve
 it, you must extract it during expansion and save it as something
 else.

 Before I submitted this bug report I could not find anything about
 this in the documentation. I went back now and it is obviously there.
 The reason I think was I looked for 'source-location' which does not
 help one get to 'syntax-source' and others (where the information is).
 
 Thanks, Eric
