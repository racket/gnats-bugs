>Description:
I have an ->d contract which is getting the #<unsupplied-arg> value passed to one of the contracts for a non-optional argument.

I apologize for the lack of an easy test case.
>How-To-Repeat:
% svn co -r14643 http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/branches/samth/paths
% ... build this branch ...
% cd paths/collects/typed-scheme
% ../../bin/mzscheme -j test.ss
You get this error:
ormap: expects type <proper list> as 2nd argument, given: #<unsupplied-arg>; other arguments were: #<procedure:LBot?>

Which is pointing to line 67 in collects/typed-scheme/rep/filter-rep.ss
>Fix:
added a use of procedure-reduce-keyword-arity so the thing that comes out of ->d has the right arity and mz's check in the app form catches this.
>Release-Note:
This was a contract violation, but the contract library wasn't written properly, so it was the wrong contract violation.

I guess this should have been a type error, but the type error would have been that ->d does not preserve its input type to its output and that seems quite difficult to get right.

 Stevie: this looks like a problem with define/contract at least at
 first glance. Are you planning to look into it, or shall I?

 I've already looked at it, and I believe it's because build-dep-ctc- 
 deps from scheme/private/contract-arrow.ss takes in the total of the  
 mandatory and optional arguments as one, instead of split apart, so  
 that it can detect whether there are fewer arguments than mandatory  
 arguments and error, instead of filling those arguments with the  
 unsupplied-arg value.
 
 I could go ahead and see if I could fix it, but since there's also the  
 self argument for methods and range arguments for the post-condition,  
 it might be better if you do so.
 
 Just let me know which you'd prefer!
 
 HTH,
 Stevie

 Ah. I see.
 
 Sam: the bug was a missing call to procedure-reduce-keyword-arity. Is
 that something you think that could go into typed scheme (that
 function)? That is, can I write a function that has the type "proc ->
 proc" but where the output's arity should be the same as the inputs,
 and the function is written by making a generic wrapper and then
 calling procedure-reduce-keyword-arity?

 Here's another example, for the record:
 
 ((contract
   (->d ([x any/c] [y any/c]) () [this any/c])
   (=CE=BB (x y) x)
   'pos
   'neg)
  1)
 
 I've added the long since missing to procedure-reduce-keyword-arity
 that should take care of this.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
