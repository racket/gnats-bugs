>Description:
I have some code that used to work with 5.0.1 that now breaks in 5.1 with the error message:

   module-path-index-resolve: "self" index has no resolution: #<module-path-index>

The bugs continues to appear after running "raco planet clear", starting with no preference file and setting PLTCOLLECTS set to ';' . The bugs disappears when either "debugging" or "populate compiled/ directories" is turned off.

This seems to be the same bug as Danny Yoo reported in November:

   http://www.mail-archive.com/users@racket-lang.org/msg02763.html

Hopefully this additional report will help track the bug down.

I reduced the code down to the smallest example that still tickles the bug. See below.
>How-To-Repeat:
---- in file "buggy.rkt" -----
#lang racket

(require "hash-buggy.rkt")

(breaks*)


------ in file "hash-buggy.rkt" ----
#lang racket

(require (for-syntax racket/match))

(provide breaks*)
(define-match-expander breaks*
  void
  (lambda (stx) #'#t))

 This looks related to PR 11730, which I was never able to reduce to 
 something smaller.

 No, this *is* PR 11730.  Which number did you mean?

 Sorry, I meant PR 11363 (module-path-index-resolve error in expr/c 
 violation).
