>Description:
When I try to check mail using SirMail, I get this error
message.  I can't give steps to reproduce, so I hope that this
is enough information to fix the bug.


bytes-length: expects argument of type <byte string>; given #<eof>

 It message causing sirmail to just die, or can you just try again and
 again?
 
 Also, the server is broken, right? SirMail isn't expected to be able to
 connect successfully?

 Sirmail does not die, AFAICT.  The error appears in a dialog, and the  
 application is still responsive.

 That's correct.  My sysadmin sent me log messages from the IMAP  
 server that indicated (with some help from google) that the IMAP  
 index files had become corrupted:
 
 Sep 19 11:31:40 falcon imap(clements): [ID 265587 mail.crit] file  
 mail-tree-redblack.c: line 186 (rb_left_rotate): assertion failed:  
 (x != RBNULL)
 
 ... so I moved the existing index out of the way, and things seem to  
 be working again. SirMail can now get the list of messages correctly.

 I think that the behavior you see from sirmail is the expected
 behavior in that case. 
 
 Feel free to make it better! :)
