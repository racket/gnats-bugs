>Description:
write-resource et al. depend on MrEd.  That means that you can't 
write MzScheme programs that use string-constants.

I'm guessing the reason for this is that under Unix, write-resource
uses the xrdb mechanism, which isn't available unless you have 
X installed.  Even so, it's plausible that you have X, but want to
write MzScheme programs.

Maybe write-resource should use ndbm or something, or just use 
S-expressions.

>How-To-Repeat:
write a Mz program with write-resource
