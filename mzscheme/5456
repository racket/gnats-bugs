When I try to use the example macro in the documentation, I get an error.

Seemed a bit intimidating for a newbie to try and debug...

 This is a known bug in version 103p1. You cannot use the debug or
 teaching languages and macros. Your best bet is to upgrade to 200.

 I was successful in defining this macro under both Solaris and Windows
 using DrScheme 103p1:
 
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 103p1.

 My guess is that something's wrong with your installation.  Perhaps you
 didn't uninstall an older version before installing 103p1?
