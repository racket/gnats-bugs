>Description:
Running the file "example1.rkt" from this repository: https://github.com/veer-public/Predicate-Dispatch/ (at time c97fc600fc682c0b98feb02e92a0e95b2847b7ae) in DrRacket with debugging on causes the error:

compile: unbound identifier in the transformer environment (and no #%app syntax transformer is bound) in: #%require

Without debugging, the error goes away.
