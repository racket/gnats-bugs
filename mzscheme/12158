>Description:
The system*/exit-code function claims that it returns the exit code of the given process, but it appears to return 256 times the exit code.  I have seen this done elsewhere with the low-order byte used to store the number of any signal that may have caused termination.  Anyway, system*/exit-code should either strip off these bits or correctly document them.

 This worked up to v5.1.  The problem is probably that the code returns
 the raw status, but according to the man page it should instead return
 something like
 
   WIFEXITED(status) ? WEXITSTATUS(status) : ...
 
 where the `...' part is possibly just the raw status, or something
 else.  It looks like in case of crashes etc the status is the same as
 it was, so just
 
   WIFEXITED(status) ? WEXITSTATUS(status) : status
 
 might make sense.  (It would be nice to make the rest of the
 information available via the subprocess interface somehow to make it
 more robust...)
