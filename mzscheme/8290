>Description:
FreeBSD installs third party applications and libraries under /usr/local/.

PLT Scheme's "configure" scheme fails to detect the presence of -lpng and -ljpeg under /usr/local:

... from configure output ...
checking png.h usability... no
checking png.h presence... no
checking for png.h... no
no libpng headers installed; building from PLT copy
checking jpeglib.h usability... no
checking jpeglib.h presence... no
checking for jpeglib.h... no
no libjpeg headers installed; building from PLT copy
... end-snip ...

However these headers and libraries exist on the system:

% ls /usr/local/include/{png,jpeg}*h
/usr/local/include/jpegint.h    /usr/local/include/jpeglib.h    
/usr/local/include/png.h        /usr/local/include/pngconf.h
% ls /usr/local/lib/lib{png,jpeg}*
/usr/local/lib/libjpeg.a        /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.so
/usr/local/lib/libpng.a         /usr/local/lib/libpng.so.5
/usr/local/lib/libjpeg.la       /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.so.9
/usr/local/lib/libpng.so
>How-To-Repeat:
Install 'png' and 'jpeg' using the ports system, and run
"plt/src/configure".

 I'm not sure of the right way to improve the configure script. Any
 suggestions?
 
 The configure script could certainly add -I/usr/local/include and
 -L/usr/local/include to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS when the target platform is
 determined to be FreeBSD. I've had to do things like that for other
 platforms, but it feels like the wrong solution.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 It isn't very clear what the right way is.
 
 In FreeBSD there are actually three locations that come into play
 when installing DrScheme:
 
  o the location to which DrScheme will install to, set by --prefix.
  o $LOCALBASE (defaults to /usr/local) where non-X11 binaries
    reside.  So, -liconv, -lpng and -ljpeg would reside under
    $LOCALBASE/lib.
  o $X11BASE (defaults to /usr/X11R6) specifies where X11 binaries would
    reside.
 
 X11BASE can be handled using configure options --x11-includes and
 --x11-libraries.  Perhaps a more generic option pair, "--local-includes"
 and "--local-libraries" which accumulate their arguments would
 suffice to cover the x11 and /usr/local cases.
 
 In the FreeBSD port, I'm setting CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and CFLAGS
 explicitly on the command line (which works).  However the current
 behavior of "configure" may still affect someone who is building
 DrScheme outside the ports system.

 Koshy

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
