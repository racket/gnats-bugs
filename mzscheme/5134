>Description:
Help Desk only finds the first doc directory if you have multiple collects with their own doc directories.  So, for example, if there is a system wide doc directory (/usr/lib/plt/collects/doc) and user doc directory (~/projects/collects) documentation placed in the user directory will not be included amongst the list of installed manuals by Help Desk.

This behaviour occurs because Help Desk uses collection-path (in manuals.ss) which only returns the first matching path that it finds.

Possible fixes:
1. Change collection-path to return a list of all matches.  This seems like the most consistent fix but could break a lot of code
2. Create a new function collection-path* that returns a list of all matches.  This fixes the problem but only in code that is changed
3. Its not a bug, its a feature. It doesn't make a lot of sense to have the same software installed in multiple places to perhaps collection-path returning the first match does make sense for most situations.  However it does make sense to have multiple doc directories, so perhaps documentation should be handled in a different way.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a collects directory and set the appropriate environmental variables to have PLT Scheme use that directory
2. Create a doc directory within collects
3. Create a sub directory test/ within doc
4. Create a file index.htm in collects/doc/test with title "Test"
5. Open Help Desk.  The test manual should be but isn't listed under "Tools, Libraries and Extensions"
6. Move collects/doc/test to the first (PLT installed) collects directory.  Reopen Help Desk and the manual will appear

 I'll take option #3.
 
 I've given this some thought before, and my conclusion was that
 sub-collections that are meant to be extensible are a bad idea. "doc"
 is the main place where this shows up; "games" is another.
 
 Robby's already planning to revise the way documentation is installed
 for v201. We can fix "games", then, too. :)
 
 One more thing to fix in v201: if a user has multiple collection
 directories, then the user should be able to choose where a collection
 .plt is unpacked. (Currently, collections are always unpacked to the
 main PLT directory, roughly speaking.)
