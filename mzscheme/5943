>Description:
class.ss `send' analogs for `map' and `for-each' might be
appropriate additions to the standard class.ss API.

As an example, below are two naive ad hoc syntax
definitions I'm using for my immediate need.  They do not
support the full `send' syntax.

(define-syntax (send-map stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    ((_ objects arg ...)
     (syntax (map (lambda (o) (send o arg ...)) objects)))))

(define-syntax (send-for-each stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    ((_ objects arg ...)
     (syntax (for-each (lambda (o) (send o arg ...)) objects)))))

 Be careful with those macros -- you are evaluating the arguments
 multiple times, which could be confusing (or expensive). You probably
 want something like this:
 
 (define-syntax (send-map stx)
   (syntax-case stx ()
     ((_ objects method-name arg ...)
      (identifier? (syntax method-name))
      (with-syntax ([(arg-name ...) (generate-temporaries (syntax (arg ...)))])
       (syntax
        (let ([arg-name arg] ...)
          (map (lambda (o) (send o method-name arg-name ...)) objects))))))))
 
 instead (WARNING: untested code above)

 D'oh.  Thanks.  There should be a "cooling-off period" (or "waking-up
 period") before bug reports get submitted.
 
 But standard `send-map' and `send-for-each' would still be nice.
