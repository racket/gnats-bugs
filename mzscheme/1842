>Description:
If I run the MysterX demo in MzScheme 103.5, and click 
on the calendar more than once, I eventually get an error about 
not being able to retrieve a COM interface.

If I hit <RETURN> in the REPL, I don't get the error, 
presumably because that unblocks some Windows event.
This suggests that something in MzScheme has changed recently, 
something having to do with I/O and Windows events.  

I tried recompiling the latest MysterX code under 103 (not 103.5)
and running the demo in 103.  The error does not occur.

The MysterX demo runs fine in DrScheme 103.5.
>How-To-Repeat:
In MzScheme 103.5, load mxdemo.ss in the MysterX collection.

Click on the calendar.  The words "Click on the calendar"
in the control panel window should get a blue background,
then go back to white.  Click on the calendar again.
