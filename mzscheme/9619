>Description:
In Guide: PLT Scheme, Section 2.3, the example about foldl says:

    (foldl (lambda (v elem)
      ...

But according to manual of foldl, proc's last argument is the combined
return value, so this example should say:

    (foldl (lambda (elem v)
      ...

I think it's also what the author mean and what the reader expect.

Reason>>> fixed in SVN

In the paragraph explaining why some Schemers rarely use
`fold', I almost included a sentence noting that it's
difficult to remember the order of `fold''s arguments. :)

Thanks for the report!
