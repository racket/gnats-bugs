 That's because pretty-big has the graphical stuff.
 
 You need to:
 
   mred -L plt-pretty-big.ss lang
 
 or, even better, something like this:
 
   mred -mvqL plt-pretty-big.ss lang -r myscript.ss

 Isn't Pretty Big a graphical language that uses MrEd?

 Ah, thanks paul & robby -- i'd been thinking the library would load 
 the mred libraries -- but sounds like that's not what mred is.
 
 Anyway, now using "mred ..." -- Problem solved!
