>Description:
I have compiled mzscheme (unix code) on Windows 2000. I used the GNU toolchain to build it.

The binaries built correctly and installed properly on my system, but when I try to run mzc it spews out an error:
mzc --exe skroc.exe skroc.ss
mzc version 360, Copyright (c) 2004-2006 PLT Scheme Inc.
copy-file: cannot open source file; cannot copy: /usr/lib/plt/starter to: /src/teraterpreter/tvm/skroc/skroc.exe

(note I am trying to build tvm, the teraterpreter)

I actually have the file /usr/lib/plt/starter.exe but it is balking because it does not assume that starter == starter.exe on cygwin.

 It should be noted that one can use transparent_exe in the CYGWIN
 envrionment variable.

 Note that this should be used with care as it is an experimental feature.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Sun, 15 Apr 2007 08:01:17 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN by including the "exe" suffix for mc --exe operation.

It's possible that a better fix would be to install "starter" without
the ".exe" suffix. It's also possible that a suffix should be added to
generated executables; currently, adding a suffix breaks things,
because Cygwin strips the "exe" suffix in argv[0] and the binary
can't find itself. The PR remains open for those reasons.



State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:39 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
