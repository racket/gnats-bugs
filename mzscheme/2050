>Description:
The documentation for identifier-binding claims that if it
returns a pair, the car position is a module path index, but
sometimes it returns a symbol, as shown below.

Also, the docs section 11.7 of the mzscheme manual, ``Expanded
Module Path Information'' is very dense in the first paragraph.
This sentence in particular:

  A module path index that returns #f for its path
  (and base module path index) represents the expanded 
  or compiled module declaration from which the 
  information was drawn. 

doesn't make any sense to me. What is "the information"? 
>How-To-Repeat:
I would have expected the last expression in the program below
to return #t (based on the docs), but it doesn't.

(module n mzscheme (provide f) (define f 1))

(define stx
  (expand #'(module m mzscheme (require n) f)))

(define-values (fstx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(module nam lang (xxx yyy require-stmt f))
     (values (syntax f))]))

(define mpi (car (identifier-binding fstx)))
(module-path-index? mpi)
