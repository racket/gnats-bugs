mzscheme -x (49/14) on nw
>Description:
According to the documentation, exn:i/o:filesystem has a field called
pathname.  Presumably this gives the path of the file whose access was
attempted.  However, the value given, for open-input-file, is
"open-input-file".
>How-To-Repeat:
new-world ~/Z> mzscheme -x
Welcome to MzScheme version 49/14, Copyright (c) 1995-97 Matthew Flatt
> (with-handlers ((exn:i/o? (lambda (exn) (pretty-print exn))))
(open-input-file "foo.frob"))
#(struct:exn:i/o:filesystem:filename
  "open-input-file: cannot open input file: \"foo.frob\" in directory \"/a/santa/aten/shriram/Z\" (2)"
  #<void>
  "open-input-file")
>Fix:
Fixed exn construction for next version.
