>Description:
Build problems under Windows NT due to incomplete .zip distribution and Cygnus gcc compiler.

.zip lacks plt/bin directory, hence missing mzc, archsys, etc.  Also missing plt/install.

Also, archsys needs to check for generic uname in path not just
in /bin/uname or /usr/bin/uname.  archsys needs a cygwin*) case.

mzc and mzscheme behave strangely.  mzc hung (have not investigated).
mzscheme under the bash shell experiences i/o echoing problems.

The dynexample does not complete without mzc so I do not know it's
status.

 Gregory,
 
 	Is this problem with the DrScheme 53 release, or an alpha
 release?
