>Description:
If two modules use c-lambda forms and both modules are compiled
in the same invocation of mzc, compilation of the second module
will fail with the following error:

"c-lambda-multi-file.scm": 
 [?,?]: Error:  C compiler did not complete successfully
compile-extension: 
./c-lambda-multi-file.c:18: redefinition of `mzc_cffi_0'
./c-lambda-multi-file.c:7: `mzc_cffi_0' previously defined here

This happens even if the two modules are in different files. The 
mzc_cffi_X functions generated for the first module are repeated
at the beginning of the second module's C file.

The problem does not seem to occur if the modules are compiled 
with separate invocations of mzc.

>How-To-Repeat:
a.scm:
(module a mzscheme
  (require (lib "cffi.ss" "compiler"))
  (define fa (c-lambda () void "return;"))
  (provide fa))

b.scm:
(module b mzscheme
  (require (lib "cffi.ss" "compiler"))
  (require "a.scm")
  (define fb (c-lambda () void "printf(\"here\\n\");"))
  (provide fb))

If the files are compiled with the command line
    mzc --save-temps -e a.scm b.scm
then the error occurs, and compilation fails (C code is emitted,
but cannot be compiled).

If the files are compiled with the command line
    mzc --save-temps -e a.scm; mzc --save-temps -e b.scm
the compilation is successful and the extensions function as
expected.
