Solaris
>Description:
1. Definition of GET_FIN_LOCK (in salloc.c) is syntactically incorrect 
   (the first operand of a comma operator is empty), if REGISTER_SO is 
   defined as empty.
2. Deadlock in scheme_get_chars. If a port passed to scheme_get_chars is
   not a regular file, scheme_get_chars uses scheme_getc. scheme_getc tries
   to lock the port, which is already locked by scheme_get_chars.

>How-To-Repeat:
1. ./configure --enable-osthreads ; make
2. echo "(read-string 3)123" | mzscheme

 Thanks - these bugs (and one more) are fixed in the newly exp-tagged
 source for 103. (There may be additional minor changes for the final
 release.)
