>Description:
	Complex constants involving inf.0 (e.g., +inf.0+1i) dont't
parse, and they should. Complex numbers with +nan.0 parse, but don't
create the right value (they should all be the same as +nan.0).
>How-To-Repeat:
	+inf.0+1i
>Fix:
	Note: this bug will be fixed for 50, not 49

State-Changed-Why:
Decided to fix it for 49, after all, since the release was delayed.
I decided that +inf.0+1i shouldn't parse after all; instead,
regard +inf.0, -inf.0, +nan.0, and -nan.0 as constants that are
not part of the syntax for complex numbers. This was basically
a decision of convenience, and it seems extremely unlikely that
anyone will care.

In addition, I made the test for +inf.0, etc. case-insensitive.
