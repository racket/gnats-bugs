>Description:
I have a long-running process that calls tcp-connect/enable-break
every 3 to 60 seconds, using one of two hostnames (it's monitoring
two different HTTP servers).  After an hour or three, all
tcp-connect/enable-break requests begin failing with the
"host not found" error.

It retries every 20 seconds, but continues to get the error, even
though the hostnames are resolveable from other processes at the
same time.  Exiting the "mzscheme" process and restarting the
program works for another hour or few, til the problem reappears.

Uninformed guesses are: (1) my program is exhausting some resource
such as file descriptors, preventing the DNS lookup from working;
(2) the DNS lookup code is hitting a transient error and corrupting
a cache that is never updated; (3) the DNS record hits its TTL and
somehow the DNS lookup is erroring instead of doing a new lookup
from the servers.  I can't disclose which two hosts it was, but
there is nothing very special about their DNS setup.  I glanced at
network.c, but don't know enough to debug.

If it'd be helpful, I can run a program that reproduces the error
on my machine.  Just let me know what information it should
capture when the error occurs.

 Is it possible to do whatever your program does more frequently, to
 check whether it makes DNS lookups fail sooner? (Or maybe limit desc
 to half its normal value?)

 This is probably a dumb question, but do you close both the ports from  
 tcp-connect?
 Could an exception keep the ports from closing?  Does using a custodian  
 to close ports
 close other ports, say to a DNS server?  Do other tcp-connects from the  
 same mzscheme
 process work (using IP addresses)?  Does netstat or "lsof -i" (under  
 unix) indicate many network connections?
 
 I hope this helps,
 
 Paul

 OK, this bug report can be closed -- it's user error.
 
 I should've thought to look at normal resource usage (before the error
 occurs):
 
     % netstat -t | grep -c CLOSE_WAIT
     416
 
 I'll fix my code to religiously close ports.
 
 Thanks to you and mflatt for your help.
