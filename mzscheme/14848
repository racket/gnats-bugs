>Description:
When updating the package list in DrRacket via File/Package Manager/Available from Catalog/Update Package List, DrRacket spends many minutes diskbound [1], writing approx. 200k-400k per second on my machine, and not using significant CPU.

The cause seems to be excessive reopening and reinitialization of the catalog sqlite database. For most packages in the main official catalog, the code repeats the following steps three times:

 - open the database
 - ~CREATE IF NOT EXISTS three tables
 - start a transaction
 - delete a single row
 - insert a single row
 - commit the transaction
 - close the database

One solution might be to lift out the DB open/table-setup/close steps to a parameter, so that an existing open DB handle could be used if one exists. It might be even better to put *all* the deletes/inserts into one large transaction, though then the absence of transaction retry logic might be a problem.

[1] about 3.5 mins on my machine; about 5 mins on Asumu's machine

Update the package list using the package manager GUI in DrRacket.

 Sounds like a good example for optimization coaching!

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by mflatt@racket-lang.org at Wed, 26 Nov 2014 09:13:00 -0500
Reason>>> A commit by mflatt@racket-lang.org was marked as relevant
  http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/dd02cf8952
  | pkg catalog-update: install updates as a single transaction
  | 
  | Relevant to PR 14848


State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Wed, 26 Nov 2014 09:15:28 -0500
Reason>>> My machines don't have the minutes-long behavior, but I've pushed changes 
along the suggested lines, and it cut the DB time on my machine from 2 seconds 
to 1 second. Let me know whether the change improves performance on your 
machine.

 Thank you Matthew -- that fixes the problem. Now updating the catalog
 completes in a handful of seconds.
