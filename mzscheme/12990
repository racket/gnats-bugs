>Description:
Using racket 5.2.1 (installed as here: http://chakra-linux.org/ccr/pkgbuild_view.php?p=racket), using 'raco distribute' (or mzc --exe-dir) to package an executable results in the program receiving two additional command-line arguments when running.

Haven't yet tested with 5.3.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Write a program doing something like
 (print current-command-line-arguments)
2. Compile with 'raco exe SOURCE' (or 'mzc --exe NAME SOURCE'), run this program with some arguments, and check the correct set of arguments is printed.
3. Use 'raco distribute DIR EXEC' (or mzc) to package the executable. Run the packaged version with arguments. Note that the arguments vector now includes two additional arguments: '#("" "")

 Further testing: this still happens on 5.3. It also depends on the exact
 program; this fails (extra parameters):
 
 (module
  bad-cmd-args
  mzscheme
  (print (current-command-line-arguments)))
 
 However this works (at least with 5.3):
 
 #lang racket
 
 (print (current-command-line-arguments))
