>Description:
When starting anything (mr/mz apps) and the current
directory does not exist, I get the error below.
The least that should be done is to print a warning
and start from the home directory...

  shell-init: could not get current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
  shell-init: could not get current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
  path->complete-path: second argument is not a complete path: "."
  standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found: "drscheme" in any of: ()

   === context ===
  cloop
  standard-module-name-resolver
>How-To-Repeat:
1. open two terminals

2. In the first one:
     mkdir .../foo
     cd .../foo

3. In the second one:
     rmdir .../foo

4. Back in the first one: run mzscheme, get an error
