Reason>>> This looks like a bad interaction between `syntax-local-lift-expression'
and partial expansion of the module body (by `#%module-begin') to
insert printing of top-level expressions.

 That's probably a contract error message. You can avoid it like this:
 
 #lang slideshow
 (define mytext text)
 (begin0 (cc-superimpose (text "Text!")))
 
 I can't seem to make a simple example with just contracts, however.

 I'm pretty sure it's in the expansion of `define', and in the partial
 expansion that `scheme/base' performs to insert printing around
 non-definitions in the module body.

State changed from "analyzed" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 07 Dec 2007 09:34:19 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed in SVN. The bug was in using the wrong `#%app' in modbeg.ss.
