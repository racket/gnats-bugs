>Description:
Attempting to read a compiled expression that has been converted to a string raises a reader error, even through read-accept-compiled is #t.

(I discovered this while exploring mzscheme's treatment of uninterned symbols in serialized compiled code, not through mzc or any other PLT tool.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Evaluate the following program:

  (define (roundtrip cc)
    (parameterize ((read-accept-compiled #t))
      (parameterize ((current-input-port (open-input-string (format "~a" cc))))
        (read))))

  (roundtrip (compile #'5))

It raises this error:

  read (compiled): ill-formed code [../src/read.c:4754]

 Write to bytes (probably using `open-output-bytes') instead of a
 string, and use `open-input-bytes' instead of `open-input-string'.
 Otherwise, you're running into UTF-8-decoding where you don't want it.
