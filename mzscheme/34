>Description:
I have a feeling MzScheme isn't translating ' into #%quote but into
quote instead.  When I wrote

		       (#%raise (,make-undefined
				  ,(format "Undefined value in ~s" real-v)
				  ((#%debug-info-handler))
				  ',v))

inside ariesu.ss I got an unbound identifier `quote' error at the
location where this code ran.  When I changed it to

		       (#%raise (,make-undefined
				  ,(format "Undefined value in ~s" real-v)
				  ((#%debug-info-handler))
				  (#%quote ,v)))

it ran fine.

State-Changed-Why: 

This is true and intensionally so. After think about it a while,
I was uncomfortable making the *reader* diverge from R4RS by coverting
' to #%quote. I remain convinced that quote is the right choice.
