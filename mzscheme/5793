 this appears to be a problem with the moddep.ss library in the syntax
 collection:
 
 [taitung] ~/cvs/plt/collects% mzscheme -q
 Welcome to MzScheme version 202.1, Copyright (c) 1995-2002 PLT
 > (define false #f)
 > (require (lib "moddep.ss" "syntax"))
 > (resolve-module-path-index (module-path-index-join "b.ss" false) (build-path (quote same)))
 build-path: expects type <string or 'up or 'same> as 1st argument, given: relative; other arguments were: "b.ss"
 
 I get that module-path-index from the syntax-source-module primitive.
