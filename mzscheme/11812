>Description:
Dear PLT,

If struct b is a subtype of struct a, then the former inherits the fields of the latter, as advertised.  But those fields are inaccessible during a struct-copy of type b.  Jon Rafkind suggests this is a bug, so I submit this report.  Please see "Steps to reproduce."

Thank you,
Anthony West
>How-To-Repeat:
(struct super (id))
(struct sub super ())

(define p (super 13))
(define b (sub 100))

> (struct-copy super p (id 14))
#<super>
> (struct-copy sub b (id 101))
stdin::168: struct-copy: accessor name not associated with the given structure type at: sub-id in: (struct-copy sub b (id 101))
