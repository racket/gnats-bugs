>Description:
If I provide a value that does not match its flat contract, and execute the module in the DrScheme module language, I get an error message that incorrectly reports the offending name to be "here", and provides no source location for the error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Executing the following code:

(module bug mzscheme
  (require (lib "contract.ss"))
  (define num 'five)
  (provide/contract
   [num number?])
  )

gives me the following message:

,/Users/cce/Projects/research/code/equiv/bug broke the contract number? on here; expected <number?>, given: five
>Fix:
The wrong argument was being passed to the `contract' form for the first order check (it had the right type).
>Release-Note:
This wasn't a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.
