>Description:
The appended program fails in drracket with 

  let: unbound identifier at phase 2;
   also, no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: let

It runs fine in racket. Tested with current nightly.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket

(require (for-syntax racket))

(begin-for-syntax
  (define-syntax (a stx)
    (syntax-case stx () 
      [(_) #'123])))

 One more important hint to reproduce it:
 
 You have to select "Debugging and profiling" in the lkanguage settings for  
 racket.
 
 i.e. have the following line in ~/.racket/racket-prefs.rktd :
 
 (plt:framework-pref:drracket:language-settings ((-32768) (#6(#t print  
 mixed-fraction-e #f #t debug/profile) (default) #0() "#lang racket\n" #f  
 #t ((main) (test)))))
 
 Otherwise it won't show up.
 This error can be reproduced with version 5.2.1 and every 5.3.x version.
