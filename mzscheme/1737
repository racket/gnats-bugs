>Description:
Believe it or not, the bizarre 
code below is actually legal in graphical
full scheme (without debuggin). 
But, in graphical debug mode, 
the code is not syntactically well-formed.

We should bring these guys into agreement
and add this kind of thing to the
mzscheme test suite.
>How-To-Repeat:
(define c%
  (class object% ()
    (public
      [get-y
       (lambda () 11)])
    (sequence (super-init))))

(define d%
  (class c% ([x (begin (super-init) (get-y))])
    (inherit get-y)
    (public
      [get-x
       (lambda () x)])))

(send (make-object d%) get-x) 

; = 11 in mzscheme

; in zodiac, super-init
; and, presumably, get-y are free
; in the second expression.
