To port this stuff to OpenBSD-2.7 (current release) on the 386 platform

I had to do the following:

1. Add a clause to mzscheme/gc/gcconfig.h

 for OpenBSD and i386

2. Change the function file_char_ready in mzscheme/src/port.c

replacing

# ifdef HAS_STANDARD_IOB
  if (fp->_cnt)
    return 1;
# endif

by


#ifndef __OpenBSD__
# ifdef HAS_STANDARD_IOB
  if (fp->_cnt)
    return 1;
# endif
#else
  if (fp -> _r)
    return 1;
#endif


since OpenBSD has a somewhat different io buffer (so it can support encrypted file systems).

 Thanks for the porting suggestions, but I'm puzzled that the current
 configuration headers don't already do the right thing. Maybe the
 pre-processor tests are out-of-date?

 Line 194 of gcconfig has the following:
 
  # if defined(__OpenBSD__) && defined(i386)
  #   define I386
  #   define OPENBSD
  #   define mach_type_known
  # endif
 
 Not right?

 [...]
 
 sconfig.h has an OpenBSD configuration that starts as follows:
 
  # if defined(__OpenBSD__) && defined(i386)
 
  # define SCHEME_PLATFORM_LIBRARY_SUBPATH "i386-openbsd"
 
  # include "uconfig.h"
  # undef HAS_STANDARD_IOB
 
  # define HAS_BSD_IOB
 
 which should have taken care of the IOB problem, but only if the
 `defined(__OpenBSD__) && defined(i386)' test is right.
 
 Any information you can provide about why these configurations didn't
 work would be appreciated.
