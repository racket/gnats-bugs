>Description:
The 'continuation-mark-set->context' procedure should accept an optional prompt tag argument.

This seems to be the right way for debugging tools (such as SchemeUnit) to get "clean" primitive stack traces. It would seem to provide a better way of cutting off primitive stack traces than DrScheme currently uses.

(This depends, of course, on the resolution of PR 9306.)

 Fundamentally, you can't get a "clean" stack trace from
 `continuation-mark-set->context'. It's meant as an approximation; it
 doesn't work currently on x86_64 at all (need to eventually read DWARF
 info out of the binary), and the implementation doesn't actually use
 continuation marks when the JIT is used. So, it intentionally doesn't
 take a prompt tag.
 
 I need to fix the docs to clarify all of this, though.
