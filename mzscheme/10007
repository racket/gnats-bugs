>Description:
Hi! I run DrScheme 4.1.3 under Vista. It crashes constantly at various stages. Sometimes it does during the start-up, when you still see the splash-screen. It crashes very often during run-time and extremally often during debugging. It would be hard for me to pinpoint the exact time and place of crashes as they happen every so often without any particular (i.e. visible) reason. I would also be careful with saying that it crashes more often while debugging than while starting-up. Last time, for example, it crashed 5 times (!) in a row trying to start up (each time at a different point). Here there is the most recent error information given by Vista debugger:
