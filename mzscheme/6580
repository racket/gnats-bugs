>Description:
Seems like if there is no output-port given to a regexp-match over a port, then
it makes more sense to make it behave like regexp-match/fail-without-reading does.
So maybe it's better to have this as a default?  -- It doesn't make sense to use
an output port with the .../fail-without... version, and if you don't specify an
output port for a normal regexp-match, then when you get #f you can just abandon
whatever you did immediately if you want to get the current behavior so it seems
like the .../fail-without... is a more useful default in this case.

 Ugh, maybe I'm stuck with thinking of "^..." regexps, where it
 wouldn't be expensive (but obviously basing a default on that is a bad
 idea)...
 
 So how about leaving the /fail-without-reading version in string.ss
 but --
 * Giving it a friendlier name (since the long name makes it look like
   this is some obscure exotic case), something like
   `regexp-match-port' or `regexp-match*' or `regexp-match+'
 * Making it accept the extra output-port flag and use the built-in
   regexp-match if that is given
 ?
 
 I'm not sure about the second one, maybe the overloading is too
 much...  But a better name would definitely help.
 
 (BTW, I just committed a fix to string.ss -- this function would fail
 if there were some subpatterns that didn't match so you get #f instead
 of an (int . int) thing.)

 The point of matching on ports is to be able to throw away non-matching
 text quickly, instead of peeking (and saving the stream in memory,
 usually) until a match is found.
 
 The /fail-without-reading version may be more useful sometimes, but
 it's potentially much more expensive.

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:16:40 -0500
Reason>>> I think that you said at some point that it would be good 
to document this, if not then it should be closed.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 15:56:26 -0500
Reason>>> `regexp-try-match' at least helps with a better
name, and I think we're very unlikely to change
further at this point
