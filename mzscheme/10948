Responsible changed from "nobody" to "sstrickl" by sstrickl at Tue, 01 Jun 2010 13:02:09 -0400
Reason>>> I've seen the symptoms, and so I have a good idea of where to look for the 
problem.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by sstrickl at Tue, 01 Jun 2010 13:02:09 -0400
Reason>>> I've looked over Matthias's shoulder.

 Just to make it clear to me (and others who may read this) about what's =
 going on here, this version doesn't use contracts, and shows the =
 expected result and actual result (in the comment):
 
 #lang racket/load
 
 (module test racket
 
  (define c%
    (class object%=20
      (define/public (m x) (cons 2 x))
      (super-new)))
 
  (provide c%))
 
 (module test2 racket
  (require 'test)
 
  (define d%
    (class c%
      (inherit [superm m])
      (define/public (k) (superm "no way"))
      (define/override (m x) (cons 1 x))
      (super-new)))
 
  (displayln (send (new d%) k)))
 
 ;; Notice that we get (cons 1 "no way"), instead of (cons 2 "no way"), =
 as you might expect.
 ;; That means we're getting d%'s m for superm, instead of c%'s.
 (require 'test2)
