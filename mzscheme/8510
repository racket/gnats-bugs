>Description:
With x86_64 Linux on a Pentium D (dual core, EM64T) and the 3m version from plt-clean.tgz, "make install" fails because of a segmentation fault when it starts compiling .zos.  The x86_64 cgc version does not have this happen and it successfully installs.  The x86_64 3m mzscheme-only version does not have this happen and it successfully installs (after fixing bug #8509), I'm guessing because it doesn't include the "browser" package or any other packages that might bork on the same seg fault.  I have saved the output of "configure; make; make install" if anyone wants it.

 Can you try with 369.7 (either from the SVN repository, or from the
 pre-release download page when it becomes available)?
 
 It works for me on x86_64, both with and without shared libraries, and
 when installing with the full set of collections in SVN.
 
 However, I did not yet rewind to v369.6 to check that version on
 x86_64. Also, while v369.7 fixes several memory-management bugs, I
 don't immediately see how any of them would have caused the crash you
 see.
 
 So, I'm cautiously pessimistic that v369.7 will solve the problem, but
 I'm not sure what else to try at the moment.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 369.7 plt-clean.tgz (with the same configure flags I used before) crashes at the same point:

 I just built 369.7 with --disable-shared instead (other flags the same as before) and it did not
 crash and it installed fine.

 However, with the --disable-shared 369.7 I just built, the mzscheme tests crash:

 Oops --- I need to fix that test, which doesn't work right for x86_64.
 I forgot that I had commented it out on my machine.

 Thanks --- I was able to reproduce the crash by following your
 directions exactly.
 
 It took me all day to track down, but the problem is relatively simple
 to fix.
 
 Under 3m, JIT-generated code is written to malloc()-allocated memory,
 because malloc()ed memory doesn't move. On platforms where malloc()ed
 memory is not automatically executable, the JIT uses mprotect() to make
 the code-containing page executable. (This is a bit of a hack, since
 mprotect() is not guaranteed to work on malloc()-allocated memory, but
 that's not a problem in practice.)
 
 The JIT tries to avoid excessive mprotect() calls by remembering what it
 recently made executable. The idea is that if a page has been made
 executable recently, then it doesn't need to be made executable again.
 
 Of course, JITted code can become unreferenced, and so a finalizer
 calls free(). As it turns out, the malloc() on x86_64 Linux is smart
 enough to shrink the heap via brk() when a large block of recently
 allocated memory is free()ed. It expands the heap with brk() again if
 it needs more space.
 
 Shrinking the heap and then re-expanding it with brk() means that
 execute permission is lost on pages that were temporarily gone. What if
 the temporarily-gone page was recently made executable by the JIT? The
 JIT doesn't know that the page lost its execute permission, and so it
 doesn't get applied if new code is written to the page.
 
 The solution is simply to flush the JIT's information about recently
 mprotect()ed pages when code is free()ed.
 
 Fixed in SVN.
 
 Matthew
