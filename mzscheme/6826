tcp-connect fails on Windows XP, DrScheme 206p1 with the following error message:

. tcp-connect: connection to www.drscheme.org, port 80 failed (at step 2: Função incorreta.; errno=1)

I'm using the brazilian portuguese version of Windows XP, the error function in portuguese ("Função incorreta.") means "incorrect function"
Tried with various other values for the parameters, got allways the same result.

(I couldn't send the bug report using the help desk interface; the same
error occurred)
>How-To-Repeat:
(tcp-connect "www.drscheme.org" 80)

; server and port can actually be any value

 The errno and error text is bogus. I've fixed that for the next version.
 
 "Step 2" is when DrScheme is trying to get information from Windows
 about the "tcp" protocol. This step doesn't normally fail, especially
 since the host lookup succeeded already in step 1.
 
 I'm stumped for the moment, but I'll look into this more.

Reason>>> haven't been able to reproduce the problem,
and we've had no other reports along these lines,
so progress looks unlikely
