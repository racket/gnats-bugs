>Description:
Using the Mac OS source distribution available from www.drscheme.org, "make install" fails with an error about ./../man (relative to the plt/src directory) being missing.  Creating an empty directory with this name allows "make install" to proceed.
>How-To-Repeat:
(In plt/src directory in unpacked v208 Mac OS tarball)
./configure --prefix=/path
make
make install
