>Description:
The program below causes a seg-fault under Windows 2000,
using MzScheme or MrEd v200alpha17.

[I'm submitting this report from Solaris because my Help configuration
is in disarray.]

In Solaris, the program just generates an exception, as expected,
since the SMTP server does not exist.
>How-To-Repeat:
(require (lib "smtp.ss" "net"))
