>Description:
Running DrScheme on an X86-Darwin machine gave me this error message:

open-output-file: cannot open output file: "/Users/raymond/Library/Preferences/.LOCK.plt-prefs.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

My home directory looks like a a regular Unix one and not an OS X one, so there is no Library. I would say that for all XonX versions, the Unix behavior should trump the OS X behavior.
