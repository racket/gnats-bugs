>Description:
Loading Jim Bullard's IE control into a 
MysterX document causes a bad pointer deference
on (exit).

This doesn't appear to happen with any other COM
objects so far, so it may be the control itself.

It's not the exit-handler installed by MysterX, since
commenting it out gives the same problem.

(You don't have this control on your machine, Bullard hacked it
up in VB.)

>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")
(define doc (make-object mx-document%))
(send doc show #f)
(define ie (send doc insert-object "IEautomationSlim.IEapi"))
(exit)

State-Changed-Why:
Bug is not reproducible with any other control I've tried, so I'm
chalking it up to the control itself.  Commenting out the various
pieces of MysterX exit code didn't get rid of the crash.
