>Description:
A scheme function can be written and saved on the hard drive.  The function will work correctly if executed from the hard drive.

However, when transferring the file from the hard drive to the floppy drive, a build-path error occurs and the function cannot be execute properly.  Issue may regard that the function's path has changed from the local disk to the floppy disk.  

If the function is written on the floppy initially, the function will execute correctly.  But if the path is changed, the function will stop working correctly.  

Here is the exact output the build-path error states:
build-path: expects type <string or 'up or 'same> as 1st argument, given: false; other arguments were: "A:\\"
> 


>How-To-Repeat:
1. write code on the hard disk.  Make sure the function executes correctly in current path.

2. Change the path of the file... Known problem is from hard disk to floppy disk.

3. Execute function from new path.

4. Error occurs.

 Thanks for your report. I am having a little trouble reproducing the
 problem, however. Perhaps you can answer a few questions for me to help
 me out.
 
 When you say "transfer" the file, do you mean that you use "Save As..."
 from inside DrScheme, or some other method? Please be very specific
 about the steps involved in "transfering" the file.
 
 Thanks!

 a problem with some course material supplied by his professor, not with
