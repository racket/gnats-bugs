>Release:        52
>Environment:
Solaris
>Description:
The following code:
(define C (class null () (sequence (super-init))))
(define c (make-object C))
(list c c)
(define D (class null () (sequence (super-init))))
(define d (make-object D))
(list c d)
(eq? (object-class c) (object-class d))
(define l (cons 4 null))
(list l l)

Produces the output:
(list (make-object #0=(class ...)) (make-object #0#))
(list (make-object #0=(class ...)) (make-object #0#))
#f
(shared ((-1- (list 4))) (list -1- -1-))

It *should* have produced the output:
(list #0=(make-object (class ...)) #0)
(list (make-object (class ...)) (make-object (class ...)))
...
>How-To-Repeat:
I evaluated the above mentioned code.
