>Description:
The system does not recognize numbers that are correct according to r5rs document.

"#o1#/1" produces: read-number: misplaced hash: 1#/1
"1#/1" produces: reference to undefined identifier: 1#/1

These can be derived from the grammar as follows:
<token> => 
<number> => 
<num8> => 
<prefix8> <complex8> => 
<radix8> <exactness> <complex8> =>
#o <complex8> =>
#o <real8> =>
#o <sign> <ureal8> =>
#o <uinteger8> / <uniteger8> =>
#o <digit8>+ #* / <digit8>+ #* =>
#o1#/1

<token> => 
<number> => 
<num10> => 
<prefix10> <complex10> => 
<radix10> <exactness> <complex10> =>
<complex10> =>
<real10> =>
<sign> <ureal10> =>
<uinteger10> / <uniteger10> =>
<digit10>+ #* / <digit10>+ #* =>
1#/1






>How-To-Repeat:
Select menu "Language-Choose Language"
Select option "Standard (R5RS)"
Press "OK"
Press "Execute"
Enter the following into the command line:
#o1#/1 
1#/1

 Thanks for the report. This bug has been fixed for the next release.
 
 While looking more closely at # handling, I found another problem, this
 one with hex digits that look like exponent markers. Given the usual
 extension of "decimal" notation to hex digits, my new favorite constant
 is #e#x+e#s+e@-e#l-e.
