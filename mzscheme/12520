>Description:
When linking a shared library against /usr/lib/libracket3m.a,
it fails with a well known
/usr/lib/libracket3m.a: could not read symbols: Bad value

Info about the issue: http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/amd64/howtos/index.xml?part=1&chap=3#doc_chap7

Actually the racket garbage collector (gc) uses fPIC flag on x86_64 yet,
btw not enough, since other objects needs to be built with -fPIC too.

Building the whole racket with export CFLAGS="-fPIC" solves.
>How-To-Repeat:
build fluxus from git on x86_64
http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/
(You'll probably need to apply this patch http://lists.pawfal.org/pipermail/fluxus-pawfal.org/attachments/20111006/97b8194a/attachment.txt
and the other described here https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fl/fluxus-git/PKGBUILD)
or link any shared lib against /usr/lib/libracket3m.a
>Fix:
