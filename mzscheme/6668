>Description:
I find it annoying to have the scheme autosave
and preferences files sitting in the root of 
my home directory.  On windows (at least 
windows >= Windows 2000), it would be better 
to use a custom subfolder in the APPDATA 
directory.  (APPDATA is an environment 
variable on my XP system; I believe it is set
automatically.)  Specifically, I think
(find-system-path 'pref-dir) should return
%APPDATA%\plt\MzScheme (or whatever) if 
APPDATA exists.
