Bug or feature? 

Killing a thread that contains a DYNAMIC-WIND clause kills the 'after' thunk, too. Shouldn't the 'after' thunk be called?
>How-To-Repeat:
> (define thr 
       (thread 
         (lambda () 
            (dynamic-wind 
              (lambda () (values)) 
              (lambda () 
                 (display "Step 1...") 
                 (newline) 
                 (sleep 30) 
                 (display "Step 2")) 
               (lambda () (display-all "...Cleanup."))))))

 Feature. Killing a thread terminates the thread immediately, so it
 can't do anything else.
 
 Does `break-thread' do what you want?
