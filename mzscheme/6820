>Description:
I think that it should never fail like this, instead
the preferences file should just be dumped if this
happens.

In this particular case, it was nice to get the error
since I was saving something bogus in there, but the
error should have happened when the file was
*written* not read!
>How-To-Repeat:
Put something bad into the preferences file:

>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 10:03:04 -0400
Reason>>> looks like this is an mzlib bug


State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sun, 27 Nov 2011 13:38:12 -0500
Reason>>> fixed (relatively recently)
