>Description:
On my Gentoo system, /usr/local/man is a symlink to /usr/local/share/man,
I tried to install mzscheme from source, under prefix=/usr/local.
Make install tried to execute the command
  cp -p -r ./../man /usr/local/.
which resulted in the following error:
  cp: cannot overwrite non-directory `/usr/local/./man' with directory `./../man'
thus make install halted with an error.

My quick fix was to change the command
          cp -p -r $(srcdir)/../man $(prefix)/.
to
          cp -vp -r $(srcdir)/../man/* $(prefix)/man/
in the plt/src/Makefile (under target copytree),
then re-run make install (as root).  Then, mzscheme installed fine,
including the manual page.  I do not know how to fix this error properly, 
as I'm not very good with make and autoconf.

I am using GNU coreutils 5.2.0 on an i686-linux box.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a gentoo system, where /usr/local/man is a symlink to share/man,
download mzscheme, decompress, do
  cd plt/src
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared
  make
then, as root, do (in the same directory)
  make install

should play with that stuff...)
