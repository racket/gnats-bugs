>Description:
When I supply a "pretty-print-size-hook" and a 
pretty-print-print-hook, which "hook" on to the printing 
of symbols, I get strange behaviour if the object to be 
pretty-printed includes a list whose car is the symbols 
pre or post. With these two handlers, I have also supplied 
pre- and post- pretty-print hooks.

Specifically, when the symbol pre is seen in the list 
(pre "text"), I get an extra call to my pre-print hook,
with the object 3. When the symbol post is seen in the 
list (post "text"), I get an extra call to my 
post-print hook, with the object 4.

It seems that 'pre and 'post are used internally in 
the pretty printer, and that in at least this case, there 
a "capture" problem, when these symbols appear in the 
input. I have created a modified version of pretty.ss, 
where the uses of 'pre and 'post within the pretty printer 
instead use unique objects as "pre-marks" and "post-marks". 
This seems to solve my problem.

Also, with just the pre- and post- hooks (i.e.
without the size hook and print hook) the problem
does not occur.




>How-To-Repeat:
The following code will illustrate the problem.

(require (lib "pretty.ss"))

(define (symbol->write-format s)
  (let ((p (open-output-string)))
    (write s p)
    (get-output-string p)))

(define (test obj)
  (parameterize ([pretty-print-size-hook
                  (lambda (x display? port)
                    (and (symbol? x)
                         (string-length (symbol->write-format x))))]
                 [pretty-print-print-hook 
                  (lambda (x display? port)
                    (display (symbol->write-format x)))]
                 [pretty-print-pre-print-hook
                  (lambda (obj p)
                    (display (format "~nin pre-hook: given ~s~n" obj))
                    (void))]
                 [pretty-print-post-print-hook
                  (lambda (obj p)
                    (display (format "~nin post-hook: given ~s" obj))
                    (void))])
    (pretty-print obj)
    (void)))

Calling (test '(a (pre "text") b)) will show in the 
output the following lines:
> in pre-hook: given pre
> in pre-hook: given 3
> in post-hook: given pre 

When called with a list which includes (post "text"),
one will see a similar, "unbalanced" call to the 
post-hook, but with 4 as the object.

 You're right. If you look at collects/mzlib/pretty.ss, you'll find uses
 or 'pre and 'post, and it looks to me that they get mingled with the
 value to print. (Who wrote this junk?! Er, according to the CVS logs, I
 did...)
 
 In CVS, I've changed the uses or 'pre and 'post to pre-sym and
 post-sym:
 
    (define pre-sym (gensym 'pre))
    (define post-sym (gensym 'post))
