>Environment:
MS Windows 98
>Description:
When a unit/sig has two define-structs that both define the same thing,
it does not catch the error; instead the unit form catches the error.
This is in mzscheme; I didn't check zodiac.
>How-To-Repeat:
 (unit/sig ()        
    (import)

    (define-struct a ())
    (define-struct a ()))
