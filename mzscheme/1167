>Description:
The documentation for read-line says the symbols 'any-break and
'any-one-break are permitted.  Using these as options gives the error

read-line: expects type <newline specification symbol> as 2nd argument, given: any-break; other arguments were: #<user-input-port>

and similarly for any-one-break.

(This may actually be an implementation, not documentation, bug; indeed,
I hope it is since these seem like very useful flags.)

 I found the problem in src/mzscheme/src/port.c.  The flags are called
 any and any-one, not any-break and any-one-break.

 I don't understand where you saw `any-break' and `any-one-break' in the
 docs.
 
 In the MzScheme docs, I see
 
  'any -- break lines on any of a return character, [...]
 
  'any-one -- break lines on either a return or linefeed character, [...]
 
 Perhaps the dashes looked like hypens?

 Right you are.  The combination of fonts and spacing AND the fact that
 'any-break and 'any-one-break are perfectly reasonable names for these
 delimiters is what threw me off.  (I had been looking specifically for
 the 'any-break flag, and on that line there are no other dashes, so
 it's especially impossible to distinguish the separator dash from a
 hyphen.)  Even now, the 'any-break line throws me off.
