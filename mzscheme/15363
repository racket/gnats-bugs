>Description:
When I run the following Racket file from the command line, I get a "SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr (nil)" error. I did not encounter this error with Racket v6.5.

$ cat test.rkt 
#lang racket

(define (f)
  (define x (read-line))
  (write-byte 65)
  (string-append x x)
  (write-byte 65))
(f)
$ racket --version
Welcome to Racket v6.6.
$ echo "foobar" | racket test.rkt
SIGSEGV MAPERR si_code 1 fault on addr (nil)
Aborted (core dumped)
$

This error occurs on my Ubuntu 14.04 and Gentoo computer. It also occurs on my Windows 10 laptop when I use the Racket.exe executable (on Windows, I don't actually see the error message, instead Windows just shows a "Racket application has stopped working" window)
>How-To-Repeat:
Step 1. Create this Racket file:

#lang racket

(define (f)
  (define x (read-line))
  (write-byte 65)
  (string-append x x)
  (write-byte 65))
(f)

2. Run the file with Racket v6.6 command line interpreter.

3. The interpreter will crash.

 I forgot to mention that the problem is a recently introduced bug in
 single-argument `write-byte` and `write-char`. If you need a
 workaround, supply `(current-output-port)` as an explicit second
 argument to `write-byte`.
