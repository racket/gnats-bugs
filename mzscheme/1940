>Description:
Hi PLT-Team,

setup-plt do not work on linux-alpha

after the first run of setup-plt (during make install) it is nesessary to
clean all .zo files (setup-plt -c -n) to get drscheme to work again.

I will be glad to give you any other userful detail, write me to

   maggesi@math.unifi.it

Marco.

Don't know if you still care, but we finally figured this one out.  A
part of the GC implementation needs to be replaced; I can send you the
relevant file (alpha_mach_dep.s) if you need it.
