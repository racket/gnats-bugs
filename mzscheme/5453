Hello,


I can't get plt103 installed on Linux RedHat 7.3.  Wether I'm using gcc 2.96 (bad on) or gcc 2.95.3 I keep on getting a segmentation fault for whatever linux/unix (both RPM & non-compiled ones) package:
./install: line 151:20938 Segmentation fault bin/setup-plt.  I can run configure, make and make install, but not the ./install (even when I choose not to create .zo files).  Could you help me solve the problem?  I don't want to use the newer version of Drscheme, because at the university we use the older one.


With kind regards,

Maurits

 There's a bug in v103 so that it gets confused when the stack size
 isn't limited by the OS.
 
 One way around the bug is to set a stack limit. In csh, that's
 
  % limit stack 8192
  % ./install
 
 Better, you can upgrade to version 200alpha19.
