>Description:
"""
13.2  Will Executors

A will executor manages a collection of values and associated will procedures. The will procedure for each value is ready to be executed when the value has been proven (by the automatic memory manager) to be unreachable, except through will executors, weak boxes, weak hash table keys, and custodians. A will is useful for triggering clean-up actions on data associated with an unreachable value, such as closing a port embedded in an object when the object is no longer used.

Calling the will-execute or will-try-execute procedure executes a will that is ready in the specified will executor. Wills are not executed automatically, because certain programs need control to avoid race conditions. However, a program can create thread whose sole job is to execute wills for a particular executor.
"""

The last sentence should say "...can create a thread..."
