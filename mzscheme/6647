>Description:
Stressing the web-server using a toll called siege will
cause the process to seg-fault after 5-10 minutes.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. download, build and install siege from:
http://www.joedog.org/siege/index.php
2. start the web-server
../../bin/web-server-text3m -p 9000 -f configuration-table
3. start siege
siege -c 50 -u http://localhost:9000/servlets/examples/count.ss
4. wait...

Results:
After about 5-10 minutes the mzscheme process running the server
will seg-fault.
