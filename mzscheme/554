 Do you believe it should only kill the current "process" instead (ie,
 akin to typing `exit' in the REPL)?

 Yes. 
 
 One way to fix this is to check the current exit handler. If it's the
 default handler, then a real execute can be performed.  (A "real
 execute" preserves the process ID in Unix.)
 
 Relying the the default exit handler is weird, but it's simple and I
 doubt anyone will ever need anything more.

 Ah, now I understand what you mean. I don't see why you suggest looking at
 the exit-handler.
 
 I can just substitute a new definition of execute for the one in the
 drscheme's namespace. Of course, I cannot do a real exec, so the pid's
 won't be the same but that's never going to be supported anyway.

 PS: this is also a problem for MzOS.

 No, you can't. (I used `#%execute' in an attempt to head off this
 path, but I should have been more explicit.)  The built-in execute
 must work correctly.
 
 The idea is that execute is like system followed by exit. Hence the
 reliance on the exit handler. When the defailt exit handler is
 installed, the OS's execute can be used (resulting in useful extra
 behavior under Unix - that's the slightly weird part). Otherwise,
 execute will really be implemented with system and exit.

 I am willing to have drscheme not 
 comletely support #%execute, in that manner.
 
 Why do you think that is a bad allowance?

 We're clearly not communicating here. Let's table the discussion until
 the next DrScheme meeting.
