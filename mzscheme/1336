>Description:
In the following excerpt it says that the 
unit doesn't export anything but it
exports x. Please fix. 

Examples

The unit defined below imports and exports no variables. Each time it is invoked, it prints and returns the current time in seconds:.

  (define f1@
     (unit
       (import) (export x)
       (define x (current-seconds))
       (display x) (newline) x))

The expression below is syntactically invalid because current-date is not a built-in procedure:
