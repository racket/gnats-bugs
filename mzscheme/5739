>Description:
I'm trying to use an extension with mixed-case procedure
names.  I've set the language to be case sensitive.  My 
extension's init procedure has the following:   

scheme_add_global("new-SSHmap", scheme_make_prim_w_arity(_wrap_new_SSHmap,"new-SSHmap",1,1),env);

..but trying to call new-SSHmap requires that I use all lowercase, like so:

-------------
> (new-sshmap 0)
#swig
> (new-SSHmap 0)
. reference to undefined identifier: new-SSHmap
> 
-----

Is there any way to make this work correctly?  My extension
 has functions that are spelled the same, but with different
 cases.

 scheme_add_global() interns the name case-insensitively. Embedding
 applications can change to case sensitivity by setting the
 scheme_case_sensitive global to 1, but extensions can't (or shouldn't).
 
 To reliably get case-sensitive names, use scheme_add_global_symbol()
 with a first argument constructed by scheme_intern_exact_symbol():
 
  scheme_add_global_symbol(scheme_intern_exact_symbol("new-SSHmap", 10), 
                           scheme_make_prim_w_arity(_wrap_new_SSHmap,
                                                    "new-SSHmap",1,1),
                           env);
 
 
 Did SWIG generate the call to scheme_add_global()?

 Hey man!  How are things?  I ran into Cindi Thompson and a couple of her 
 students at AAAI a couple weeks ago.  It sounds like you're doing well.
 
 I've been meaning to ask you some higher-level questions about 
 MrEd/MzScheme, and give you a chance to evangelize me. ;-)  ...but I'll 
 save that stuff for another message.

 Hmm.  I call (load-extension) after I set the case sensitivity of the 
 language (manually in drscheme).  I guess that doesn't control the case 
 sensitivity of scheme_add_global_symbol()?
 
 It seems like case is being preserved in the symbol table, since if I 
 call new-sshmap with the wrong number of arguments, the error message 
 prints the name as "new-SSHmap"... but I guess I don't know if that 
 message is coming from within the extension, or from the interpreter.

 Yes.  But there's no documentation for mzscheme wrapper generation on 
 the SWIG website...
