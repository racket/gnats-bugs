>Description:
The description of quotient in the 
Help Desk only says "Purpose: to 
compute the quotient of two integers"; 
this is not useful.  The contract gives
one a _hint_ as to what it does, but 
its not realistic to expect students
to derive that much from the contract.

(Of course a student can just
play at the Interactions Window, but the
docs really should serve as specifications
for the arithmetic routines.)

I'm also not thrilled by the documentation
for the modulo procedure.

(Carl Eastlund suggested to me that all of 
this documentation could probably use a 
once-over by a third party who specializes
in English more than Mathematics or 
Programming.)
>How-To-Repeat:
1. In Beginning Student, type quotient

2. Hit F1 and attempt to extract useful info 
from the view-point of a student.
