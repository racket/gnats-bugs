>Description:
Macros constructing sequences of def-or-expr for implicit begin (as found in let, lambda, parameterize, etc.) won't always know if the sequence is empty or non-empty, and whether it is terminated by an expression or definition.  It would be far more convenient if primitive forms worked with any sequence of def-or-expr.

#lang racket
;; OK:
(let () 1 (define x 2) 3)
(parameterize () 1 (define x 2) 3)
;; Bad:
(let())
(parameterize())
(let () 1 2 (define x 3))
(parameterize () 1 2 (define x 3))

 This is a design discussion, not a bug report, so it belongs on the dev
