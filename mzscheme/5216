>Description:
Hello,

The system I am working on (as a research project)
 makes important use of define-macros "a la" common lisp.

I know hygienic macro-systems are more elegant but
still, I find the CL macros very useful (for stateful
macros).

I am a littled bit "sad" they disappeared from my
favorite scheme environment. I am "playing" with the awful
"eval" to find a workaround but ... well ... I am sad ;-)

Note : I *need* to get informations from the global
       environment

Anyway, welcome to the new DrScheme !
Fred.

 `define-macro' is still available: (require (lib "defmacro.ss"))
 
 It's not quite the same, because the top-level environment is split
 into run-time and expand-time parts. But usually it's easy to
 module-ize the macro helper functions and import them with
 `require-for-syntax'.

 Sorry for the delay in responding to this message. You might want to 
 check out the defmacro.ss library. It has support for define-macro 
 that covers most uses.
 
 If you are having particular problems even when using that library, 
 if you can send a small example that demonstrates what you are trying 
 to do, we might be able to help you.
