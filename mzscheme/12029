>Description:
Try these two:

  (get-module-code '#%kernel)
  (get-module-code 'arrrrgh)

And note the different error messages since the second goes through
the contract.  Worse, the specified type is different in the two
messages.

So it looks like:

1. The first check in the *body* of `get-module-code' should be
   removed since there's a contract.

2. The contract should probably be revised to have only
   `path-string?'.

3. There's a new exception in the file too, it should probably be
   based on `exn:fail' instead of directly on `exn'.  Probably rename
   it to reflect this too.

I'll be happy to do these if someone (not clear if it's Matthew's or
Robby's) verifies these things.

 I don't think that's my code, but those sound like good changes to me
 (2. seems like the only non-obvious one.)
