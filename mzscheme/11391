>Description:
A very simple web servelet, that includes a module that uses rackunit, generates the above error when I try to run it.  Commenting out the "define-test-suite" line makes the thing compile successfully.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create "stuff.rkt" with this content:

    #! /bin/sh
    #| Hey Emacs, this is -*-scheme-*- code!
    #$Id$
    exec racket -l errortrace --require "$0" --main -- ${1+"$@"}
    |#

    #lang racket
    (require rackunit rackunit/text-ui)

    (require racket/date
             (prefix-in srfi-19- srfi/19))

    (define-test-suite stuff-tests (check-equal? 2 2))

    (provide stuff)
    (define (stuff)
      "Yep, I'm some stuff, all right"
      )

Now create "silly.rkt" with this content:

    #! /bin/sh
    #| Hey Emacs, this is -*-scheme-*- code!
    #$Id$
    exec racket -l errortrace --require "$0" --main -- ${1+"$@"}
    |#

    #lang web-server/insta

    (require "stuff.rkt")

    (define (start request)
      `(html
        (head (title "Stuff"))
        (body
         (p ,(format "Here's some stuff: ~a" (stuff))))))

Make silly.rkt executable, and run it.

You _should_ see a message about "Your servelet is running, look in your browser", etc.  Instead you see

    ./silly.rkt
    compile: access from an uncertified context to unexported variable from module: "/usr/local/src/racket/collects/racket/contract/private/base.rkt" in: apply-contract

Now comment out the "define-test-suite" line in stuff.rkt, and try again; this time it works.

 I deleted the "bash trampoline" (i.e., every line before #lang
 web-server/insta), and then ran "racket silly.rkt"; that time it
 worked fine.
