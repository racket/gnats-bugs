Thanks!
>How-To-Repeat:
When I try to un configure on my MacBook Pro, I get the following:
configure: error: "libffi has not been ported to i686-apple-darwin8.5.1."
configure: error: /bin/sh './configure' failed for foreign/gcc/libffi

 Yes - try the current development snapshot, version 307.1:
 
    http://svn.plt-scheme.org/
   or
    http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/
 
 I have built and tested MzScheme on an Intel Mac, but I only had
 console access, so I wasn't able to try MrEd or DrScheme. Please let me
 know whether it works.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
