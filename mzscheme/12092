I've written Racket versions of atan2 twice now, two years apart. I was surprised (and a little disappointed) both times when it wasn't in the standard library.

The steps to reproduce contain implementations of "atan2" and "flatan2".

 Racket's `atan' can take two arguments, in which case it behaves like
 `atan2'.
 
 This is not the case with `flatan', though.

 Vincent -- I don't know why Sam chose to assign this to you, but one
 thing I wanted to say about it as someone who recently fell victim to
 the lack of `atan2': if the two how about adding a note in the `atan'
 docs that explicitly says that it's known as `atan2', and also
 indexing that term so it will be found in searches?

 I assigned it to Vincent because (a) it would be useful for his
 optimizer and (b) he knows the relevant code well enough to fix it.
