Responsible changed from "nobody" to "mflatt" by eli at Fri, 23 Apr 2004 10:00:52 -0400
Reason>>> mzscheme (either a doc bug or a missing export)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 02 Jun 2004 13:35:02 -0400
Reason>>> I didn't check in older versions, but the function
doesn't exist n v299, and I changed the docs accordingly.

Thanks,
Matthew
