>Description:
In base.sls of the PLT test program for R6RS Scheme,
the following test is incorrect:

    (test (expt 0 5+.0000312i)         0)

Implementations of the R6RS are required to return
an inexact result for that test, following the general
rule stated in R6RS section 11.7.1:

    The general rule is that the generic operations...
    return an inexact result when any argument is
    inexact.

The example does not fall within the general exception
to that rule (stated in the paragraph following the
general rule) because (expt 0 0) is 1 but (expt 0 1)
is 0.  Since the value of the second argument affects
the result, passing an inexact value for the second
argument mandates an inexact result.

I realize that the test	is based upon an example in
R6RS section 11.7.4.3, but that	example	is incorrect
for the	reasons	given above.  I have posted the	above
to r6rs-discuss@lists.r6rs.org,	which seems to be the
best place to submit errata of this kind.

>How-To-Repeat:
Implementations of the R6RS that return a correct result for
(expt 0 5+.0000312i) will fail this test.
