>Description:
The temporary .c file that mzc creates when compiling
to .so will silently destroy any currently existing
file that's in its way. See "Steps to Reproduce" for
my reasoning on why this should be considered a bug.

(I suppose that's what's happening. mzc might just
be destroying C source code out of spite, in which
case this is not a bug, but a feature.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a C program.
Decide it would be fun to write the same program
   in Scheme. Give the two programs the same name,
   i.e., "sphere.c" and "sphere.ss". 
Notice that the Scheme program is rather slow, and
   wonder if compiling it would speed things up.
   "mzc sphere.ss". Note that sphere.c also lives
   in this directory.
Later, decide to edit the C program a bit, and wonder
   why it vanished...

 I agree that it's a serious design flaw. I'll fix it somehow.
 
 Thanks for the problem report.

State-Changed-Why:
Changed mzc to use filenames in /tmp, unless the
--save-temps flags is specified. (Changed --dirty to
--save-temps, to match gcc flag name.)
