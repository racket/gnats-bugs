 True.
 
 Does anyone consider this a bug, or is it just a lack of specification?
 
 It bothers me that the eq?-ness is not specified in the MzScheme
 manual, but it doesn't seem important to me whether instances of the
 primitives are eq? in different namespaces.
 
 I can change MzScheme if it's important, but I'd prefer to leave the
 implementation alone.
