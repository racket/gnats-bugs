>Description:
The module under "Steps to Reproduce" imports scheme (as its language) and lang/htdp-beginner (via require).

If the expression (lambda (x) x) is entered in the body of the module, it results in a static error appropriate to the lang/htdp-beginner binding.

If the same expression is entered at the REPL after running this module in the DrScheme Module language, it produces a procedure appropriate to the scheme binding.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang scheme
(require lang/htdp-beginner)

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN.

A couple of weeks ago, I fixed a problem with syntax objects
where shadowing of initial imports didn't marshal to
and from bytecode correctly. That repair broke
`module->namespace', whose source had a note along the
lines of "shouldn't I reverse this list?"; the answer
became "yes" after the other bug was fixed.
