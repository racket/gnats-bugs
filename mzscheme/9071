>Description:
  (magnitude +inf.0+inf.0i)
returns
  +nan.0
instead of
  +inf.0

(unless there's some weird IEEE reason why +nan.0 is actually considered the correct answer.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sat, 17 Nov 2007 22:59:21 -0500
Reason>>> Just the other day, I was lamenting to friends that MzScheme's
numeric system was a dozen years old, and yet I was sure to
get a bug report within the next year.

Fixed in SVN (for both v371.x and v3.99)
