>Description:
Trying to verify what `final' is requires chacing a few links
(`define/public-final' -> `public-final' -> "Method Definitions"),
and eventually there is no clear description of it.  The only thing
that I found is this very indirect text:

  The only difference between public-final and pubment without a
  corresponding inner is that public-final prevents the declaration
  of augmenting methods that would be ignored.
