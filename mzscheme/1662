>Description:
The pretty-printer doesn't seem to recognize the first token in
a list as the first token in the list when it's displayed by the
print-hook.  The result is ... well, see the code below. This code
pretty-prints the same value twice, with different widths.  The
first one is screwy, the second one is fine.

When the
first element in the pretty-printed list is a placeholder which is
recognized by the size-hook and printed by the print-hook, the
pretty-printer doesn't print a space after it and lines up all
subsequent lines with the thing right after it. This looks like
a bug to me.  At the very least, this behavior is deeply counter-
intuitive. 

Also, I don't see an easy hack to work around this; to compensate
for this behavior, I'd have to know whether the value I'm inser-
ting is the first element in the list or not. Er, and whether this
list will wrap. No, this is pretty definitely a bug.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
(require-library "pretty.ss")

(pretty-print-size-hook
 (lambda (value display? port)
   (if (eq? value 'placeholder)
       1
       #f)))

(pretty-print-print-hook
 (lambda (value display? port)
   (printf "~s" 'a)))

(define to-be-printed '(placeholder b c d e f g h i j k))

(pretty-print-columns 20)
(pretty-print to-be-printed)

(pretty-print-columns 30)
(pretty-print to-be-printed)

    For this bug to happen, the hook-recognzed item must have
    been a symbol, the symbol must have been more than 5
    characters wide, and the size-hook must return a result
    less than 6. More generally, pretty-print didn't ask the
    size-hook before attempting to handle symbols like
    'lambda and 'quote.
