>Description:
Section 4.8.3 of the Racket Guide says for the "when" form.
-----------------------------------------
4.8.3 Effects If...: when and unless
Guarded Evaluation: when and unless in The Racket Reference also documents when and unless.
The when form combines an if-style conditional with sequencing for the “then” clause and no “else” clause:(when test-expr then-expr ...)

If test-expr produces a true value, then all of the then-exprs are evaluated. Otherwise, no then-exprs are evaluated. The result is #<void> in any case.
----------------------------

The last sentence "The result is #<void> in any case." gives the impression that "when" always returns #<void> even test-expr evaluates to #t .
