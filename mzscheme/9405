>Description:
The parameters of scheme_dynamic_wind (in the scribble docs for "Inside") are not congruous with the description (and are presumably not actually void*). (collects/scribblings/inside/exns.scrbl)

Scheme_Object* scheme_dynamic_wind(void* data)

Evaluates calls the function action to get a value for the scheme_dynamic_wind call. The functions pre and post are invoked when jumping into and out of action, respectively.

The function jmp_handler is called when an error is signaled (or an escaping continuation is invoked) during the call to action; if jmp_handler returns NULL, then the error is passed on to the next error handler, otherwise the return value is used as the return value for the scheme_dynamic_wind call.

The pointer data can be anything; it is passed along in calls to action, pre, post, and jmp_handler.
