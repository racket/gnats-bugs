>Description:
The Racket Guide Section 15.1 eval says:

The eval function takes a “quoted” expression or definition and evaluates it:
This gives the impression for someone new to Racket that the eval function "only" takes a quoted expression or definition as an argument. It wasn't until I saw the more complete description in the Reference manual that I saw that I could use "eval" to solve my problem. (see below)

The Racket Reference section 13.2 says more completely:  
"The evaluation handler is called by eval,. . . to evaluate a top-level form. . . . The top-level-form provided to the [evaluation] handler can be a syntax object, a compiled form, a compiled form wrapped as a syntax object, or an arbitrary datum."
