>Description:
Exception in mred.exe
Access Violation (0x0000005)
Address 0x004e6f7a

When I saved my interactions and returned back
to DrScheme, "recycle" icon blinked and
the application crashed throwing the exception
described above on the screen.

This is the second time this happens, and
both times the crash ocurred when the "recycle"
icon blinked.(At that time I pasted something from 
     the clipboard.) 
>How-To-Repeat:
Its random, I guess. Please note that
both of the times the crash has ocurred 
I had been working for about 4-5 hours without 
quitting the application. It seems that there 
is some kind of memeory leak or something.
