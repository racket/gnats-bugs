>Description:
Doc for expt says "to compute the exponent of two numbers".
This is inaccurate: (expt 2 3) computes the value 8, but 3 is the
exponent. So expt computes the power, not the exponent. Also, the
doc doesn't give the slightest indication that the first arg is
the base and the second the exponent, not the other way around.
