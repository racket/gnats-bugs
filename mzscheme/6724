>Description:
Calling open() in a C extension crashes Windows MzScheme.
I have the latest PLT and Cygwin installed on XP.
>How-To-Repeat:
(load-extension "arf.dll")
(arf)

Here is the source and a makefile.
/home/plt is a symbolic link in cygwin to
/cygdrive/c/Program Files/PLT.

#include "escheme.h"

static Scheme_Object *
sch_arf(int argc, Scheme_Object **argv)
{
  int fd = open("in.txt", 0);
  return scheme_make_string("hi");
}

Scheme_Object *scheme_reload(Scheme_Env *env)
{
  scheme_add_global("arf",
    scheme_make_prim_w_arity(sch_arf, "arf", 0, 0), env);
  return scheme_make_string("Hello Arf!");
}

Scheme_Object *scheme_initialize(Scheme_Env *env)
{
  return scheme_reload(env);
}

Scheme_Object *scheme_module_name()
{
  /* This extension doesn't define a module: */
  return scheme_false;
}

===========

PLT=/home/plt

 Hi Ron,
 
 Is this a different problem than before?
 
 My impression that that mzc currently doesn't work when linking
 cygwin-built extensions that use the cygwin DLL, and you had to call
 the compiler and linker directly.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Hi,
 
 Sorry, no, it's the same problem.

 Alas, that worked for a while, but not after the most recent upgrades
 of DrScheme and Cygwin.  I keep hoping it's me, because I might be
 able to solve that!
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ron

 The last time I looked into this, I learned that a DLL using Cygwin is
 supposed to declare and initialize a specially named variable (or
 something like that) before calling the Cygwin API.
 
 Does that ring a bell, and might it be relevant?

Reason: mzscheme bug

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:36:40 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
