MzScheme builded on Suse 8.2 (glibc 2.3.2) core dumped after build. Same problem was on RedHat > 8.0, but it was fixed by back porting gc from plt 203. I try to back port gc from current exp cvs, but it still core dump. On Redhat 9.0 with glibc 2.3.x all working fine

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Thu, 01 Apr 2004 18:02:05 -0500
Reason: v103 is ancient, it is provided only in case it is useful 
when using old code.  It is otherwise impractical to fix 
such bugs in those versions.
