>Description:
Looks like byte code became more sensitive to changes now.  (Due to
changes in inlining and dealing with keyworded functions?)  To see this,
start from a fully compiled tree, open "collects/help/search.rkt" and
replace the definition of `send-main-page' with the one in the following
comment.  After that, and with no further compilation, DrRacket works
fine.  But if the function is changed to take different keywords (for
example, drop the `#:notify') *or* if there's a new toplevel definition
(for example, add a (define bogus 0)), drracket won't start, with an error
that points to the single file that uses this:

  link: module mismatch, probably from old bytecode whose dependencies
  have changed: variable not provided (directly or indirectly and at the
  expected position) from module:
  "/home/scheme/plt/collects/help/search.rkt" accessed from module:
  "/home/scheme/plt/collects/drracket/private/help-desk.rkt" at source
  phase level: 0 in: send-main-page11.3

So the first problem is that this error message is more common so it's
really bad to leave it as is since it's full of techincal details that
are not useful to an average user.  Even worse, in both cases I get the
same error message, so in the case of the extra definition it's even
less useful than that.  How about changing it to something like:

  link: the bytcode for
    "/home/scheme/plt/collects/drracket/private/help-desk.rkt"
  is outdated due to a dependency on
    "/home/scheme/plt/collects/help/search.rkt"

possibly followed by extra text that is not useful in most cases (the
identifier name, the phase, and the fact that this is all qualified by a
"probably").

It would of course be better if there's a way to avoid the failure (by
loading the first file from source maybe, if possible? with a warning
about it?).
