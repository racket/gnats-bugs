>Description:
The errors generated by module-begin and datum are not
very user-friendly.  For example, using the lambda
calculus example in the documentation, if I write

(module m lambda-calculus 3 4)

DrScheme prints

#%module-begin: bad syntax in: (#%module-begin 3 4)

and if I enter

(module m lambda-calculus  4)

it prints

#%datum: bad syntax in: (#%datum . 4)

>How-To-Repeat:
Enter the lambda-calculus module.
Try the above expressions.

 Those errors are from the `lambda-calculus' module itself. I'll grant
 that they're not friendly, but making them better would inflate the
 example.
