MS Windows NT
>Description:
read-char and read-string return the incorrect (first) character
when you peek before changing file position.
>How-To-Repeat:
I believe this will illustrate the problem.
Create a file with the following line:
Wonder what this will do?

set file-position to 5.  read-string of 5 returns "r wha".
peek-char.  Returns "t".
set file-position to 0.  read-string of 5 returns "tWond".
It should return "Wond".
It does return "Wond" if you don't do the peek-char.

(The rule, "a read following a peek must return what peek returned" 
is not correct after a file-position change.)

 Yep. I'll fix it.
 
 I see there's also a problem with reporting the file position after a
 peek:
 
   > (define p (open-input-file "README"))
   > (file-position p)
   0
   > (peek-char p)
   #\newline
   > (file-position p)
   1
 
 Seems like `file-position' should return 0 in this case.
 
 Thanks for the report,
 Matthew
