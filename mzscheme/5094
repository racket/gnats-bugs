>Description:
According to the documentation of regexp-match, if you
put a slash in front of any character in a range, that
should match that character. But, this doesn't seem
to work properly for the close square bracket.

Also, that single slash really should be a double
slash in the docs. 

I know that what it means is to have an actual
slash in the string, which means it must be doubled,
but it would be nice if the documentation used 
scheme's input string syntax.

 The grammar's "Literal" is not reachable from "Range" (but "RLiteral"
 is). Backslash has no special meaning in a range.

 What is an RLiteral?
 
 Is it possible to make a regexp range that mathces both hyphens and 
 close right brackets?

 It's a non-terminal, like "Range" and "Literal", in the manual's
 grammar for regexp strings.

 Yes:
 
  > (regexp-match "[]-]" "-")
  ("-")
  > (regexp-match "[]-]" "]")
  ("]")
 
 So, the grammar in the manual is incomplete. "Range" should have one
 more case:
 
      ]LRange-

 I re-downloaded the mzscheme manual and I still don't see `RLiteral'.
 It's possible I'm just missing it over and over again (I do that with
 typos....) but perhaps you should take a look and see if you see it.

 You're right - it's not in the pre-release manuals that I built at
 school. It is in the docs I built on my home machine (which is what I
 was reading before), and it's in the 200alpha1 docs.
 
 The problem is that the image for the table on my school machine was
 built a long time ago, when "Rliteral" was missing. tex2page seems
 reluctant to re-build images (even if the content changes).
 
 Dorai: is there an easy way to make tex2page update images, or should I
 start with a fresh build directory every time?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 t2p won't build an image if it's already there (it has
 no realistic way to track that the content of the image
 has changed).  You just need to delete the image and
 t2p will rebuild it afresh.  In general, if a whole
 bunch of images have changed, or their order in the doc
 has changed, it's a good idea to delete all images.  If
 you don't mind rebuilding images every time you run t2p
 (the machines I develop t2p on are quite elderly),
 perhaps I should provide a \dontrecycleimages command? 
 
 I would rm *.gif before re-t2p'ing a constantly
 debugged doc on a fast machine.  On slower machines or
 on machines that don't have the netpbm lib, if
 possible, I would recycle existing images from a
 faster machine or from a previous run. 
 
 Vide sections 6.5, 6.6 of the t2p manual.
