>Description:
The program below should print out 'g (as it does) and then give an error message in terms of g, but the error message is in terms of f.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket/base
(struct s (a) #:property prop:procedure 0)
(define (f x) x)
(define an-s (s f))
(define g (procedure-rename an-s 'g))
(object-name g)
(g 1 2)

=> 

'g
procedure f: expects 1 argument, given 2: 1 2
