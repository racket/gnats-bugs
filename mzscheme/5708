 I wonder whether the confusion is between `current-print' and
 `global-port-print-handler'?
 
 In any case, the "a" above is before the second prompt.

 Yes! That's my confusion.

 Yeah, I saw that one. I expected another one (due to my confusion
 above).
 
 In some sense, the real cause of the stepper printing bug (that I fixed
 in a funny way for v201) is that the global-port-print-handler is not
 being set as part of the tool-infrastructure "set up all of the
 parameters based on the language<%> object" function (aka
 drscheme:eval:expand-program if you care to look at the docs).
 
 This parameter isn't set because it takes into account the actual
 output ports that go into to a text% object (to insert images).
 
 To make a long story short, I wonder if mred might support output ports
 that are text% objects in addition to input ports. Then, it could
 redirect snips into the right places.
 
 All of the infrastrure isn't there yet in mz and mr to do this, since
 something like `display' and `write' must not turn the snips into
 strings before putting them in the editor, but perhaps this is
 something to think about for v202. DrScheme always is careful to use
 the pretty-printer and sets the pretty-print-print-hook and
 pretty-print-size-hook to do the image insertion (Of course, pretty
 print gets the sizes wrong -- it just counts the snips as width 1,
 which isn't always right).
