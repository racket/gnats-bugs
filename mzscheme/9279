>Description:
When in r6rs language mode, unsyntax-splicing fails.

I presume this is due to syntax objects in r6rs being mutable lists, while unsyntax-splicing is still expecting immutable lists.
>How-To-Repeat:
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs))

(define-syntax foo
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ args ...)
       #`(display #,@#'(args ...))])))

(foo 5)


fails during expansion:

broken.ss:8:9: application: bad syntax (illegal use of `.') in: (display . {#<syntax:broken.ss:10:5>})

Reason>>> Fixed in SVN

Thanks for the report!
