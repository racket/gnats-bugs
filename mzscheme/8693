>Description:
The macros described in Section 3.1.4 of Inside PLT MzScheme for "guiding" xform are incorrectly named (in the docs or in the source).  For example, the documentation talks about XFORM_BEGIN_SKIP and XFORM_END_SKIP, but xform wants START_XFORM_SKIP and END_XFORM_SKIP.  Without grep-ing the source code for MzScheme, it's not possible to tell what the names of the macros really are.

 MzScheme uses old variants; XFORM_START_SKIP and XFORM_END_SKIP are the
 right names (i.e., "START" instead of "BEGIN").
