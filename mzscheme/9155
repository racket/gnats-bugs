>Description:
In the following code, there is a discrepancy between the name of the optional keyword argument on test0 (#:b) and its contract (#:c):

    #lang scheme/base

    (require scheme/contract)

    (define (test0 a b)
      (list a b))

    (define (test1 #:a a #:b [b #f])
      (list a b))

    (provide/contract [test1 (->* (#:a integer?) (#:c integer?) list?)])

When the code is compiled, however, the contract library provides the following error message, which suggests misleadingly that the problem is elsewhere:

    test.ss:11:19: /Users/dave/Desktop/test.ss:11:19: #<path:/Users/dave/Desktop/test.ss> broke the contract 
    (->* (#:a integer?) (#:c integer?) list?)
    on test1; expected a procedure that accepts no ordinary arguments and the mandatory keyword #:a, given:     
    #<procedure:test1>
>How-To-Repeat:
>Fix:
I had forgotten to include the optional keywords in the error message. 
>Release-Note:
This was not a contract violation, nor would it have been a type error.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "robby" by robby at Sat, 19 Jan 2008 13:01:32 -0500
Reason>>> rbf

State changed from "open" to "closed" by robby at Sat, 19 Jan 2008 13:01:32 -0500
Reason>>> Fixed and relased to SVN. The error message is now:

/Users/robby/tmp.ss:3:19: (file "/Users/robby/tmp.ss") broke
the contract 
  (->* (#:a integer?) (#:c integer?) list?)
on test1; expected a procedure that accepts no ordinary
arguments, the mandatory keyword #:a, and the optional
keyword #:c, given: #<procedure:test1>
