 I think you're running into a general problem with our Makefiles: they
 don't work right with paths that contain a space.
 
 For now, can you try building in and to a directory that doesn't
 contain a space in its path?

 Bingo.
 
 Do you want to add a note about this in the readme? It seems the
 easiest way to fix this. Something like this perhaps? :
 
 "
 To compile with Cygwin tools, follow the Unix instructions below, and
 be sure to configure with --enable-shared. The result is a Unix-style
 build, not a Windows-style build (e.g., MzScheme's `system-type'
 procedure returns 'unix, not 'windows, and MrEd uses X11).

 It's probably irrelevant, but you know that svn is no longer updated,
 right?

 There wasn't a proper announcement, but it was pretty hard to miss all
 the git-related traffic, the commit messages (that you should
 receive), and the lack of any changes on svn...  (I'll post one now,
 just in case.)

 No, I did not know that. On April 16 you said:

 I did receive them. I just assumed that all those changes were being
 tunneled to svn.

 I don't usually hack on the code. I just came here to help with the
 alpha testing.

 Now I get "libtool: link: cannot find the library
 `../racket/libgracket.la' or unhandled argument
 `../racket/libgracket.la'"
 
 Here's my bash history and the tail of the compilation output.
