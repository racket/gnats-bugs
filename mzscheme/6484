>Description:
When requiring a file that does not exists the error message
does not highlight the source code that required the file.
When requiring a file that requires a file that does not exist
this error becomes very hard to fix without a link to jump to
the location.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a module A in one file and require B.
Make a module B in another file and require a bogus file.
Syntax check module A

 No, it is a mzscheme bug (technically, a feature request, given the
 current infrastructure -- not that that matters.)
 
 I moved it over.

 This is still an issue.  It's actually worse under DrRacket, because
 it exposes an internal error message.
 
 Given two files, a.rkt and b.rkt, with the following content:
 
 ;;; a.rkt
 #lang racket
 (require "b.rkt")
 
 
 ;;; b.rkt
 #lang racket
 (require "c.rkt")
 
 
 
 Trying to run a.rkt produces the following error in console racket:
 
 128-110-69-75:Desktop dyoo$ racket a.rkt
 default-load-handler: cannot open input file
   path: /Users/dyoo/Desktop/c.rkt
   system error: No such file or directory; errno=2
   context...:
    standard-module-name-resolver
    standard-module-name-resolver
    standard-module-name-resolver
 
 
 
 Trying to run a.rkt under DrRacket, however, produces the following error:
 
 . . ../local/racket/collects/mred/private/snipfile.rkt:324:2:
 open-input-file: cannot open input file
   path: /Users/dyoo/Desktop/c.rkt
   system error: No such file or directory; errno=2
 
 where now DrRacket is reporting the source of the error as coming from
 'snipfile.rkt' rather than the module loader.
 
 
 In either case, there's no source highlighting to help isolate where
 the error is happening.
