>Description:
The documentation of the substring function is in the PLT MzScheme manual's 3.5  Strings section:
"(substring string start-k [end-k]) returns a mutable string, even if the string argument is immutable. The end-k argument defaults to (string-length string)"

Before bug-free usage of this function it would be necessary for a programmer to determine 4 other data points: if start-k and end-k are 0 or 1 based and if a given range would be interpreted as being inclusive or exclusive at either end.

(It appears that the indexing is as given in the beginner's manual--zero based indexing and the end-k'th char is excluded.)
