>Description:
We are using Steve Bloch's suggestion to use strings
for test cases: for instance
(foo 23) "should be 44.65"
Works great.  Sometimes, computing the number is
non-trivial (eg, when it involves pi), so we tell
people to use the calculator they already have.  They do.
And they get

  read: found non-character while reading a string

I think this should be treated as a bug -- this should
be a reasonable operation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compute (* 5 2.1) in the REPL.  Now copy and paste 
the resulting 10.5 into the Definitions window:

  "should be 10.5"

Click execute, observe error (at least in Beginner).

(Note that this is a problem for 10.5 but not for 
(* 5 2) = 10.  The entire "10.5" is treated as a
single character, presumably to support fractions,
while the "10" from (* 5 2) is treated as two
separate characters.  Counter-intuitively, you can
paste the 10.5 in, but you can't position the
cursor anywhere in it to modify it slightly.  But
this isn't a problem if the number is inexact, eg,
(* pi 3).)
