>Description:
For example: run code that overflows ram and goes trashing.
Break it, then evaluate a simple expression with low
ram requirements, for example by switching to another
window with code with low memory load and pressing the
execute button. MzScheme keeps on trashing even after
multiple incurrences of the garbage collector as visualized
by the recycling icon.
May be I have not well customized my system (windows 98).
I run in 64 Mb ram. I would not know how to customize my
system anyway. Do you have any clues? System monitor shows
that almost all of t64 Mb ram is indeed used. No trashing
after completely quitting and relaunching MzScheme.
So I suspect it is not Windows 98 that keeps on trashing.
Kind regards,
Jos Koot.

 Yep. We're in the midst of a gradual architecture restructuring (mainly
 changing the GC model) to solve these kinds of problems.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
