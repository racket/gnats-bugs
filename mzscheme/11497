>Description:
The error messages produced from invalid locations of . delimiters in lists are inconsistent in terms of what kind of quotes are used, and the message for one combination is incorrect.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type the following examples in the REPL (I was using DrRacket in #lang racket mode and "Determine language from source"):

> '(1 . 2 .)
output: <Stop> read: illegal use of `)'
The error highlights the first "." in the input, even though the error message refers to ")".

> '(. 1)
output: <Stop> read: illegal use of "."
> '(1 . 2 3)
output: <Stop> read: illegal use of `.'
These messages are otherwise correct but note that they use different quotation marks.

As a feature request, it might be nice to have '(1 . 2 .) work as '(2 1) to match the behavior of '(1 . 2 . 3) as '(2 1 3).
