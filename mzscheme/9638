>Description:
The documentation for `map' in pairs.scrbl begins:

"Applies proc to the elements of the lsts from the first elements to the last, returning #f as soon as any application returns #f."

That's not the behavior of map.

Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 28 Jul 2008 12:38:06 -0400
Reason>>> All I did was remove "returning @scheme[#f] as soon as any
application returns @scheme[#f]" -- since there was already
a description of the result.
