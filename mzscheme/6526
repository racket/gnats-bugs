 Hello again,
 
 Your newest bug report made me realize what went wrong here: the
 Makefiles are not set up properly for building 3m with --enable-shared.
 
 I'll work on this for the next release. Meanwhile, if you'd like to try
 3m, configure without --enable-shared.
 
 Matthew

 Actually, make that v299. I haven't back-patched for v208.
