 I'm not sure what's the best way to fix this.  Changing it to double
 quotes will be inconsistent with a bunch of other places that use
 single quotes -- and single quotes are usually preferred on unix
 command lines, since they quote more strongly than double quotes.
 
 Maybe a comment about quoting stuff should be added?

 A comment might be good.
 
 The goal of the comment would be to remind people that one their
 respective shells they should use the appropriate quotes.
 
 That said, the thing is that I got so into the habit of copying and
 pasting code, I didn't even think about it. Perhaps my personalized
 comment  to myself should be "Maintain attention to detail" :).
