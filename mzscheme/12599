>Description:
I noticed at:

http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Byte_and_String_Input.html?q=read-bytes#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._peek-byte-or-special%29%29

The documentation for peek-byte-or-special incorrectly shows the return type as:

 (or/c character? eof-object? any/c)

I believe it should be:

 (or/c byte? eof-object? any/c)
