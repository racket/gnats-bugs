>Description:
This is a bug report (feature request, actually) related to
the DrScheme system RNG requesting support for saving
internal state.

Package: mzscheme
Version: 203-5
Severity: normal

  The RNG provided with mzscheme doesn't export any
interface by which code can save and restore its internal 
state.  This would be useful for a number of reasons, 
including one that is staring at me right now (I'm
actually implementing my own toy RNG to get around it for 
the time being, since the program doesn't need even 
moderately high-quality random numbers)

    supports this. Search for random-generator in the docs.
