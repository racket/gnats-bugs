 Building a GUI isn't the problem. Any program that includes the db package crashes "creating executable for distribution.
 
 Example:
 
 -------------------
 #lang racket
 (require db)
 (display "hello")
 -------------------

 I tried this using "raco exe", which attempted to eat all available 
 memory. I think this is the essence of the problem:
 
 a.rkt:
 
 #lang racket/base
 (require "b.rkt")
 
 b.rkt:
 
 #lang racket/base
 (require racket/runtime-path)
 (define-runtime-module-path-index a-mod "a.rkt")

 I was able to make a distribution again with Racket version 5.2.0.1. You probably want to close this bug report?

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 10 Oct 2011 20:28:22 -0400
Reason>>> Reported fine, probably due to Matthew's recent fixes in this 
area.
