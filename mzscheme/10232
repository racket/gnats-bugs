>Description:
Document/code discrepancy: make-weak-custom-hash
(from scheme/dict) returns an immutable hash
although the docs suggest it should return a 
mutable one.

It looks to me an error in the code. I'm using
PLT 4.1.4.1, but the same lines are present in
trunk. I've included a patch in "steps to 
reproduce" that seems to do the job, but I
haven't tested it thoroughly.

Cheers,

 Thanks for the patch!
 
 There's another problem: weakness in the table is based on the "box"
 used to set the comparison operations, instead of the value in the box.
 So the weak hash table never holds onto anything, even if they key
 stays reachable. I've fixed that part by adding a weak hash table that
 map from the real key to the operation-setting box.
