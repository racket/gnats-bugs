>Description:
The following code shows how define-ffi-definer does not produce procedures with well defined names. I think it should use the identifier it is given to name the procedure.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang racket
(require (except-in ffi/unsafe malloc))
(require ffi/unsafe/define)
(define libc (ffi-lib "libc"))
(define-ffi-definer define-libc libc)
(define-libc malloc (_fun _int -> _pointer))
(define renamed-malloc (procedure-rename malloc 'malloc))
malloc
renamed-malloc
