>Description:
I have am trying to build one of the pre-release mzscheme (unix) code on Windows 2000. I used the GNU toolchain to build it under cygwin.

Errors are listed below:

make xobjects

 Either:
 
  * run configure with --enable-cgcdefault, or 
 
  * make and install with `make cgc' and `make install-cgc'
 
 The latter produces binaries with names suffixed by "CGC".
 
 For Cygwin, --enable-cgcdefault should be the default, and we'll fix
 the configure script.
 
 The problem is that the default build mode now uses "3m" memory
 management, but 3m is not yet supported for Cygwin (and likely won't be
 anytime soon). But this fact is neither properly documented nor
 correctly handled by `configure'.

 Part of the Windows build creates cygwin-compatible libraries --
 should it be removed then?

Reason>>> mzscheme, probably to be closed or `analyzed'



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:42:42 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
