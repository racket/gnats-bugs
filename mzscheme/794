>Description:
Mac MzScheme won't quit until `send-event' returns. It would be nice
if it obeyed the quit menu, even during a call to send-event. Currently,
it just remembers that you quit, and when the event returns, it quits.
This time can be very long. OzTeX does not return a value for the "open"
apple event until it finishes texing the file. So, if the file has an
error, it will even wait for user input before returning a reply to
the apple event.

 You're able to select the "File|Quit" menu item, or you hit Cmd-Q and
 it eventually quits?

 the more I think about it, even if you're abel to select "File|Quit", 
 you'd probably be able to do that in MzScheme/Mac if you're evaluating
   (let loop () (loop))
 
 What happens in that case (i.e., does it act like `send-event')?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Both. I can select file|quit and nothing happens, and I hit cmd-q and
 nothing happens. But, in both cases, when OzTeX returns the result,
 mzscheme quits (like it has buffered the event).

 Yes, exactly the same. (I guess I should have tried that one!)

 Ok, so there's nothing special about send-event. I'm not sure I can do
 anything about selecting "Quit" without breaking on the Mac, but I'll
 look into it. Consider using MrEd instead.

 When I type cmd-. and mzscheme is waiting for the event to return, it
 doesn' say "user break". However, it does break.  This may be becuase I
 have turned on the "no repl" command line argument.

 More likely it's just MzScheme/Mac brokenness. It's a lower-level
 break than MzScheme's break (which, unfortunately, I have no way to
 turn off).
