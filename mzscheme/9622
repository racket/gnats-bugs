>Description:
At the beginning of Guide: PLT Scheme, Section 4.12, after give syntactic form of case, says:

    Since eqv? doesnâ€™t work on many kinds of values, notably symbols and lists, each datum is 
    typically a number, symbol, or boolean.

Because eqv? doesn't work on *symbol*, datum shouldn't be *symbol*.
>How-To-Repeat:
Read the document slowly :-)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Tue, 22 Jul 2008 10:39:32 -0400
Reason>>> The first "symbols" should have been "strings" --- fixed in svn

Thanks once again!
