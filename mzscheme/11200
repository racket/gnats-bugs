>Description:
Running a subprocess can leave a zombie.  I've seen this happen only with an Emacs subprocess, as done below.  In that code, the
`subprocess-wait' is blocking forever, and when this happens, `ps'
shows the emacs process as defunct.

It's a new problem, so I've bisected it, and got to an unsurprising
commit that broke it: 04fa6c6a, with a commit log specifying three
things that all look suspicious.
>How-To-Repeat:
#lang mzscheme
(define-values [subp out in err]
  (subprocess (current-output-port)
              (current-input-port)
              (current-error-port)
              "/usr/bin/emacs"
              "-q"))
(subprocess-wait subp)

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by mflatt at Sat, 08 Jan 2011 10:50:56 -0500
Reason>>> The problem seems to be the Racket strategy for dealing
with process groups, which involves calling waitpid()
with 0 to check for processes not created with their
own group. Emacs, however, moves itself into a new group,
so when Racket looks for completed children in its own
group, it finds none.

I don't know the solution, yet.
