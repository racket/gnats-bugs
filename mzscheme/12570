Responsible changed from "mflatt" to "eli" by eli at Mon, 07 May 2012 21:04:29 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 07 May 2012 21:04:29 -0400
Reason>>> You probably have a different libreadline version installed -- we had
several people mention this when their distro has 6 instead of 5.  It's
easy to change the code so it tries v6 if it exists, but nobody has
confirmed yet that it doesn't break anything.  (See the post I just
made on the dev list.)  I'll close this and wait for the confirmation
there before I commit this change.
