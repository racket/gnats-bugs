>Description:
I run a fairly generic Ubuntu 8.04 (64-bit). While using DrScheme 4.1 (non-Unix install from the self-installing shell script) I was unable to fetch .plt files for installation. Furthermore, if I downloaded the plugin and installed from File, the plugin would install but could not connect to remote servers. My network connectivity was fine.

Wiping out the DrScheme installation and building from source solved this problem.

Error message:

tcp-connect: connection to www.ccs.neu.edu, port 80 failed; host not found (at step 1: Name or service not known; errno=-2)

3. Installer fails with above error message.

 Sorry, I can't -- the original URL has long since disappeared.
