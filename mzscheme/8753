(eqv? a b) ; --> #t

>Audit-Trail:
Class changed from "support" to "doc-bug" by mflatt at Sat, 16 Jun 2007 18:01:59 -0400
Reason>>> docs were wrong

State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Sat, 16 Jun 2007 18:01:59 -0400
Reason>>> The docs were wrong - fixed for the next build (to say
that Latin-1 chars are eq? when they are char=?, but
not in general).

Thanks,
Matthew
