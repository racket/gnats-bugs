 Okay, Matthew: how does that look? (its not really quoted printable,
 since I dont do softline breaks)

 [ I'm mostly writing to make sure we're not in the "everyone is
 expecting someone else to do something" state. ]
 
 So, what is the status of the quoted printable bug reports?
 
 I'm now getting two emails per bug report -- is that what Eli meant in
 his earlier message?
 
 Also, Matthew sent an example message with Chinese that worked -- is
 someone planning to do something like that to the messages that gnats
 sent?
 
 Note that it is possible to edit those messages; when we first
 started, they didn't have urls in them, but they do now, thanks to
 someone hacking on gnats.
 
 Does anyone have anything about this on their list of things to do?
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 FWIW, setting the Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding won't make
 the subject line readable.
 
 For header fields, you have to use something like
 `encode-line-for-header' in "unihead.ss". My guess is that this isn't
 an option, though, because the same encoded text is probably used for
 both the header and body.

 Yes, that's right.
 
 Is the encode-line-for-header function something that just does a
 regular encoding with a few special characters at the beginning or
 end? If so, maybe those could be added afterwards?
