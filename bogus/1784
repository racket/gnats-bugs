>Description:
I'm running DrScheme on a Debian system. Whily updating a package xclient-base
I now miss all Text in DrScheme, no text any longer in Menus under the Buttons 
anywhere.

The strange thing is that other programm still works. And show text. 
I may build my system back, but I think this could be a bug.

Regards
Friedrich
>How-To-Repeat:
update Debian systems xclient stuff and the text is gone
