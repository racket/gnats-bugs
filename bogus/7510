To whom it may concern:

I am writing from Morgan Kaufmann Publishers in regards to our forthcoming book, Michael Scott's Programming Language Pragmatics, 2E. As part of the CD supplement to the book, we are including a list of high quality sources for programming language tutorials, reference manuals, and other resources. We are requesting nonexclusive permission to include your site with a brief description:

http://www.plt-scheme.org/
Source of the PLT Scheme implementation, widely used for teaching.

Because our publication schedules are tight, I would appreciate your letting me know if we can list your site by next Wednesday, August 3. If you need more information or have any questions about this, please feel free to contact me.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards, 

Valerie Witte

 You are welcome to do so.
 
 In return, I request that you send me a paper copy of the fact that you 
 did, which I can then submit to NSF when I request funds to maintain 
 our software. Perhaps both you and Michael Scott can send letters 
 independently. If you can do so by August 10, that would be ideal. I 
 include a formal signature with address below.
 
 Thank you very much. -- Matthias
