>Description:
 My browser setting used to work as it is, that is why I thought it's a
 bug.  Looking at drscheme preferences/browser tab again, I'm not sure
 anymore.  Maybe you can add a note about quoting to the text there
 (explanation at the command-line item).
 
 Regarding unix-browser-list; you're right, I just thought it was
 unnecessary.
 
 Thanks.
