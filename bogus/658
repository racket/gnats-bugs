>Description:
Our plt-gnats submission mechanism is broken.  Furthermore, it is
silently broken, so people submitting bugs have no idea that their bug 
submission failed; all they receive is the "thanks for submitting"
message, then the submission is lost.

I'm going to be submitting several of these test messages to figure
out what went wrong.  Please ignore them.
