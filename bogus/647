 An alternative, which I prefer, is to put viewports in their own
 eventspace. Otherwise, calling ready-mouse-click will have strange
 effects for programs that mix viewports with other event-based
 objects.
 
 Conceptually, a separate eventspace make sense because viewports
 essentialy implement thier own event queues, and the user has control
 over when those events are handled. In other words, there are no
 event-based callbacks, so there's no need to keep the viewport in the
 same eventspace as anything else.
