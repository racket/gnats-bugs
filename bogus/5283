 No such change has occurred, to the best of my knowledge.  In fact, 
 if you're using the pre-built binary, you can see on the web page 
 that it has not changed since February 8.  To make sure that we're 
 both talking about the same version of MrEd, though, I will upload 
 the latest latest build.
 
 I have noticed sporadic slowdown myself, and I believe that it's 
 often related to non-MrEd load.  That is, MrEd is far more sensitive 
 than it should be to the CPU time consumed by other applications. 
 For instance, I've noticed that Internet Connect can be a terrible 
 CPU hog, consuming up to 20 or 30% when I have my Airport card 
 connected.  (Numbers are approximate, b/c I don't have an Airport 
 card on this machine.
 
 It's certainly true that MrEd event-handling is sub-par, but I don't 
 believe any recent changes would have affected that.
