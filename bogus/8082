>Description:
After clicking check syntax on a large file (collects/errortrace/errortrace-lib.ss, if it helps) I right-clicked on an identifier (errortrace-annotate) and DrScheme gave me this internal error message: 

send: no such method: get-frame for class: definitions-canvas%

 === context ===
/var/tmp/trunk/collects/mzlib/private/class-internal.ss:3124:2: obj-error
/var/tmp/trunk/collects/drscheme/private/unit.ss:604:9
...amework/framework.ss:978:6
...amework/framework.ss:978:6

call-with-break-parameterization
/var/tmp/trunk/collects/mred/private/lock.ss:40:2: as-entry

After this message, that tab went blank and was useless. (I was able to open up new tabs and continue working without having DrScheme behave oddly in any other way, though.)
>How-To-Repeat:
I can't reproduce this bug at all. I hoped that maybe the error message and context information might be enough to go on.
