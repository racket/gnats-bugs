>Description:
It's there in the summary: if you call rational? on certain irrational real numbers, such as pi or (sqrt 2) (or sqrt of anything else afaict), it still returns true.  It does return false for things which aren't numbers at all, and at least numbers that are imaginary or complex.

This also occurs in 5.0.1 on Windows.  The given test case is for general racket, but it (obviously?) also affects all the teaching languages, which is where one of my students first discovered it.

 This is the intended behavior. To quote the reference:
 
   "[A]ll of the real numbers that can be represented are also rational
 numbers, except for +inf.0 (positive infinity), -inf.0 (negative

 The intuition is that the sqrt function returns a nearby rational that
 can actually be represented.

 It sure is an intuition but the first time I encountered this (1987) I =
 was furious. Why bother with exact/inexact when in the end all reals are =
 rationals anyway. So was my thinking ...=20

 Ouch.  I am, of course, aware of how floating-point numbers are stored
 and how floats work elsewhere, but I had thought this was one of the
 things about numbers that was fixed in Scheme (let alone Racket).  I
 guess in my head I was thinking of rational? as an and of rational? and
 exact?.  It seems strange that real? and rational? are just synonyms
 (well, except for the infinities and the not-a-numbers, which apparently
 *are* considered real? numbers, which is even stranger, in a way).
 
 Anyway, "feature not a bug", ok.  I'll work on how to explain that to my
 students, including the math major that discovered this.

 Unfortunately, floating point numbers do not actually represent any
 irrational values -- and they can be just as imprecise for rational
 values as irrational ones.  There's no way of looking at a floating
 point number and knowing whether the precise value it approximates
 should have been rational or irrational, so the predicates can only
 respond about the imprecise value it actually represents.  Which is
 always rational.  You can always ask IEEE why they did not use some of
 the NaN space to represent pi, e, and various roots.  ;)

 It seems like a nice jumping off point to talk about the computable
 reals (at least with your math major).
