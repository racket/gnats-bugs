 I decided to mail you directly when I realized that it's likely that
 you know about it, but hit submit instead of cancel.  I closed this
 bug as bogus.

 It does -- and I aborted because I realized that Robby knows about it,
 so there's no point in filing it.

 Was this PR aborted because you figured out the reason? My  
 recollection is that this happens on *every* error when debugging is  
 turned off.

 DrScheme was trying to identify the beginning of the stack (its own
 setup code that is wrapped around calls to the user's program) and
 elide it from the stacktrace. That broke somewhere along the way and
 that's what that error message was about.
 
 I've just disabled that for now.
