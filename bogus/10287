 Note the change -- instead of mailing each an every person in the bug
 database, there is now a single `bug-notification@plt-scheme.org'
 email that should reach the same people.  I did this change after a
 reply I sent this morning bounced back from google, referring to a
 page about how to do bulk emailing.  (Perhaps the list has become too
 long, or maybe google is more strict.)
