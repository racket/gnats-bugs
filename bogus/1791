>Description:
I have a skiplist, but I don't know how to make the auxiliary list that stores search path. what I can do is only to get the auxiliary lists of nodes and pointers of the nodes. can you response me as soon as possible?
>How-To-Repeat:
(define (aunode m node aux)
  (if (= m (car node))
      (cons node aux)
      aux))

 
(define (aupointer m plist au)
  (cond ((< m (get-value (car plist)))
         #f)
        ((and (> m (get-value (car plist)))
              (< m (get-value (cadr plist))))
         (aupointer m (get-pointer plist) au))
        ((= m (get-value (car plist)))
         (cons (car plist) au))
        (else (aupointer m (get-pointer plist) au))))
(define (get-value s)
  (car s))
(define (get-pointer s)
  (cdr s))
