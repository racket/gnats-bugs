windows "Windows NT 5.0 (Build 2195) Service Pack 2" (win32\i386) (get-display-depth) = 32
Tools: "collection-path: collection \"drscheme\" does not have sub-collection: \"tools\" in: \"c:\\\\progra~1\\\\plt\\\\.\\\\collects\\\\setup\\\\..\\\\..\\\\collects\\\\drscheme\""

>Description:
When you ask to show synthesized info on an 800x600 screen,
the resulting window is too large to fit on screen.
Moving the top of the window off-screen doesn't seem to
help: there's no "Submit" / "Cancel" at the bottom. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Use 800x600.
Help | Help Desk | Submit a Bug Report.
Show Synthesized Info.
Resulting window is too large.  The last thing on
screen (given the default window posn) is 
Docs Installed.  When I move top off the top of
the screen, the last item is still Teachpacks.
I don't see a Submit/Cancel at the bottom.

One thing that would definitely help is if a "Hide 
Synthesized Info" button appeared at the top.  Really,
you should get a scroll-bar down the side ...
