>Description:
Why is it that when the hardButton is clicked and hard variable is set to 20 it does not produce the expected result when i go to the ChoosePeg frame. In fact, if I put a (display hard) in the ChoosePeg frame, it does not display anything after I've gone through  clicking hardButton
>How-To-Repeat:
(define hard 10)

(define hardButton(instantiate button%() (label hardpic)   (parent DifficultyMenu)(callback (lambda(button event)
(cond((= (message-box/custom "Question" "Do you want to continue?" "opo" "hindi po" #f #f '(no-default)#f) 1)(set! hard 20)(send DifficultyMenu show #f)(send MainMenu show #t)))))))

(define ChoosePeg(instantiate frame%(label "ChoosePeg")(parent MainMenu)))
(if (= hard 20)(instantiate button%() (label six)(parent pane1)(callback(lambda(button event)(send ChoosePeg show #f)))))

 It's difficult to help you with your problem.  This is because the 
 program you've supplied is an incomplete fragment.  It contains unbound 
 references to hardpic, DifficultyMenu, MainMenu, six, and pane1.  Also, 
 there appears to be a missing pair of parens after the 'instantiate 
 frame%'.
 
 Presumably, the reason you didn't submit a complete program is because 
 it would be very large.  This is entirely reasonable, but the best 
 solution is probably to try to simplify your program until either it 
 becomes small enough to fit in a bug report, or you discover the source 
 of the problem.
 
 If I had to guess at the problem, I would say that the last expression 
 in your fragment (of the form '(if (= hard 20) ...)') looks very 
 suspicious.  In particular, in a GUI-type program, you would expect to 
 see only initialization code at the top level.  Are you imagining a 
 declarative mechanism where this expression would be evaluated whenever 
 hard gets set to 20?
 
 Hope this helps,
