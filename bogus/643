State-Changed-When: Fri Apr 18 17:02:12 2003
State-Changed-Why:
    Cmd-~ solves this in OS X (>= 10.2 ?).
    The problem will never be addresses for Classic, most likely.
Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by eli at Sun, 04 Mar 2012 20:52:52 -0500
Reason>>> Looks like this is some garbled text -- there's no actual bug 
description.

State changed from "suspended" to "closed" by eli at Sun, 04 Mar 2012 20:52:52 -0500

 Well, it turns out that the problem with this program
 
 (open-graphics)
 
 (define w (open-viewport "Bug" 500 500))
 
 (define (L)
  (printf "start~n")
  (let L () (printf "  looping~n") (unless (ready-mouse-click w) (L)))
  (printf "stop!~n"))
 
 (L)
 
 is due to the change that you suggested in the event loop. Since the
 evaluation of the "L" loop is on the event handler thread, no clicks will
 ever enter the queue. I plan to fix it with judicious use of wx:yield....
 
 On the macintosh, this program locks up MrEd. Since the "w" window appears
 on top of the drscheme window, I cannot click on break. I cannot move the
 window, either. On other platforms, I would be able to move the window. Is
 that fixable? I had to use "cmd-option-esc" to kill mred.
