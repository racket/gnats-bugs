>Description:
The following program in the definitions window will error out:

#lang racket/base
(require 2htdp/image)
step-count?


However, if one does the following in Definitions:

     #lang racket/base
     (require 2htdp/image)

and then try this at interactions:

    > step-count?

then step-count? appears to be bound.  Something seriously weird is happening.

 This is pretty confusing to me too.
 
 I think that the right behavior should have been for
 provide-primitives to signal an error because step-count? is not
 bound. (But I have no clue how it actually finds a value for it
 later!)
 
 Also, my attempts to make a smaller example aren't going so well, but
 the code isn't too too big, so maybe someone that is familiar with
 provide-primitives will take a look.

 The `define-primitive'-generated macro is returning a wrapper
 procedure.
