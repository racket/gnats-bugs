 (sorry about the email, but can't reach though other means right now)
 
 Just noticed that something has recently changed to makes the user interface
 very very slow, unless I continuously move the mouse around, so I conjecture
 that someone changed the event handling code recently (within the last day
 or two), and now very little time is being allocated to useful execution.
 
 Any chance of refining things to achieve the performance more reminiscent of
 earlier releases. (I'm running OSX, but since things haven't really changed
 there much, it's likely related to more generic changes).
 
 Thanks, -paul-
