State-Changed-Why:

Class changed from "sw-bug" to "not-a-bug" by eli at Sun, 04 Mar 2012 20:58:29 -0500
Reason>>> Random email, not a bug.

>Unformatted:
 Automatic mailing of GNATS reports should be
 working again.  
 
 There were two problems that conspired to break our 
 setup.  One was that the machine running the crontab
 entry in my account had failed.  The other was
 that the CS mail upgrade didn't handle the
 GNATS alias.
 
 Apparently, the bug reports were filed in the
 database, though mail was not sent.  I'm going
 to send the last few reports by hand.  Use
 edit-pr if you want to claim them.
