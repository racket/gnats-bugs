 I haven't been able to reproduce this bug on the current HEAD of the 
 master branch, the most recent nightly build, or the most recent release 
 build (happily). I'm also a little confused by the version string 
 DrRacket prints out; I don't know what the dash means, and I wonder if 
 it means you need to re-run setup.
 
 Are you running a nightly build or a git checkout? If the latter, master 
 or gr2, and is the error still present if you run "raco setup"?

 The "5.0.2.1--2010-10-25(-/f)" version means:
 
 * Version 5.0.2.1
 
 * Built from a full source tree (otherwise it wouldn't have anything
   other than the version).
 
 * No commit sha1 available (so not building from a git repo, or an
   archive generated from a git repo),
 
 * So you only see the date of the time stamp file (as a very rough
   indication of when it was retreived) -- the "/f" suffix means that
   this is how the date was made, unlike "/a" which is the date made by
   git or a git-made archive.

 git checkout.  I followed the instructions for building and installing, 
 which doesn't include running raco setup.  When I do that, the error 
 goes away.

 "make install" effectively runs "raco setup" as its last step. I'm still 
 puzzled how you got into that state, especially given Eli's explanation 
 of version strings. Did you start DrRacket before "make install" 
 finished? That's the only other thing I can think of.

 IIRC, you also get this when opening the .app package in Mac OS X =
 instead of running drracket from the command line.

 That shouldn't make any difference -- if you can make this happen I'll
 be interested to see what's wrong.

 Just tried it two ways: launching directly from the Dock and by finding =
 the .app package in the Finder and launching it there.  Both ways failed =
 to pick up the git information.  Feel free to drop by my desk to try =
 things.
