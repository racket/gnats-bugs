Class changed from "sw-bug" to "duplicate" by eli at Mon, 26 Mar 2012 06:43:32 -0400
Reason>>> Duplicate of PR 12646

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Mon, 26 Mar 2012 06:43:32 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 26 Mar 2012 06:43:32 -0400

screen for today.  This is already reported in PR 12646, so I'm closing
it.
