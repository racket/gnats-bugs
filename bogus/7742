>Description:
I downloaded the source from three different mirrors. Each time I was told that the archive was invalid.

Running:
gunzip < mz-299.400-src-unix.tgz | tar xvf -
Yields:
[...trace until...]
x plt/collects/compiler/private/closure.ss, 9306 bytes, 19 tape blocks

gunzip: stin: invalid compressed data--crc error
[end]

I tried uncompressing the files using winzip as well and received a similar failure.

I listed this as critical since it is a showstopper if no one can actually install the archive. I've listed it under support since it isn't a software error but a maintenance error. I looked on the mailing list and saw no discussion in December for "crc", "archive", or similar naive searches.

 I had the crc error with the 209 Unix source from the
 Northeastern University download mirror.
 
 I'm using gunzip 1.2.4 if that matters (it shouldn't).

 You can close this.
 I ftp'd the file to my UNIX box and didn't send the
 tgz as a bin file, so it corrupted the volume on the
 way.
 
 I've since corrected my mistake.
