 How about something like:
 
 - start drscheme
 - set "reuse..."
 - "open here..." /Applications/PLT/collects/browser/browser.ss
   > which should display the file in the window
 - "open here..." /Applications/PLT/collects/browser/browser-sig.ss
   > on my machine the window title updates, but the content doesn't.
 - "open recent..." /Applications/PLT/collects/browser/browser.ss
   > title switches back, still no change in window frame contents.
 - "open recent..." /Applications/PLT/collects/browser/browser-sig.ss
   > same, title switches, and again window frame content does not.
 
 (this consistently happens on both the released and prerelease version)
 
 Thanks, -paul-
