>Description:
Shriram asked me to look at his book again, so I downloaded both the
stable 209 and the alpha 299, using 
sh plt-299.200-bin-i386-linux.sh 
sh plt-209-bin-i386-linux.sh.

In 209, things work as usual: I can select something with 
select-forward-sexp
and then paste it with 
paste-clipboard.

This is broken in 299.  



That's very nice: I always compiled DrScheme from Unix sources before,
and now that gives me compilation errors (we're using a RHEL clone).  

Now using 299.200: 

drscheme &

type "foo" and up-arrow, so cursor is at the beginning of "foo".

Type Esc-Shift-Right (bound to select-forward-sexp) to select the sexp
foo.

Type down-arrow and Shift-Insert (bound to paste-clipboard) to paste
the sexp "foo".

Nothing happens.  (Or at least if something does get pasted in, it's
often not "foo", but something else.)

But "foo" should have been pasted in, or so I believe from earlier
versions of drscheme.  In the stable version 209, it does get pasted
in.  Now I can paste in "foo" by clicking middle-mouse.

 209 was the broken one, actually, because it did not distinguish
 between the X select and the X clipboard.
 
 The 299 series behaves like other modern X apps. The middle button
 copies the current selection, while pasting copies the clipboard.
 
 To get the old behavior, you can add teh following to your
 "plt-prefs.ss" file:
 
  (|MrEd:selectionAsClipboard| #t)

 Thanks, Matthew!  But doesn't Emacs behave in my non-modern-X way?
 C-y will paste whatever middle-mouse pastes, right?  More to the
 point, C-y will paste a sexp after M-x copy-sexp or Esc-C-k.
 
 And what's the modern-X way to use Drscheme?  Seems like in 299 I need
 to do this:
 select-forward-sexp 
 C-c (or M-w)
 to be able to paste this sexp with C-v or Shift-Insert.  That extra
 C-c (or M-w) sounds inconvenient.
 
 I do this select-forward-sexp/paste-clipboard so often that I've bound
 these functions to keys
 
  	      (map "insert" "paste-clipboard")
              (send keymap map-function "f12" "select-forward-sexp")
              (send keymap map-function "c:f12" "select-backward-sexp")
 
 in keymap.ss & scheme.ss.  
 
    To get the old behavior, you can add the following to your
    "plt-prefs.ss" file:
 
     (|MrEd:selectionAsClipboard| #t)
 
 Thanks.  But it didn't work for me.  My file ~/.plt-prefs.ss now reads
 
 (
  (|MrEd:selectionAsClipboard| #t)
  (plt:hd:user-email "richter@math.northwestern.edu")
  (plt:hd:user-name "Bill Richter")
 ...
 )
 
 but the 299.200 behavior is the same:  
 
 Shift-Insert (bound to paste-clipboard) 
 does not paste what was just selected with
 Esc-Shift-Right (bound to select-forward-sexp).
 
 This new 299 function looks very convenient:
 
 Add User-defined Keybindings menu item in "Edit"
 
 Help-desk wasn't pretty forbidding for a MrEd novice like me:
 
 "The keybindings language is DrScheme's graphical language, i.e., it
 contains (lib "mred.ss" "mred") and (lib "class.ss")..."
 
 Could you include an example?  How about just making a file mykeys.ss
 for me :)  Here's the patches that I install every new version
 (actually by hand since I don't trust myself).

    > But doesn't Emacs behave in my non-modern-X way?
 
    Yes.
 
 Thanks, Matthew.  Sounds like a serious change then.  Can you explain
 the advantage of this non-Emacs behavior?  Obviously, 2 locations to
 store in & paste from is good.  But how do we usefully manipulate
 these 2 locations X select and X clipboard?  I could see saying: the
 mouse uses X clipboard, but typing (C-x, C-v etc) uses X select.  But
 it seems disorganized that an Esc-Shift-Right selection needs a
 middle-mouse to paste.  Is there a pattern I'm missing? 
 
    > But it didn't work for me.  My file ~/.plt-prefs.ss now reads

 Thanks, it works now.  My file reads
 
 (
  (|MrEd:selectionAsClipboard| #t)
 ...)
 and C-v or Sh-Insert will paste what Esc-Shift-Right selects.   
 
 But I think there's a bug in the documentation.  Even in 299.200, Help
  Desk takes me right to 3.4.3, Preference Files
 
 * Under Unix, preferences are stored in .plt-prefs.ss in the user's home directory.
 
 in the PLT DrScheme: Programming Environment Manual.

 Thanks.  And I can try to figure it out myself too :)
