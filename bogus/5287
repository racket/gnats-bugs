>Description:
 Since things speed up when I move the mouse-cursor around;
 what is gating execution, waiting for events?
 
 In particular, things are particularly slow when running the test suites
 from DrScheme, where once the programmatically generated test text input
 ran at reasonably fast, now it enters characters at the rate of ~2 per
 second, unless I wiggle the mouse, and it speeds up by ~10x.
