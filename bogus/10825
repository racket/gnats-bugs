This (incorrect) program executes without error in the defintions window.

#lang scheme/load

(module m scheme
  (define-syntax-rule (#%module-begin . e)
    (begin 'not-allowed-here (#%plain-module-begin . e)))
  (provide (all-defined-out) (all-from-out scheme)))

(module n 'm 3 4 5)

(require 'n)

But if I do this:

(eval (expand #'(module n 'm 3 4 5)))

I get the (expected) error: 
#%plain-module-begin: illegal use (not a module body) in: (#%plain-module-begin (quote 3) (quote 4) (quote 5))

I think the behavior with the module declaration form is a bug.

 Can you put the number of what it's a duplicate of in the closing messages?
