 >>> I've been using MzScheme 202 on my PowerMac G4, which runs MacOS 
 >>> 10.2.  I recently tried to install the latest MzScheme, v203, but 
 >>> the installer complains falsely that the old PLT libraries are 
 >>> actually newer, and then refuses to go any further in the 
 >>> installation. [...]
 >
 >> This is a known problem, and there's an unpleasant workaround.  The 
 >> reason that the MacOS 'knows' that the other version is there is 
 >> because of a file or files in /Library/Receipts.

 > Ah ha, I missed those.

 >>   You need to remove one of the PLT-related ones.  Actually, if you

 > A little detective work, just a little, is what I've now done.  I note 
 > for the following discussion that MzScheme v202 puts two packages in 
 > the Receipts directory: one called "MzScheme Framework.pkg" and 
 > another called simply "MzScheme.pkg".  Version 203 seems to install 
 > only the former.
 >
 > Starting with MzScheme 202 already on my system, the deletion of 
 > "MzScheme Framework.pkg" permitted the installation of MzScheme 203 to 
 > run successfully.
 >
 > I then purged v203 from my system (deleting the software and all 
 > receipts), reinstalled v202, and then removed the "MzScheme.pkg" 
 > receipt only.  In this circumstance, installing v203 was unsuccessful 
 > as before: there was a spurious complaint that newer libraries were 
 > already present.
 >
 > Conclusion: it's "MzScheme Framework.pkg" that's the troublemaker.

 > I'm afraid it /was/ a problem on my system, for whatever reason.  That

 > tried earlier, before your email arrived, and before the "detective

 >
 > Moreover, I'm afraid I'm too lazy now to experiment with installing 
 > DrScheme in the presence and absence of the two MzScheme receipts.  At 
 > the moment I'm happy to have my MzScheme back, updated and working.
