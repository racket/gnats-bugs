>Description:
As members of the Israeli team that develops learning materials for high school student, we want to fit our curriculum to your latest version (Version 102). But we have two problems with this version:
a. It does not recognize the Boolean ATOM? Does this version has another Boolean instead of atom?
b. When it has to return list, it returns the word LIST and then the listâ€™s components. Can you change it to return the list component in parenthesis without the word LIST (like it was in version 53)?

Thank, Tamar Paz
