 That would be better closed with a WONTFIX.
 
 (As for "yourmomwasgreat" -- coming from someone who also says that
 "books r gay", it certainly looks like studying is a waste of time for
 you.)

 Your problem may be because you aren't using the latest version of
 DrScheme.  If you upgrade, you might even learn to spell English
 correctly!  Therefore, I strongly suggest you consider trying version
 4.2.4 instead.
