>Description:
I set a property in meta/props and then moved the file. When I went to delete the property, this is what I get:

C:\Users\robby\git\plt>Racket.exe -tm collects\meta\props get drdr:command-line collects\tests\drracket\collapsed.rkt
Racket.exe: path does not exist: "collects\\tests\\drracket\\collapsed.rkt"

I think that this test shouldn't happen (at least in the case that the prop is in there)

To show that the prop is in there.

robby@GAOPING-WIN7 ~/git/plt (master)
$ grep collapsed.rkt collects/meta/props
"collects/tests/drracket/collapsed.rkt" drdr:command-line (racket "-l" "racket/g
ui/base" "-t" *)
