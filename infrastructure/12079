>Description:
On the front page of the Racket website, there's a code sample, as follows:

#lang racket

(for ((path (in-directory)))
  (when (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" path)
    (printf "source file: ~a\n" path)))

When run on OS X, I get the following error:

directory-list: could not open "/.Spotlight-V100" (Permission denied; errno=13)
. . car: expects argument of type <pair>; given #<void>


It may be reasonable to throw an error, but it would be dispiriting for people very new to Racket to find that the first sample of code being pushed at them from the official website doesn't do anything other than throw an error.
