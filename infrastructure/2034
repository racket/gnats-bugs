Linux
>Description:
Your latest release, DrScheme 103p1, does not provide the Dorai Sitaram
document "Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days".  This was included in
previous releases.  I was wondering if this omission is on purpose?

Regards,
Jeff Stephens

Following download and installation click on Help->Help Desk.  Under

 I'm not sure that Teach Yourself Scheme made it into version 103. Did 
 you see it there? It is in our CVS releases, but only a few changes 
 made it into the p1 release. (In retrospect I probably should have 
 added it as well, but that's neither here nor there...)

 Actually, that isn't the previous version, but the *next* version.
 
 103p1 is just a small (albeit important) patch to 103. The version in 
 CVS is 199.
 
 Hope that clears things up!
