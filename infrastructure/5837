 Apparently, ATM.DLL is a file installed by Adobe Type Manager.  The
 error you saw looks to be a bug in that program.
 
 Here's an article from Microsoft on how to uninstall Adobe Type Manager:
 
  <http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q69692>
 
 Let me know if uninstalling the Adobe program allows you to use
 DrScheme.
