 Try looking at 
 
   http://www.wise.com/displayArticle.asp?articleno=1034
 
 and see if any of those apply to you.
 
 If the file is actually corrupt, it could be that your browser has
 cached the file, so that you're always getting the same bad file.  You
 might flushing your download cache and re-downloading.
