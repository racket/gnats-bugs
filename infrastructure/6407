I'm getting a checksum error when doing a tar -xvlf of 
plt-205.sparc-solaris.tar. Also, the extracted plt directory is missing 
plt/install.

P.S. I tried checking out the cvs instead, but for some reason my network 
can't find your cvs server. I expect this problem is on my side of things.

 Do you have gnutar? Can you try that? (we're still looking into the 
 problem, but that will probably work for now)

 Oh! You don't already have it? Sorry.
 
 Anyways, we should hopefully figure out how to get some solaris tar 
 friendly bundles on the web page, hopefully soon.

 Hi Eric --
 
 We just found out about this problem.  Turns out there's a problem
 with /bin/tar but not with GNU tar.  So if you have access to the
 latter, that will help you complete the installation; meanwhile, we'll
 try to put out a distribution bundle that isn't thus affected.
 
 Btw, I expect I'll be at the talk you're giving at NEU next month (at
 least, I plan to be and have set aside the day).  See you there.
 
 Shriram

 Looks like the binaries that were built in the bundle you got were 
 built with libGl linked in and you don't have it, or don't have the 
 same versison.
 
 I would just install the src version; it takes a little longer, but is 
 easy to do.
