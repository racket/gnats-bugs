>Description:
It would be nice if the open command worked with DrScheme. That is, this command (run in a terminal window):

open -e /home/robby/cvs/exp/plt/DrScheme.app ~/cvs/plt/collects/drscheme/drscheme.ss

should open the file drscheme.ss in drscheme. Instead, it opens the file in Text Edit.

Also, it would be great if this:

  open -e DrScheme ...

or even

  open -e drscheme ...

or even

  open filename.scm
  open filename.ss

opened the file in drscheme (preferably the currently open drscheme).

I'm not sure about this one, but if this:

  open -e DrScheme .

could conceiveably bring drscheme to the front, choose the file|open menu item (or some equivalent thereof) and put the dialog in the current directory, that would be great too. This one is much less important, tho.

 It works for me.
 
 Do ".ss" and ".scm" files have the PLT logo for you by default?

 The particular file I tried does and I think that they do have that 
 logo by default in general. How did you specify the -e argument?

 I just tried `open <some file>'.
 
 Looks to me like "-e" means "open with Text Edit".
