>Description:
Could you please post the "last updated" date on everypage of the DrScheme web site. Providing the release date for the binary files would be a good thing, too. Last time I checked, DrScheme was at version 100. Now it is at version 203. When was version 203 released? To find out, the user has to read the history file. I think this information should also be provided on the download page.

 What URL are you looking at?
 
 The latest version is 200, with 201 to follow soon.
 
 The download server (http://download.plt-scheme.org/) indicates clearly
 what the latest version is, and the individual pages for downloads, such
 as http://download.plt-scheme.org/drscheme/, also indicates the latest
 version.
 
 Since DrScheme v200, a built-in version checker lets you check whether
 there's a newer version that been released, directly in DrScheme.

 What is the URL where you see "203"?  There is no such version.

 OK, we'll consider adding this.

 You might consider adding that to the contributed software page at 
 
   http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/develop/
 
 once it's done.

 It looks like you're interested in the release dates for PLT packages,
 rather than the dates of Web pages.
 
 So I've added a "PLT Release Chronology" link on the download pages for
 each package.  I hope this is enough.
