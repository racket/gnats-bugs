 I haven't heard of this problem before -- and we have successfully
 installed v202 on a Win95 box.
 
 One possibility is that the installer executable is corrupt somehow.
 Can you delete the .exe, re-download it, and try again?  Probably that's
 not what you want to hear, but that's my only current suggestion.
