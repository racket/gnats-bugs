 Using a build that is not released means that it tries to get the
 missing files from the nightly builds.  But the nightly builds no
 longer include the same manuals since the documentation system was
 heavily revised.  (Even when we do get manuals like r5rs into the new
 format, the files are unlikely to be in the same structure.)
 
 The best you can do is just get the .plt files yourself from the 372
 distribution.  (Since it's replaced, none of these manuals is going to
 change.)

 They are -- in the usual place, which is not where "refresh manuals"
 is looking.
 
 The "refresh manuals" is a feature that is used only for development
 builds, which uses the nightly builds.  That's gone, and you can get
 all manuals by getting them from the standard place that 372 is found
 -- and there is no need to do refreshing later, since nothing changes.
 
 (And please keep "bugs@plt-scheme.org" if you reply, thanks.)

 thanks (now I understand that nothing is necessary beyond updating via svn).
