>Description:
After starting DrScheme, version 372, English on
Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, when I go to
Help -> Check for Updates..., the following error
dialog box pops up:

----- error message follows immediately after this
line -----
PLT Version Check

Error: could not connect to website
(tcp-read: error reading (Unknown error; errno=10054))
----- error message ends immediately before this line
-----

Also, when I attempt to try out tetris.ss on PLaneT
with (require (planet "tetris.ss" ("dvanhorn"
"tetris.plt" 1 0))), the following error message
appears:

----- error message follows immediately after this
line -----
require: PLaneT could not find the requested package:
Server had no matching package: Your version of PLT
Scheme is too old to run the specified package in:
(planet "tetris.ss" ("dvanhorn" "tetris.plt" 1 0))
----- error message ends immediately before this line
-----

These bugs started appearing after I noticed that
DrScheme was running extremely slow one day, and then
tried reinstalling DrScheme.  I noticed that DrScheme
was not listed in the "Add/Delete Programs" program in
the Windows Control Panel.

I then reinstalled DrScheme, and the speed returned,
but then I could not update DrScheme from the menu.

I just tried reinstalling DrScheme.  This time,
DrScheme appeared correctly in the "Add/Delete
Programs" program in the Windows Control Panel, and it
seemed that I was able to uninstall and reinstall
DrScheme, version 372, English, correctly; however,
DrScheme still does not seem able to update itself or
to fetch tetris.ss from PLaneT.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Start DrScheme.

2. Go to Help -> Check for Updates....

The following error dialog box pops up:

----- error message follows immediately after this

 This was answered on the mailing list.

 This is definitely not a PLT problem.  The only code that ever touches
 the registry entries that are responsible for showing PLT in the
 add/delete programs is the installer and uninstaller.  If it vanished
 without running either one then it did not happen because of drscheme.

 This sounds like it's a problem somewhere in your enviornment.

 When I evaluate the above statements in DrScheme,
 version 3.99.0.13-svn26feb2008, english (as you've
 probably already seen from the mailing list, I've
 since updated), the following error message appears:
 
 --
 read-line: name is not defined, not a parameter, and
 not a primitive name in: read-line
 --
 
 Any ideas on what this error message implies?

 `read-line' is a built-in function.  Perhaps you were in one of the
 teaching languages by mistake?

 Oh, sorry; my mistake.
 
 I just switched the language from "Teaching Languages
 -> How to Design Programs -> Advanced Student" to
 "Legacy Languages -> PLT -> Pretty Big (includes MrEd
 and Advanced Student)," and reevaluated the statements
 
   (require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
   (read-line (get-pure-port (string->url
  "http://download.plt-scheme.org/version")))
 
 with the following returned result:
 
   "((recent \"372\") (stable \"372\"))"
 
 (the double-quotes were all included in the output).
 
 Any ideas?

 It means that your machine connects fine to the server to get the
 current version.  Perhaps your original problem was due to a temporary
 network failure?

 Actually, the original problem still exists; when I
 just ran Help -> Check for Updates..., I still got the
 following error message (in Legacy Langauges -> PLT ->
 Pretty Big (includes MrEd and Advanced Student) mode):
 
 ----- error message follows immediately after this
 line -----
 PLT Version Check
 
 Error: could not connect to website
 (tcp-read: error reading (Unknown error; errno=10054))
 ----- error message ends immediately before this line
 
 However, when I just ran (in the same mode) the
 following code
 
   (require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
   (read-line (get-pure-port (string->url
  "http://download.plt-scheme.org/version")))
 
 I still got the following returned result:
 
   "((recent \"372\") (stable \"372\"))"
 
 (the double-quotes were all included in the output).
 
 So perhaps the machine connects fine to the server to
 get the current version, but the menu option somehow
 isn't working, or perhaps the code and menu functions
 use different ports, and only one of them is blocked
 by a corporate firewall?
 
 Thanks for your continuing help.  Any other
 possibilities?

 Do you use a proxy?
 
 Try this now:
 
   (require version/check)
   (check-version)
 
 If it's working, you will see
 
   (error "the download pages were not ported to v4 yet")

 Here is the result:
 
   (error "could not connect to website" "(tcp-read:
 error reading (Unknown error; errno=10054))")
 
 Does this mean that my company uses a proxy?  I'm not
 sure about whether this company uses a proxy; I'd need
 to ask the IT Department.  Should I ask them?
