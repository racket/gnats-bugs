>Description:
It would nice to have a way to exclude particular files from 
particular bundles, even though they're in a collection
otherwise included in that bundle.

For instance, we need to exclude some files in the web-server
collection from the Mz bundles, though we want most of
the collection there.

The file web-server.in contains "plt/collects/web-server",
and makeex says the "mz" bundle contains "web-server", which
gives all of that collection.

If we had a file "mz.out" that listed the excluded
files, that would do what's needed.

Or maybe this mechanism already exists?

>How-To-Repeat:
Try building a MzScheme bundle!
