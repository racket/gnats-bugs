>Description:
I am running RedHat 8.0. plt-202-1.i386.rpm does not install under 8.0, so I grabbed the compressed source archive and tried to install it. The "install" shell script gives an error message and stops prematurely because it expects  to see mzscheme in the bin subdirectory of the unzipped/untarred archives, and mzscheme is not there.  The src subdirectory does have the usual configure file, and I was able to successfully make mzscheme there, but that doesn't affect the install script, as it looks specifically in the bin directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
- grab plt-202-1.i386.rpm
- tar xzf plt-202-1.i386.rpm in the location of your choice
- cd plt
- ./install

You will get the messages

./install: line 15: [path]/plt/bin/mzscheme: No suh file or directory
./install: line 15: exec: [path]/plt/bin/mzscheme: cannot execute: No such file or directory

 Either
   cd plt/src
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   cd ..
   ./install
 or read plt/src/README for more details.
 
 Perhaps the install script's error message could refer the user to
 the plt/src/README file.

 Thanks; it's now up and running.  If it's convenient to have README 
 files at the top level specific to the executable and source 
 distributions, that would be one way to prevent people from replicating 
 my mistake.
