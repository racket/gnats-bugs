 At the end of the installation process, there should have been a MrEd
 window openning up with some text.  If there was an error in this
 step, this should have stopped with a red line indicating the error.
 Can you check if this is what happened to you and if so specify the
 message?

 After this you should have a PLT directory (usually in C:\Program Files),
 can you see if the same thing happens when you double click "Finish
 Install" in that directory?  What about running "MrEd" in there --
 does this cause any crashes?

 Thanks for keeping me updated, in case this will happen again.
