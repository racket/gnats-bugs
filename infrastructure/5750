>Description:
After Dr. Scheme finishes installing, trying to run the program fails.
The Dr. Scheme executable is nowhere to be found on the hard drive. The other executables (Mz. Scheme and Mr. Ed) are there.

Is the installer packaged wrong? I tried downloading it twice, once from each location in the USA, and neither worked.

According to what I read, DrScheme.exe simply invokes MrEd.exe with a specific set of command line parameters. If I knew these parameters, I could make my own shortcut and not worry about DrScheme.exe.

Thank you!

>How-To-Repeat:
1) Download the Windows 95 version of Dr. Scheme.

2) Install it.

3) The installer will complete normally.

4) Locate "DrScheme" in the Start->Programs->PLT Scheme menu.

5) Attempt to execute it. On my system, the link is broken because the executable file doesn't exist.

 Some questions:
 
   1) Did you have an old version of DrScheme on your system?  Did you
 uninstall it?
 
   2) During installation, did you choose to make .zo's, or not?

 Try the following.
 
  - startup MzScheme
  - enter the program
 
      (require (lib "setup.ss" "setup"))
         
  - when that finishes after a few minutes, see if the 
     PLT Scheme|DrScheme shortcut in the Programs menu
     works
