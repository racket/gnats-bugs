>Description:
Fresh SVN checkout and install (revision 7095).

After building successfully, started DrScheme, opened help desk, clicked on "Manuals", then "refresh all manuals."  Download fails -- the Installer Progress window logs several downloads and finishes with the following:

Downloading Teachpacks for How to Design Classes...
Downloading ProfessorJ Beginner Language...
Downloading ProfessorJ Intermediate Language...
Downloading ProfessorJ Intermediate + access Language...
error response from server "404 Not Found"
Finished.

This is reproducible -- I tried three times and got the 404 at the same point in the process.
