 I tried to install 103p1 from the Rice server.  It complained about not
 finding "shell.dll" and some others I can't recall right now.  I will
 repeat my installation steps and mail you again tonight.

 Which version did you try to install: 103p1 (from the Rice server), or
 200alpha1 (from the Northeastern server)?
 
 I've successfully installed both of those versions on XP Professional,
 no problems at all.
 
 Which .DLL's were reported missing?

 Hi Paul,
 
 Just to make sure I understand: This is a problem with the *installer*,
 not DrScheme itself, right?

 Tom,
 
 	Matthias says he told you that others have had trouble with XP.
 I believe that problem was not XP-specific, in fact.  Those folks were
 able to successfully install DrScheme; the trouble came during
 execution.
 
 I think SHELL.DLL should be in SystemRoot/System (WINDOWS/System on XP,
 I think).  Do you have that file?

 I will check into this when I get home tonight. I'm not running XP-home
 at the office.

 It is an install-time problem.
 
 However, I've had no troubles with 103p1 or 200alpha1 on XP.  So I'm
 guessing it's an XP configuration problem.
