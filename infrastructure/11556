I filed a bug report recently that included a program that included the lambda character. For reference, that character looks like this: Î».

GnatsWeb apparently gives browsers the header "Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1", causing browsers to interpret the text as Latin-1. Manually setting the character set to UTF-8 in the browser fixes the problem.

GnatsWeb should therefore join the 21st century by telling browsers that charset=utf-8.
