>Description:
We need to say something about the files in 
PLT that the uninstall script leaves behind. 
Should users worry about mred.pref mred.ini 
etc? Is it okay to install N+1 over N's reminders?

 Well, the 103 uninstaller basically leaves *nothing* behind in 
 the PLT directory, except for user-created immediate 
 subdirectories and non-.EXE files in the PLT directory.
 So that means that users will be able to install future 
 versions after uninstalling 103.
 
 Users don't have to worry about mred.pre and mred.ini,
 since those are not deleted whether they are in 
 the users' home directories or the PLT directory.
 
 Installing 103 over an earlier version may require manually
 deleting software not installed as part of the main 
 distribution, such as MrSpidey.  I'll make this clearer in 
 the Windows download instructions.
