>Description:
I am finally getting back to trying to install PLT again.

Trying to install 200alpha12 onWindows XP Home edition. Upon double-clicking on the plt installer, get the following series of messages:

1. Cannot find COMMDLG.DLL.
2. Cannot find SHELL.DLL.
3. System DLLs corrupt or missing. The End.

I find and COMMDLG.DLL and SHELL.DLL in c:\WINNT\system

My PC is operating just fine with no other problems, so I assume
that the problem is on your end. Have you tested on the Home edition?

 This is puzzling -- I've had no problems under XP Pro.
 
 We're using the Wise installer, and it's given us no -- well, almost no
 -- trouble under 95/98/Me/NT/2000.
 
 I know one person has definitely run alpha1 under XP Home, but I'm not
 sure whether he installed it via Wise, or used CVS.  I've just sent him
 a message to see.

 I will mail you a copy of XP Home Edition - I've got an extra one at
 home. Please send me a post address.

 I did a clean install of XP Home on my Sony VAIO laptop.
 
 I installed DrScheme v200alpha12 from the Web site
 
   http://download.plt-scheme.org/
 
 The installation went without a hitch.  DrScheme is running fine.
 
 I did a Search on those two .DLL's.  On my system, they are not only in
 WINDOWS\system, but also in WINDOWS\system32.  Could that be the
 problem?

 Interesting... I'll see what happens if I copy them over. Thanks.
