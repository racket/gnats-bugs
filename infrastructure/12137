>Description:
When I went into racket-lang.org and grabbed the installer (.sh) file for Debian Squeeze (http://download.racket-lang.org/racket-5-1-3-bin-x86_64-linux-debian-squeeze-sh.html), I did "chmod u+x racket5-1.3...." to be able to execute it, and I did. I chose 1 for the default installation directory and chose to "possible override existing binaries" in the second option. The installation went through just fine, but when I tried to "drracket" or "racket", I got "/usr/racket/bin/gracket: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected".

 Are you sure that you're running `racket' from the correct place?  The
 executable file is a binary, so a syntax error about "(" sounds like
 some shell script that went wrong somewhere.
