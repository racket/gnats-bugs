>Description:
When I try to install any .plt's I get:
---
setup-plt: Setup version is 201
setup-plt: PLT home directory is /usr/local/plt
setup-plt: Collection Paths are: (/usr/local/plt/collects)
cannot install; archive is for an older version of PLT Scheme
----

I've tried this with readline.plt and SirMail.plt, downloaded from the Add-Ons web page.  
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Download readline.plt to /tmp/readline.plt 
2. Run "setup-plt /tmp/readline.plt"
3. Get error.

 Looks like I spoke too quickly. There does seem to be something wrong.
 
 One workaround I can offer is to use the CVS version. Both SirMail and
 readline are in the CVS archives directly and they both work there (see
 the X-Mailer: line in this email).

 Hi Jeff,
 
 Looks like you found both of the bad archives. They were created for
 v200, but long before v200 was finalized and released.
 
 I've replaced the .plt archives with versions that work.
 
 I expect that you tried installing SirMail just to test .plt files. But
 if you really want to use it, the CVS-based version is much better.
 (We've been working on SirMail recently, and the changes rely on new
 features in 202.X.)
 
 Matthew
