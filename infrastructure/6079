 You need to build the binaries first.
 
 Go into plt/src, and run
 
   ./configure
   make 
   make install

 It sounds like you are just running
   plt/src/install
 That script only installs the software once it is built.
 Try
   cd plt/src
   make
   make install
   ./install
 instead.
 
 Read
   plt/src/README
 if that doesn't help.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul
