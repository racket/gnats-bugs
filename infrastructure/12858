[Sending as a PR in case it's harder than a one-line.]

It would be very nice if the "build in progress" line in drdr was
linked to a logfile showing the build & test progress.  This way people
could monitor it more closely, and find problems before it finishes.
It can also be useful to have earlier reporting of problems in case
it gets stuck.

This might be an easy patch, but maybe the logs are not too readable
to be useful, which is why it might need much more work than what I
imagine...
