>Description:
I receive bug notifications from this bug system when someone submits a report, but these emails do not have bugs@racket-lang.org in the reply-to field. This means that responses to this email do not get put on the audit trail.

In particular I noticed this with my responses regarding pr/13598.

 They have the correct header for that, for example, in this email
 there is:
 
   Reply-To: eric.n.dobson@gmail.com, bugs@racket-lang.org

 I agree that the header is that (now actually looking at the header).
 The problem is though that Gmail doesn't include bugs@racket-lang.org
 in my reply all when my email is the from address, this may be a bug
 in Gmail though.

 I see this thread:
 
   http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/6ZYreSjOyX0
 
 where this is mentioned as some kind of a gmail feature, but no
 explanation for it though.  You're obviously in a better position to
 find that out...

 FWIW, when I reply-all in gmail, I get the right addresses in the headers.
