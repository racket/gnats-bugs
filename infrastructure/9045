>Description:
When trying to open a file using "open" in OS X Leopard:

  open -a /opt/local/plt/DrScheme.app ~/my-file.scm

I get the following error message:

  LSOpenFromURLSpec() failed with error -10827 for the file /Users/dave/my-file.scm

Apparently this error message comes from OS X's Launch Services. Here's the rather unhelpful description of the error message:

  kLSNoExecutableErr  
  -10827
  The executable file is missing or has an unusable format.

(from http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Reference/LaunchServicesReference/Reference/reference.html)

I can open files directly from DrScheme's File menu, but I can't open them by double-clicking them in OS X or using "open" on the command line.

This worked fine under Tiger. I can only assume it's a Leopard specific thing.

 Hi all,
 
 I managed to fix this problem by resetting my Launch Services database:
 
      # Reset the database:
      /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/ 
 LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local - 
 domain system -domain user
 
      #Run DrScheme to re-register it:
      open /usr/local/pltv4/DrScheme.app
 
 On a separate note, you guys should consider using DrScheme's  
 Info.plist to register *.scm and *.ss as plain text files in OS X's  
 Quick Look. I think it can all be done from the Info.plist file. If I  
 get it working I'll send the code to the plt-scheme list.
 
 Cheers,
 
 -- Dave

 Oops - I forgot I'd submitted this bug report. I worked out how to fix  
 the problem, although I don't know if there's anything that can be  
 done to prevent it happening in the first place.
 
 I run PLT out of SVN, and when I want to update I just "svn up" and  
 recompile everything. The problem comes about when I recompile  
 DrScheme: LaunchServices doesn't like it. Resetting the LaunchServices  
 database sorts the problem out. It's a bit of a pain but it works.
 
 Hope this helps,

 (Like I said, I'm leaving this to Matthew, since I don't have any
 experience with OSX.  But it looks like Noel had some suggestion about
 this, so if you have some patch, I'm sure it will help...)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 19:43:13 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later;
either the bug is long-since fixed, the relevant code
doesn't exist anymore, the relevant platform hasn't been
supported recently, or a new bug report is needed if the
problem really isn't fixed and someone actually cares
