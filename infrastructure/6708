 Why did you download it twice?  Did ythe download get interrupted?
 Also, please try the most recent version, it is now 206p1.

 What do you mean by "prior to installing DrScheme"?  At what stage
 exactly did it crash, what program crashed, and what was the error
 message?

 BTW, how much memory do you have?

 I downloaded twice because the copy I made at work was moved to a CD-ROM, 
 which is what I used the first time.  Thinking that it might have been a bad 
 download, I redownloaded at home.
 
 BTW, both were the lastest version 206.1

 Here's the rest of the answer.
 
 It runs until it starts the PLT Installer, and here is the error message:
 
 PLT Installer:  MrEd.exe - Application Error
 
 "The instruction at 0x100c420e referenced memory at 0x00000014.  The memory 
 could not be read."
 
 When I click OK, the installer brings up the "Run DrScheme" option, but then 
 exits.
 
 When I look at the startup directory, the entries for DrScheme and HelpDesk 
 are there, but the icons are generic Windows icons, indicating that the .exe's 
 aren't there.  When I check the directory, there is no executable for DrScheme.
 
 As to the computer, it is an AMD 1700, with 256meg of ram, operating with a 
 386 meg swap file.

Responsible-Changed-When: Mon Feb 16 02:30:13 2004
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    This seems to be caused by a MrEd.exe crash.
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Wed, 02 Jun 2004 13:30:32 -0400
Reason>>> This problem is fixed in the current v207 installer.
(The problem was still there in the initial v207 installer.)
