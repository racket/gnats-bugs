>Description:
When you submit a bug report, you get the following text:

-----
Your PLT bug report has been submitted.

To check on submitted reports, visit the bug report query page.

You should receive an email confirming your report in 30 minutes or less. The confirmation will be sent to

sk@cs.brown.edu

If you do not receive such confirmation, please report the problem to scheme@plt-scheme.org or to the PLT mailing list.
-----

where "PLT mailing list" is a pointer to 

http://www.plt-scheme.org/maillist/

I suggest replacing the awkward "PLT bug report" with "Racket bug report", etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Submit a bug report.
Read carefully.

 Is this coming from the bug report server or is it in the distro somewhere?

 The server only.  (One script, to be more exact, and I'm just about
 done with it.)
