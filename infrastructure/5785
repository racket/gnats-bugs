>Description:
I tried to install the latest version of DrScheme (being a complete Scheme neophyte, and wanting to learn more about it with the Abelson/Sussman book), but something appears ... not right.

The install completes with no errors, yet when done, I have no DrScheme.exe file.

The download looks like:

  -rwxrwxrwx   1 Mike Campbell root  4762747 Sep  3 21:08 plt-202.exe


After I run, the install dir looks like:

(Note no DrScheme.exe)

The install.log file shows that no .exe has been installed.  I'm stymied.

 The DrScheme.exe file is built during the installation, so it 
 doesn't show up in the install log.
 
 Try uninstalling, and reinstalling (a pain, I know).  That worked 
 for another user who had this problem.

 Hmmm, no idea what went wrong.
 
 I've installed v202 on Win98, Win2K, and WinXP with no problems.
 But Windows installations are often temperamental ...
 
 Glad it's working now.
