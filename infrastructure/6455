>Description:
Yesterday I tried installing DrScheme 205
on a friend's computer (win98). I tried using 
the Northeastern and Utah servers, but there
was errors during the installation.
(In one case it stopped at the middle with
an "General Exception"-message from windows,
in another the plt-installer suggested that
the installation file was corrupt).

Then I downloaded it again (from NorthEastern)
at his laptop (winXP) and got a similar error. 
My friend the suggested using the version from 
Institut Pasteur and that worked.
(and so did version 204 from NorthEastern)

My guess is therefore, that something has happened
to the 205-binaries at North Eastern and Utah. 

Of course there is always the possibility that there
was some kind of error on my friend's internet
connection, but it seemed okay.

 Something does look strange.  Can you send me the md5sums of the bad
 and the good files?
