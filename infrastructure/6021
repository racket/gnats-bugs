I just started installing DrScheme on Windows XP. 
For the last 10-15 minutes
the system has been hanging at the small window that says "Please
wait: Connecting to PLT version server". How long should I wait?

 No more than a few (say, 20) seconds.  Did you try hitting the "Cancel"
 button?
 
 Is this with v202?

 Yes, I tried hitting the cancel button. Didn't work. I had to reboot the
 machine to get out of this.
 
 Yes, the version was v202.

 That's frightening.
 
 When you install, you can choose not to have it run the version checker.
 There's a check field in a dialog box near the beginning of the
 installation wizard.  You may have to manually delete the files (usually
 in C:\Program Files\PLT) to re-install.
 
 I'm assuming your machine has a network connection.  Does your network
 funnel HTTP requests to a proxy?  Anything else remarkable about your
 network?

 I have a firewall installed (ZoneAlarm). Perhaps I should add the site URL
 to the "zones" as a trusted site.

 Yes, let me know if that helps.  The checker connects to
 download.plt-scheme.org.
 
 I'm surprised that the TCP/IP code didn't timeout and raise an
 exception.  I'll look into it ...

 If you have DrScheme running now, what happens when executing the
 following code:
  
   (require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
   (get-pure-port (string->url "http://download.plt-scheme.org"))
 
 Does the firewall setting make any difference?

 On 
   (require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
 
 I get "reference to undefined identifier: require"

 Oh, you must be running an old version of DrScheme, probably 103.
 
 Under 103, this code should work:
 
   (require-library "url.ss" "net")
   
 then the rest as before.

 No, this is the first time I am using DrScheme. Perhaps the language level
 is the problem.
 
 More and more confused,
 Dran
 
 P.S. Something did install, in spite of the problem I had. I have some
      version of DrScheme on my machine :-)

 Ah, OK.
 
 Use the "PLT - Graphical" language level, and try the original code I
 sent.

 Okay. Now the firewall is querying me
 
   "Do you want to allow mred to access the local network?"

 I forgot to ask:  do you see an exception or some other response in
 DrScheme when this happens?

State-Changed-Why:
    I'm going to close the bug report, since you managed to 
    install DrScheme.
    
    Unfortunately, I don't have a firewall like the one you
    mention to test the behavior of the version checker.
    I do know that if you have *no* network connection, the
    checker aborts properly.
