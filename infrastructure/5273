 The help-desk, available from the help menu of DrScheme, provides a "manuals"
 link.  One of the manuals is "PLT MrEd: Graphical Toolbox Manual," which
 contains all the information you need.
 
 If you really want a hard copy (which I personally would not want) then
 you can download a pdf version from
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/pdf/mred.pdf
 for version 103 or from
  http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/200alpha12/pdf/mred.pdf
 for version 200.
