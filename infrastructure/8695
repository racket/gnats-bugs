>Description:
The download for DrScheme 370 for OS X PPC, from the Northeastern mirror, appears to be corrupt.  The specific dmg file is "plt-370-bin-ppc-osx-mac.dmg".  It failed to mount on OS X 10.4.8.  I tried it twice and both times the md5 was 994d78d6457c55acce59ba69f3a33987.  I downloaded from the *Chicago* mirror, got a file with a different md5 (6493bc268491e68723376ea22e34582e), which mounts fine.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Download plt-370-bin-ppc-osx-mac.dmg from the Northeastern mirror.  Try to open it.

Reason>>> Everything looks fine now.  I'm not sure how it could have
been wrong, but I don't see any problem now.  (I think that
I did see the problem for a brief time, but cannot recreate
it now through either ftp of http.)
