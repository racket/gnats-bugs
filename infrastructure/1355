>Description:
First, it took me a week to correctly download and install the latest release of Scheme. Then I found out our professor developed his routines use version 53 and they do not work with 101.  I had to uninstall 101.  I clicked on 'uninstall'.  It appeared to do its thing.  Then I went to the web site to download release 53.  When it asked where to save it on disk, I was shocked to see that version 101 was still there.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install scheme 101.
Click Uninstall.
Look at explorer.
See the folder and exec.

        I had to uninstall 101.  I clicked on 'uninstall'.

 What files remained in the 101 installation directory?  
 
 The uninstaller only removes files that were installed 
 during the original installation, plus compiled Scheme files 
 (.zo files).  If you created other files, the uninstaller 
 leaves them on the theory that you might want to keep them.
 Also, if you downloaded other PLT software not in the original
 installation, such as MrSpidey or MysterX, the uninstaller 
 isn't aware of it.  That may change in the future.
 
 Thanks for the feedback.

 Do you recall the names of any of those files?
 Also, how did you invoke the uninstaller -- 
 from the command line, or from a Start menu
 choice?

 OK, the best way to uninstall DrScheme (or any 
 Windows program) is to use Add/Remove Programs
 in Control Panel.  Using the menu option for
 Uninstall in the Start|Programs|PLT is also OK.
 
 I tried an uninstall yesterday with 101, and 
 everything disappeared.  So I'm not quite sure
 what went wrong with your installation.
