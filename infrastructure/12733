>Description:
Hi,

I'm trying to reply to a ticket:
http://planet.plt-scheme.org/trac/ticket/417

But I get the error (I am logged with 'orseau'):
Warning: Recaptcha failed: incorrect-captcha-sol 

But I don't see any captcha of this page (and Adblock is disabled).

Also, I have an error at the bottom of the page:
Input error: Invalid referer 

Same for another ticket.

How can I solve that?

Thanks,
Laurent

 Found the problem.
 I've got old bookmarks that still link to planet.plt-scheme.org, where the
 captcha don't appear (and maybe other things may break there too).
 Obviously I'll update my bookmarks, but maybe it would be good to add an
 automatic redirection from plt-scheme.org to racket-lang.org?

 Thanks for figuring this out!
 
 From what I can tell by puzzling over the apache config files, this
 needs be fixed by editing /etc/httpd/conf/plt.conf  on winooski to add
 a redirection (unlike the plt websever redirections I cannot add a
 redirection myself since the config files do not defer to something I
 can edit).
 
 I'd suggest a line to add there, but I'm actually not quite sure how
 these work (so I may be completely wrong about how to fix this).

 I think that that's possible, but the wrong place to add redirections.
 It's better to do that in ~wwwplanet/webroot/htdocs/.htaccess which is
 a file that you control, and where all the planet rewrites are
 implemented.
 
 (This could be wrong though, if the rewrites can't distinguish URLs
 based on the hostname used, but I think that they can.)

 Regardless of the above, I should look into doing these rewrites,
 since I have more experience with them.  (Looking at that file, I
 think that I'm the one who wrote all of them.)
 
 But I'll need an *exact* specification of the URLs that should be
 redirected, to avoid redirecting old URLs that planet uses to download
 packages.  (Obviously, you can also specify the exact specification of
 URLs that should *not* be redirected...)
 
 Once you do that, I'll play with the rules and make the redirections.

 Don't the /trac urls bypass this file? I don't know why I thought that
 anymore, but that's what I was thinking at the time.

 Here's what would have helped here: anything begins with this:
 
   http://www.plt-scheme.org/trac
 
 should change to have this prefix:
 
   http://www.racket-lang.org/trac
 
 Alternatively, I think it would also work to make the plt-scheme.org
 links just all go to one fixed url instead of trying to make the old
 urls work, assuming that makes things easier somehow.

 OK, this sounds easy to do, assuming that forwarding is indeed done before
 trac gets control.  I'll do that when I get home later tonight.

 I think that I have all the right bits in place now.  The two
 redirections are done by this rule:
 
   RedirectMatch permanent ^/*(trac(/.*)?)?$ http://planet.racket-lang.org/$1
 
 Which means that http://planet.plt-scheme.org/trac/<whatever>
 redirects to http://planet.racket-lang.org/trac/<whatever>.  This is
 done as a permanent redirection, which is fitting for this case.
 
 I'm going to close this PR now, but it would be really good if more
 people will test that things work fine...  Also, if there are other
 URLs that should be redirected, please tell me and I'll add them.  As
 you can see, it's only a matter of finding a good regexp for what
 should be forwarded.  (The above regexp is a little complicated only
 because I went with the smartass way of a single regexp instead of two
 rules... but additions can be done on separate RedirectMatch rules.)
 
 
 
 Technical details, if you have some place to put such stories:
 
 I initially tried to do it in the rewrite rules in your local
 .htaccess file, but that doesn't work because trac is installed using
 ScriptAlias which happens before rewrites.  I then tried to see if I
 can mimic the ScriptAlias using rewrite rules instead, but this turns
 out to be pretty tricky (and reminded me that I had the same fight
 with the mailman setup -- only there I won...).  I had some more
 attempts to make it so that you get to control everything via
 .htaccess but I couldn't get anything practical going.  (Besides
 making it possible for you to edit it, it would have the benefit of
 being able to update it without restarting the server.)
 
 So the solution is to have two entries: the one for
 planet.racket-lang.org is the same as it was (and the rewrite rules
 are also the same).  planet.plt-scheme.org gets its own entry now,
 and it's identical to planet.racket-lang.org except for the above
 `RedirectMatch'.  (It also doesn't have the trac entry, since it's
 redirected anyway.)
