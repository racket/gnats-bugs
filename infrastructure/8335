 I don't understand what the problem is.  It sounds like Windows could
 not save the DrScheme installer -- maybe your hard disk is too full?
 Can you tell me exactly what you did, and also attach a picture of
 the screen with the error message?
 
 (You can reply to me in Hebrew if it's more convenient.)
