>Description:
I don't know if i am right in the bugs section, but...

Some time ago, DrScheme ran perfectly on my Maschine. But all off a sudden DrScheme.exe (and some other files) cannot be found (and not even installed, about 5 or 6 trys; both versions 103 and 102). I cleaned my registry by hand from any scheme-related lines, but still nothing. On my notebook the same plt.exe installs the programm as a whole, including DrScheme.
In fact, I can run any prompt-based version of scheme implemented in plt.exe...
Any suggestions?
Thank you
Dirk Fust

 It sounds like your file directories have been corrupted.
 
 You'll probably have to re-install DrScheme, which you can find at
