>Environment:
mac-ppc-osx
>Description:
The installations instructions were:

Downloading SGL
Version: 205  Platform: Mac OS X
File size: 0.15 MbDrag the downloaded file sgl-205.ppc-macosx.plt onto the Setup PLT application in the plt folder.

Actually there was no plt/ folder and no Setup PLT application.

There was a bin/ folder and a setup-plt script.

I ran the script with the .plt file as an argument and the installation of SGL went fine.
