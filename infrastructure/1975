plt/README mentions that it is difficult to do mzscheme scripts.
The way to do it is described in
plt/collects/doc/help/scheme/misc/script.html
However, the directory plt/collects/doc is not present in the binary
download for Solaris.

 The real bug is in the README file, because Help Desk 
 is not distributed with MzScheme.
 
 To write a shell script containing Scheme code, write:
 
   #!/bin/sh
   string=? ; exec ${PLTHOME}/bin/mzscheme -r $0 $0 ${1+"$@"}
 
   ... scheme-program ...
