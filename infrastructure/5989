 In general, the binary .rpm files only work with the version of RedHat
 they were compiled with.  Even if the .rpm script works, the libraries
 are likely to be incompatible.  Unfortunately, we haven't labelled the
 .rpms with the RH version number.
 
 For this reason, we may discontinue distribution binary .rpms.
 
 In the worst case, you should be able to use the source tar.gz and build
 binaries.
