 I looked into this, and it seems that there is no easy fix.  There is
 a "UAC" plugin for NSIS that can be used to do things like require
 elevated permissions, or execute a program without them.  But that's
 not a standard part of NSIS, and there is no easy way to just add a
 few lines to the installer script to use it.
 
 I happened to catch the developer on the NSIS irc channel, and his
 recommendation for a simple solution is to simply disable running
 DrScheme on Vista.  I committed this change, and the next build should
 hopefully include it.
 
 When the build is ready -- can you try out the nightly installer and
 see that it is getting disabled?  (I don't have a vista machine to try
 it on.)

 I just tried  
 http://pre.plt-scheme.org/installers/plt-4.2.0.3-bin-i386-win32.exe but it  
 asked to run DrScheme.  Is that the right nightly installer?

 I think that I finally got it to work.  Installing on XP works as
 before, and on Vista (and above) there should be no checkbox.  Can you
 verify that it is indeed not shown on Vista?

 I just verified that the checkbox is not there anymore.  Thanks!

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Wed, 10 Jun 2009 13:14:44 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed by disabling on vista and above.
