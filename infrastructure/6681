>Description:
I downloaded plt-206-bin-i386-win32.

It is only this large (ls -l provided by Cygwin):

 ~/wares $ ls -l ./plt-206-bin-i386-win32.exe
-rwx------+   1 metaperl None      7132927 Jan 31 05:06 ./plt-206-bin-i386-win32.exe
        ~/wares $ 

I downloaded from Northeastern University.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Thu, 01 Apr 2004 22:07:18 -0500
Reason: This was around the right size, anyway -- using new server 
now.
