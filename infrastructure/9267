>Description:
The DrScheme installation file for install from Unix sources seems to be corrupted. I could not open the file with a graphical zip client (file-roller), or extract it with the tar command.

the tar command fails with the following errors:

=======================================================
tar: Pulando para o próximo cabeçalho
tar: o arquivo-tar contém cabeçalhos base-64 obsoletos

gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--crc error

gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--length error
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Saída por erro atrasada pelos erros anteriores
======================================================

There are a few messages in portuguese in there, but it looks like tar is puking. The translation for the tar message is "the tar-archive has obsolete base-64 headers". gzip also points invalid compressed data.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) download the install from Unix source file, through the following link:

http://download.plt-scheme.org/drscheme/plt-372-src-unix-tgz.html

2) execute the command "tar xvzf plt-372-src-unix.tgz", which results in:

tar: Pulando para o próximo cabeçalho
tar: o arquivo-tar contém cabeçalhos base-64 obsoletos

gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--crc error

gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--length error
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Saída por erro atrasada pelos erros anteriores

 I just tried to download this file through the server, and things went
 fine.  I then got it from the other 5 mirrors, and all files were
 identical.  Perhaps you had a network problem?  Did you try a
 different mirror?
