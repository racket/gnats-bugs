>Description:
The "Report a Bug" page has the following at the top of the page:

"If you can, please use the Bug Report item in DrRacket's Help menu. It works better than this page, because it helps you supply precise information about your Racket installation and working environment."

But I DID get there via the "Report a Bug" (not "Bug Report") item in DrRacket's Help menu, and the information about my Racket installation and working environment WAS filled in.

Either the wording should be changed to "If you got here via... please use the Report a Bug item in DrRacket's Help menu instead...." or the system should detect how the user got there and only display the message if necesssary.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to the "Report a Bug" item via DrRacket's Help menu.

 I'm not sure what problem you're seeing exactly.
 
 * The menu item is called "Submit Bug Report" in the English version
   (I've updated the http://bugs.racket-lang.org/ web with the extra
   "Submit" now.)
 
 * When you choose that menu item, you should get a DrRacket dialog
   with a place to write the information -- and there's a "Show
   Synthesized Info" button that shows you the additional information
   it adds.
 
 * You should *not* get to the http://bugs.racket-lang.org/ page with
   that menu item, so something else might be wrong.
 
 * There is some limited information that is added when you use the web
   page form -- but that's just what your browser provides, so it can't
   get any information about your Racket setup.

 That's the problem then: you're going to the bug submission page from
 a documentation page -- and at this point the only available
 information on your setup is what the browser reports, and there's
 also the version bit which makes the documentation pages provide that
 too.
 
 What I'm talking about (and what the bugs page that you refer to asks
 for) is using DrRacket itself: in the help menu (of DrRacket) there is
 a "Submit Bug Report" item, which gives you a DrRacket dialog that
 asks for the same data that the web page does.  That dialog has the
 "show synthesized info" button, and if you click that you'll see that
 we're getting much more information when that dialog is used.

 I think the real issue here is that someone can easily press the F1
 key, get to the help desk, and believe that they are still in
 DrRacket.  This requires a perspective on web pages and applications
 that I don't think anyone on this list has, but one that is rapidly
 becoming more common, and it points to a need to explain things like
 this better.

 I understand now. I was puzzled because I did get there via the Help menu, but 
 via two steps (and a differently named item) rather than one. I'm not sure 
 whether many other people will do that. It would be possible to make the message 
 more explicit, but that would also make it wordier, and I'm not sure it's worth 
 it.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Alan
