Unpack mzscheme source code tar.gz file.  Enter folder files were extracted to in the terminal, enter ./install

Afterwards this message appears:
./install: line 15: /Share/plt/bin/mzscheme: No such file or directory
./install: line 15: exec: /Share/plt/bin/mzscheme: cannot execute: No such file or directory

Note that /Share/plt was the directory that I unpacked the mzscheme tar.gz file to.

This error message seems to indicate that the source code for mzscheme doesn't include the most important part: the actual code for mzscheme itself.

 The archive contains C source code for MzScheme, so you have to compile
 things first.
 
 Go into
 
   plt/src/
 
 run
 
   ./configure
   make
 
 *then* run
 
   ./install
 
 in the plt root.

 The source bundle doesn't have the mzscheme binary -- you need to build
 it! (that's why it is only the source). See the installation
 instructions in the .tar.gz file. Basically, you do this:
 
   cd plt/src
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   cd ..
   ./install
