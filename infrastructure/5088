>Description:
I am using DrScheme 103, Graphical Full Scheme, on a pc running Win2000 with 128MB RAM.
When the following program is saved on my hard drive, opened in DrScheme, and executed, 
it runs fine. But, when the program is saved on my A: drive, opened in DrScheme, and executed,
it does not run, but generates this error message in the interactions window:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 103.
Language: Graphical Full Scheme (MrEd).
build-path: expects type <string or 'up or 'same> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: "A:\\"
> 

Why is this?

Here's the program:


(define-macro cons-stream 
  (lambda (a b) (list 'cons a (list 'delay b))))

(define the-empty-stream ())
(define stream-null? null?)
(define (stream-car stream) (car stream))
(define (stream-cdr stream) (force (cdr stream)))

(define (display-stream-start s n)
  (if (<= n 0)
      (newline)
      (begin (display (stream-car s))
             (display ", ")
             (display-stream-start (stream-cdr s)
                                   (- n 1)))))

(define (stream-map proc . argstreams)
  (if (stream-null? (car argstreams))
      the-empty-stream
      (cons-stream
       (apply proc (map stream-car argstreams))
       (apply stream-map
              (cons proc (map stream-cdr argstreams))))))

(define (add-streams s1 s2)
  (stream-map + s1 s2))

(define integers (cons-stream 1 (add-streams ones integers)))
(define ones (cons-stream 1 ones))

(define (mul-streams s1 s2)
 (stream-map * s1 s2))

(define factorials (cons-stream 1 (mul-streams integers factorials)))

(display-stream-start factorials 6)

 It may help to set the:
 
   MREDDEBUG
 
 environment variable before starting drscheme to test this problem.
 That should tell which call to build-path is failing.
 
 (assuming that one of you is looking into this)

 Isn't this a known problem in 103? I thought it had to do with starting
 in the root directory (even on C:), or something like that.

 In DrScheme 103p1, I tried loading a file containing your program from a
 floppy disk
 
  - via the command line, and 
  - from the File | Open menu item
 
 In both cases, I had no problem.  Perhaps this problem was fixed for
 103p1, but not 103?
 
 I'm running Win2000.

 I do recall some problems like that, but I didn't realize it was in
 103p1; perhaps it was in 103, tho.
 
 Paul, did you "execute" the file, or just "open" it?

 And I ran DrScheme with MREDDEBUG set, nothing special happened.  The
 stdio window just showed all the collections being loaded.

 Does the error show up in the interactions window, or in an internal 
 error window?

 Oh, then my suggestion won't help.
