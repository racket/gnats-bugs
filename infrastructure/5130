 The problem is the special 200alpha4 bundle. It's not a real release,
 so the web directories above don't exist. At the same time, there's no
 "CVS" directory, so Help Desk doesn't point you to the pre-release
 docs.
 
 In other words, it's not a real bug, just an incomplete intermediate
 bundling.

 That's because 200alpha4 is not an official release, so there
 are no docs installed for it on the download server.
 
 I think that if you have a CVS tree, Help Desk will look for 
 pre-release docs on the download server.  Those docs 
 are available.
