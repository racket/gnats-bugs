>Description:
Doug Havlik claims he's submitted bug reports, but they aren't showing
up when he or I query.  We should amend the message printed out by
the bug report script to mention that the submitter can expect an
email message and, if they don't receive one, to complain to us.

Would Pablo like to take over that script?
