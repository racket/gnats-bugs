Hello!
 
I have a problem and hope you could help me.
I spent 2 hours trying to install DrScheme and I keep getting the message:
"Corrupt installation detected."
 
I have already tried the following to fix it:
 
> Downloaded installation file from different web sites
> Tried to install 2 different versions: p103 and 200
> Re-installed Windows on top of installed Windows (without erasing everything, reformatting etc.)
> On the web the only "help" it gives is:
" When I run plt.exe to install under Windows, it says ``corrupt installation detected.'' What went wrong? 
The real problem may be that the installer is unable to write the DrScheme files to your hard drive, or the installer may be unable to modify the Start menu. In this case, check to make sure there is disk space available, and contact your system maintainer to make sure that you have the appropriate access privileges."
 
Since I use Win98 and removed "Client for Microsoft Networks" (it doesn't prompt me for a username/passwd when booting up) I hardly see how it can be the access problem. I have more than 800Mb free on C drive => not a free space problem either. I don't know how Start menu can be involved but I checked the file /dir properties and it's not read-only.
 
I have no idea where to go from here and I really hate doing my assts in the lab.
The last resort is, of course, to format C and re-install Windows but this is by far the least desirable thing to do.
 
Do you have any idea / hint/ similar experience about how this problem can be fixed?
 
I would really appreciate it if you could help.
 
Thank you,
 
Best Wishes,
Arthur.

 From the DrScheme FAQ:
 
 	The real problem may be that the installer is unable to write
 the 	DrScheme files to your hard drive, or the installer may be
 unable 	to modify the Start menu. In this case, check to make sure there
 is disk space available, and contact your system maintainer to 	make
 sure that you have the appropriate access privileges.
