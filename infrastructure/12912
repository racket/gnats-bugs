>Description:
The logs at http://racket-lang.org/irc-logs/ are listed with the newest logs at the bottom of the page, instead of at the top.

I use this link to see recent logs that I missed because my client disconnected, and I assume others use the most recent logs more often than the oldest ones. Thus I think it would be smarter to put those at the top of the page.

Reason>>> Done.
