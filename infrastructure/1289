 Shawn,
 
        I am trying to installa and download the DrScheme-Jr software for 
        BeOS 4.5 but when I choose the platform button there are no options 
        for BeOS.  Is there a default selection here that is assumed that 
        maybe I am missing?
 
 DrScheme Jr is not available for BeOS.  You can download the 
 MzScheme sources for BeOS and compile them.  MzScheme does 
 everything that DrScheme Jr does, except for source correlation
 of errors.
 
 The MzScheme page is

 It's not officially supported.  Matthew Flatt suggests you could build
 MzScheme, then download a Unix source bundle for DrScheme Jr, replacing
 the .bin directory with the comparable BeOS directory.
 
 Unless you have a compelling need for Jr, I'd suggest sticking with
 MzScheme.
