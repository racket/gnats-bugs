>Description:
One of the MzScheme tests requires the lang collection;
something in the lang collection requires the framework
collection.

That means, for MzScheme bundles, an error is generated
during setup-plt.

Can/should this be resolved?
>How-To-Repeat:
Download a Mz alpha9 bundle, make .zo's.
