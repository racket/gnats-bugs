 If you actually click on them, they turn out to be http links that go
 where you want.

 I'm not sure whether you are refering to a different link then me or
 if your system is configured differently, but
 https://pkg.racket-lang.org/info/find-parent-dir has a git:// link
 whose href is a git:// address and wants to open up in XCode for me.

 Ah, this turns out to be a difference between using `git://` and
 `github://`.  See https://pkg.racket-lang.org/info/fancy-app for the
 latter, which works.
 
 I think the right solution is probably a "home page" field (with
 rel=nofollow for ring 2).
