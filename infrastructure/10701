For the past week or two I've been unable to use the "Submit Bug Report" menu item in DrScheme (variously in 4.2.2 and 4.2.3): it says "Submitting bug report...", waits for a while, then says "An error occurred when sending this bug report...."  So I've been using the Web interface as I'm doing now.  Whazzap?

 The server was upgraded late last week, so you might have tried it
 when the setup wasn't complete, but it's been up in complete shape for
 several days (at least since saturday or sunday), so it should be fine
 now.  Just in case, I just sent a bug report (from inside and outside
 NEU), and it worked fine.
