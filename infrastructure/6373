>Description:
After installing Dr. Scheme on an OSX (10.2.6) machine and sucessfully running it using the same account used to install the software, I attempted to launch and use Dr. Scheme on the same machine, using a non-administrative account. When I do so, I get the message:

standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found: "drscheme" in any of: (1)

(Exited)

 Am I wrong in thinking that should work, in principle?

 Yes. I wonder whether changing accounts somehow changes the way paths
 are interpreted (in particular, the installation directory).

 Hi,
 
   I've not been unable to reproduce the problem. It seems to run fine
 for me under os x 10.2.6 using a non-admin account that didn't install
 the software.
 
 Are you starting drscheme by double clicking on it?
 
 Also, can you run mzscheme (open the terminal and "cd" to the PLT
 folder and then the bin directory inside there and type "./mzscheme"
 (without the quotes)) and then paste this expression and send the
 results:
 
   (current-library-collection-paths)
 
 As a reference, here's what it looks like on my machine:
 
 [pingtung] ~/cvs% cd /Applications/PLT\ v204/bin/
 [pingtung] /Applications/PLT v204/bin% ./mzscheme
 Welcome to MzScheme version 204, Copyright (c) 1995-2003 PLT
 > (current-library-collection-paths)
 ("/Applications/PLT v204/bin/./../collects")
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
