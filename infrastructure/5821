I think the PLT manuals would look better in Help Desk
if they used a white background instead of a gray
background. 

The TeX2Page manual on denali has a white background. I 
like its appearance.

 I've changed the css.t2p on denali so that the manuals will build with a
 white background.  If people think the manuals look better this way,
 I'll commit the file to CVS.
 
 For a preview, look at the mzc manual on denali:

 Why not leave the background unspecified so that users can specify it
 themselves with browser default backgrounds?

 I specified my browser background preference to be white instead of
 grey once, a long time ago. It worked fine...until I visited a page
 with white text. Maybe people know to avoid white text now, but what if
 somone likes blue backgrounds? Creating documents in a language with no
 semantics and expecting it to work under different, arbitrary
 interpretations is just not a good idea.  Since we're stuck with HTML
 for now, the pages should specify as much as possible.
 
 IMHO,
 
 Paul

 The choice of both foreground and background
 color could indeed be left to the user, with one
 caveat:
 
 PLT's typeset Scheme code has (by necessity) picked
 some colors for the various Scheme token categories.
 User choice of fg/bgcolor should not conflict with
 these.  
 
 At the very least, bgcolor should be something "light"
 and fgcolor should be something "dark".  If the user's
 default violates this, PLT's typeset code could become
 unreadable.  Even if the bg is light and the fg is
 dark, some of the tokens may no longer signal their
 category as intended, even if they remain
 readable.
 
 Perhaps someone with a more intimate knowledge of the
 cascading-stylesheet mechanism than I can suggest
 how to make the Scheme token colors a _function_ of the
 lightness/darkness of the fg and the bg.
