>Description:
If I install DrScheme as Administrator and then login as myself, I do not see the DrScheme folder on the Programs menu. Seen on a Windows 2000 SP3 box, DrScheme 202.
>How-To-Repeat:
Find a Windows NT 2000 or XP PC that does not have DrScheme installed, for a clean install.
Login as Administrator, install DrScheme.
Login as another user; do you see the PLT entry in the programs menu?

Best, Mark

 Apparently, this is a bug/feature of the Wise Installation system:
 
   http://www.wise.com/displayArticle.asp?articleno=1307
 
 Even though the shortcuts have the "Enable for all NT users" toggle
 ticked, it doesn't seem to work that way.
 
 For the next release, the target directory will be "plt" instead of
 "PLT".  If the cited article is correct, that will fix the problem.
 
 Thanks for the report.

    Fixed.  New installer puts all links for all users, except for "Uninstall", visible only to installing user.
