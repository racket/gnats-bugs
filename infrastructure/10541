>Description:
Some people are interested in only the REPL that PLT provides. You can get this via the MzScheme package but it is not obvious to the casual investigator.

It has been mentioned maybe twice in the mailing list, and it came up here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1603629/what-is-the-best-scheme-implementation-for-sys-admin-shell-scripts

The thing is that some people only want the REPL and won't download PLT because it is "too big".

This is an obstacle to people using PLT.

Perhaps MzScheme could be advertised on the main page to remove that obstacle.
