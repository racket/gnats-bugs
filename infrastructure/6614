>Environment:
mac-ppc-macos
>Description:
Web site silently fails to produce any data (except an empty body) when you request the MacOS Classic PowerPC version of 205. 

It seems that such a file does not exist. Release notes claim that 205 is the last version that will support Classic, but maybe you should change that to 204. 

In general, the error message page should probably say what version is the last available for the given platform (if "latest" is not it).

The plt-205.ppc-mac.tar.gz file does not contain any binaries or src (even if you manage to find it), so its purpose was unclear to me, but obviously it is not what I was looking for.

In anycase, I am sure that 204 will be sufficient for my needs. 
(And obviously you have few mac os classic users.)



>How-To-Repeat:
Go to download site.
Select 205 (latest) and MacOS Classic (PowerPC)
See empty document.
