>Description:
In the past, if I started at help desk's
front page and navigated to the external
libraries page (on a utah server) and chose
a .plt file, I would be asked to install it.
Now, I am asked to save the file and then
nothing happens.

This is esp. bad on macos x, where clicking on
the .plt file doesn't do anything.

 That's probably a Web server issue.
 
 In Apache, at least, you can specify a MIME type for .plt files.

 I see two possibilities for fixing this:
 
   1) improve the platform-specific support for double-clicking on .plt
      files [Matthew: is that feasible?]
 
   2) special case this web page: rather than have the help desk pages
      point to the web page at utah, have the help desk pages point to a
      servlet that downloads an sexp from utah. This sexp contains all
      of the info about the packages. The web server generates a web
      page with links to the .plt files that go to a different servlet
      to install the web pages.

 In Windows Explorer, clicking on a .plt file already installs it.  But
 because of the Web server issue, I still get a blob of bytes in a Web
 page when I click on the file at Utah.

 Right -- and under macos x, this should also be fixable but it doesn't
 work yet. I suspect that it will never work for unix.

 I actually prefer that one, but if we can get something else working,
 that would also be fine for me.

 For OS X, eventually.
 
 (On my machine, .plt is currently mapped to Graphics Converter, so that
 could be a problem.)

 I updated the .htaccess file for Utah, but many .plt files live
 elsewhere.

 I like this idea, but it needs a new do-it-yourself contrib site. (I
 have a start at a new site, but I haven't had time to finish it.)

 according to: 
 
   http://www.ace.net.nz/tech/TechFileFormat.html
 
 .plt is mapped to both "HPGL Plotter drawing" and "AutoCAD Plot
 drawing". sigh.

 What did you have to put in there? I'd like to add it to the place
 where my .plt file resides.

 What did you have in mind? Something where outsiders could add their
 own packages?

 Yes. And something that supports a protocol to easily upload new
 packages and revisions (i.e., we'd provide an `upload-package' Scheme
 function).

 Thanks. I've stuck that as the only think in my .htaccess file, but
 I'll have to wait to test it I guess.

 Were you thinking of having authentication somehow?
 
 I think that we need to make these add-on packages more prominent,
 somehow. Perhaps we should also include abstracts and a way to search
 them.
 
 I just went to look at the sources for Help Desk, but it doesn't seem
 to be in iplt/doc/help anymore. What happened?

 I guess this is OK, and if it works nicely it's great.  
 
 I just worry that we're making an additional maintenance burden on
 ourselves.  Also, if the links in the sexp get rotten, or if the .plt
 doesn't install properly because of a versioning error, it won't be so
 pleasant for users.
 
 The fundamental problem, that we're depending on the accuracy of the
 info supplied by 3rd parties, and the proper configuration of their
 hosts, doesn't disappear.

 In my (unimplemented!) plan for a .plt distribution server, the server
 would automatically unpack and test any uploaded .plt file.
 
 It would be impossible to completely test an archive, especially if it
 somehow conflicts with some other archive, but I imagine that simple
 testing would eliminate most trouble: version mismatches, missing
 dependency declarations, etc.

 After testing, would the .plt file reside at Utah, or would it remain on
 the contributor's host?

 At Utah --- or wherever the machine sits, though I have an old machine
 that I expect to put to use for this task.
