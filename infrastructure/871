>Description:
I tried to gunzip several of the PS files on  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/Publications/.

Turns out they're not compressed, although they have the .gz extension.

I wasted quite a bit of time trying to find a "correct" version of gzip to get these files uncompressed.

Please put a note on the page or otherwise help us out.

Thanks,
Cy

 I'm sorry, but your error report is rather unhelpful.  Perhaps you
 could send me a specific URL (ie, of a file that is supposed to be
 gzip'ed but isn't), so I can look into the matter.  (Perhaps there's a
 problem with your Web browser?  I assume you saw the note at the top
 of the page?)
 
 Thanks.

 Possibly the server or his netscape unzipped them without telling him. This has happened to me before. I
 forget which platform.
