>Description:
Currently the nightly builds do not have an option for a 64bit OS X build. Since this is a supported build, and there is an option for both 32 and 64 bit Linux, I think it should be added to the nightly builds.

Reason>>> Builds happen on real machines, and there is currently no 64 bit OS X
machine build on.  If you have such a machine in a dept environment
then I can add it to the build cycle.  (But in general our experience
with doing anything with brown wasn't great due to strict security.)
