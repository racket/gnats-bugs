Currently, there is no x64 version for Windows. Ideally, there would be an x64 version to better utilize x64 hardware. However, 32-bit version works fine so far on Windows Vista Ultimate x64.

 Machine contributions are welcome...  In other words, there is a
 5-year-old Windows machine which is currently used to build the
 Windows binaries.  (It will probably take some tweaks to stuff in
 worksp too.)

 The main problem is that the machine is old and slow, adding another
 build will make the build process almost twice longer than it is now.
 But another thing is that mzscheme is used by the build process, which
 will be a problem.

 I'm not sure how the tracking system gets used, but in most cases
 closing or resolving as later issues such as this just causes them to be
 forgotten about. This may not be the case though with this issue
 tracker.

 As I said earlier on this thread, having an x64 build is not feasible
 at this time.  There are three potential options to have it:
 
 * Use DevStudio's cross-compilation
 
 * Use a virtual machine
 
 * Have an x64 machine
 
 The first will require that MzScheme itself do cross-compilation,
 since it is used in the build process.  This will require major work
 on MzScheme, making it think that it lives on a different platform
 than it actually is running on.  Also, it will still require having
 another machine for the build.
 
 Using a virtual machine for the build requires having a machine that
 will run the VM -- using an existing machine will not be good since
 the build process is quite heavy.  Plus, at least as much as I've seen
 with VMware, 64-bit support on a 32-bit architecture is experimental.
 
 So the most viable option is to have an x64 machine -- and that will
 have to wait until it becomes popular enough that there is such a
 machine in the PLT group (or someone who can donate their machine's
 time for a daily build).  Or wait until we get enough money that we
 can afford getting a machine dedicated for these builds.
 
 In any case, we will get there naturally, as the x64 platform becomes
 more popular.  So this report will be forgotten, but the issue will
 definitely not be.
 
 (FWIW, it's the same with other platforms as well -- we have no 64
 build for any architecture, since we have no 64 bit machines that are
 in use.)
