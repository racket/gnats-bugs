 Beau,
 
        just after i click on plt.exe i get an error message:
        "System DLLs corrupt or missing"
 
 
 One possibility is you're low on disk space, or you're unable 
 to modify the Start menu.  Have you tried installing as Administrator?

 On deja.com, I found the following:
 
 	>When I try and install Forte Agent I get a corrupt installation error.
 
 	If you are getting the message
 	Corrupt or missing DLL`s
 	the usual cause is that the WISE installation program (which installs
 Agent)
 	needs the VER.DLL library.  Check in the 	\windows\system and
 \windows\system32
 	directories for a missing, zero-sized or otherwise corrupted VER.DLL and
 	replace it.
 
 Perhaps you're encountering the same problem.

 I don't know what's going wrong, then.  We haven't heard from other 
 Windows users about this problem.  Presumably, there's some .DLL
 that the Wise installer is complaining about.  I tried looking through
 the PLT.EXE executable with an editor, but I don't see any specific 
 .DLL's in strings.
 
 If you have access to another machine, you could install there,
 then zip up the installed directories, and copy to your own machine.
 You'd be missing some registry entries for launching DrScheme on
 .ss and .scm files and the Start menu entries.

 I wish I knew.  The installation uses the Wise Installer, and we don't 
 know exactly what it does.  As I indicated, I looked through the 
 install executable for names of .DLL's, and I didn't see any.
 
 Glad it's working now.
