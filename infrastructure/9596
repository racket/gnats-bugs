Gnatweb queries saved with Safari sometimes get corrupted, so that when you submit the stored query you see all issues. Searching for your name in the originator field is an example. This doesn't seem to happen with Firefox.

Workaround: click View for bookmarking before storing the query.
>How-To-Repeat:
Safari 3

enter something in the originator field

submit query

store query as "test"

click quick query

submit stored query "test"

 We didn't write Gnatsweb, and besides a few minor tweaks, we have the
 most recent version of it (and of gnats).  But gnats does have some
 issues with parsing queries, and I'm sure that gnatsweb has it's share
 of additional problems.
 
 The bottom line is that gnats and gnatsweb are old, unmaintained
 projects.  I think that the best option is to switch to something
 better -- either write a new system in Scheme, or install one of the
 more modern systems -- both seem to me on the same level of time
 investment (about a week, I think).
 
 Besides that, there is not much to do about any gnats/gnatsweb
 problems...

 I hear you. I figured I would at least note the issue so others can  
 step around it.
 
 I admire the system's efficiency and lack of fluff. It's one of the  
 more useful bugtrackers that I've come across. I was sorry to see it's  
 been a dead project since 2004 (but maybe that's the secret  
 ingredient ?) There'd be no harm in rewriting it in plt scheme all the  
 same.

 That was exactly what I thought about it -- it's extremely flexible
 and yet simple enough to hack, I find it much better than the new
 monsters that require many components before you can even install
 them...  I contacted the maintainer about the parsing issues, and he
 said that he barely has time for it, but he is using it.

 [Well, except for the time lost not doing other things...]

 FWIW, I think your "about a week" for the time required to write a
 good bug tracker is an underestimate.
 
 Jamie is investigating trac. Lets see how that goes and maybe we'll
 switch over to it if it works out well for planet.

 There were actually two estimates there: one for installing a new
 system and switching to it.  The major things that will be needed are
 getting all the packages installed and working, customizing the new
 system and accompanying components, and migrating all existing bugs to
 it.  I think that a day for each of these, and two days for the last
 item are conservative enough.
 
 As for writing a new system, there is very little that gnats is
 actually doing.  You need (a) a representation for the bug files, one
 that can have an arbitrary set of values and makes things like queries
 easy, (b) implement updating these attributes in a way that is
 recorded, (c) implement the basic machinery of parsing incoming emails
 (mostly to extract attachements, otherwise you just store them) and a
 web interface, and (d) the workflow (bug states, owners, etc).  (a) is
 easy when you have sexprs (and `s-exp<->fasl' makes it efficient); (b)
 can be done easily by delegating to a subversion backend; and (c) is
 mostly using existing libraries.  One day for the first two and one
 for the third is plenty -- and about 5 days for the last should be
 enough.
 
 (And BTW, I *have* implemented a bug-tracking system in the past, and
 IFAIK they're (www.dalet.com) still using it.  This was on Lotus Notes
 which gave us a good backend + gui, and a bad language to work with.
 PLT+svn would be a much better base to build on.)

 Waiting was not an issue -- I didn't plan to do anything anyway...
 (Unless there was enough pressure...)

 Me too (http://zwiki.org/IssueTracker), and I think a week  
 underestimates the details, even for someone good with PLT scheme like  
 yourself. Anything integrating with email takes longer. I don't think  
 you could do it.</transparent attempt to provoke coding>
