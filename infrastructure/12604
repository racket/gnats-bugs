>Description:
At 'http://pre.racket-lang.org/binaries/' there is a link for the 32-bit binaries, but no link to the 64-bit binaries.

On 'http://pre.racket-lang.org/binaries/i386-win32/' there is a link to the 64-bit binaries which is broken.
Link goes to 'http://pre.racket-lang.org/binaries/i386-win32/x86_64-win32' 
instead of
'http://pre.racket-lang.org/binaries/x86_64-win32/'

 That page is completely messed up due to a typo that has been there,
 surprisingly, for about 4 years...  I've fixed it, but in the
 meanwhile: are you sure that you need these binaries?
 
 (To explain, the fact that nobody saw this bug for so long is because
 they are rarely being used.  If you have an interesting use case, it
 might worth describing -- like the original intention of updating the
 repository and using these as a quick way to get the compiled files
 updated without actually doing a build.)
