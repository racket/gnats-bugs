 OK, next question:
 
   How many files do you have in the directory where you're installing
 DrScheme?  There is a limit -- 127, I think -- in Win98.
 
   Are you able to install into a directory other than the default?

 OK, here's what the Wise Knowledgebase says.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This error can be caused for a few reasons. 
 
 1) The Windows directory is full or is write-protected. 
 
 2) The user accessed the installation executable via a UNC pathname. 
 
 3) Under NT4, on a 16 bit install, the installation executable or the
 directory that it is being run from, contains an accented
 (international) character within the first eight characters. 
 
 4) The installation executable is not the same size as it was when it
 was compiled. This can happen from errors during transport.
