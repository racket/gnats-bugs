i made the include directory and copied various .h files from src/mzscheme/include, but then the make install bombs with something else (which i can reproduce if you want, but don't have available right now)

thx

 That was a problem that got fixed some time ago, but there were issues
 with some of the mirror sites that didn't update the files.  If you
 were using the Utah mirror, then it got updated today.  If you used
 some other site then please let me know so I can notify them.
 
 In the meanwhile, you can now re-download it from either the
 Northeastern or the Utah mirrors and it should be fine.
 
 (I will close the bug now.)
