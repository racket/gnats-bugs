Hello,

I tried to download the intallation file, but found all versions
corrupted in the installation part.
If you can tell me, where i can found other servers to download
the DrSceme, it would be much helpfull.

thanks in advance
Chanan Berler
>How-To-Repeat:
At first time i tried to intall the DrSceme, but found a message
telling me the file is corrupted. I tried it also in my collage, where
there is more suitable downloading rate, but still it has said the same.

Remark: while DrSceme was corrupted, i tried downloading the DrSceme jr
and it was o.k

 Did the installation program say "Corrupt installation detected"?
 
 DrScheme uses the Wise installer.  Here's what the Wise Knowledgebase
 has to say about this problem:
 
 ----------
 
 Error Message
 When trying to execute the installation executable, the following error
 message is displayed: Corrupt Installation Detected
 
 
 Cause
 This error can be caused for a few reasons.
 
 1) The Windows directory is full or is write-protected.
 
 2) The user accessed the installation executable via a UNC pathname.
 
 3) Under NT4, on a 16 bit install, the installation executable or the
 directory that it is being run from, contains an accented
 (international) character within the first eight characters.
 
 4) The installation executable is not the same size as it was when it
 was compiled. This can happen from errors during transport.

 Do any of these apply to your situation?
