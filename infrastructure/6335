>Description:
The source file name, plt.src.x.tar.gz, is unversioned. This makes it difficult to package, track and maintain archives of historical releases.

Is there any way you could be presuaded to include the version number in your source file drops?

 I think we can start including the version number in the name with
 v205. We'll also try to rename older versions, but I'm not sure whether
 we'll be able to get to it soon.
