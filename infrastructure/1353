	Hello,
I am unable to use the binary code with the 6.1 Red Hat version.
("segmentation fall" when I run DrSchene, before anything start)
The binary code doesn't compile correctly with this version.
(MrEd ... something doesn't work, MzScheme compilation seems ok)

Did I somthing wrong or someone has already report such a bug.

sorry for such a bad english.

	Best regards.

Guillaume

 Here's what it says on the download page for DrScheme:
 
 	WARNING: The Linux binary was compiled with a stock RedHat 5.2
 distribution.
 	With other varieties of Linux (Debian, or other versions of Red Hat, for
 example),
 	you may have difficulties due to library incompatibilities. If you
 experience crashes,
 	especially when opening Help Desk, try downloading and compiling source
 code instead.
 	Source code is available through the DrScheme download page.
 
 So go to http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/ and download the
 "Unix/X" sources, and recompile MzScheme and MrEd.  DrScheme should
 run fine after that.

 Sorry, I didn't read your message carefully when I responded before.
 What goes wrong when you try to compile MrEd?

 	Hello,
 thanks for our consideration.
 The think is that I'm not verry in with makefile, C libreries and so on.
 
   * Probably the XLIB and/or XINCLUDE directory lists must be
      adjusted.
 
 And indeed this was the problem:
 
 
 -I/usr/X11R6/include/X11 -> -I/usr/X11R6/include
 
 Sorry but I just did not know where to look at.
 
 Regards.
