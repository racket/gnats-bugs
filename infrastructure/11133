>Description:
I'm interested in writing some mred widgets. Where can I find code, for example, to draw a button in the OS-specific style. Obviously, I can extend the canvas% class to do some custom drawing, but I'd prefer to have my widgets match the OS style.

 It's best to ask this question on the mailing list -- see
