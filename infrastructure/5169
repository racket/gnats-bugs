>Description:
I'm trying to install DrScheme on my computer, but keep getting the error message that an I/O error occurred while installing a file, and that the installation file is probably corrupt.  I'm attempting to install version 101 for Windows 95/98/NT/2000; I'm using Windows 2000.  Version 101 is required for the class I'm taking--the instructor specifically requested this version as opposed to later versions.  I have attempted to install on both the C and D drives; free hard drive space is not the problem.  The error always occurs when the file rep.ss is being copied, and occurs regardless of whether I try to use the single archive or the one split up for floppies.  I was only able to download the files from Rice--I got a DNS error at the French site and the German site gave me no response.  I was able to download and install version 103 with no problems.

Any suggestions as to what the problem might be?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
>How-To-Repeat:
Straightforward installation procedure; see above.

 DrScheme uses the Wise installer.  According to the Wise
 KnowledgeBase, this problem is due to:
 
 	1) The Windows directory is full or is write-protected.
 
 	2) The user accessed the installation executable via a UNC pathname.
 
 	3) Under NT4, on a 16 bit install, the installation executable 
 	or the directory that it is being run from, contains an 
 	accented (international) character within the first eight characters.
 
 	4) The installation executable is not the same size as it was 
 	when it was compiled. This can happen from errors during transport.
 
 This is an old entry, so I'd guess that (3) applies to Win2000, too.
 
 Do any of these descriptions fit your situation?

 Well, I finally got it to work.  I went to another computer on the
 network 
 and downloaded it--it installed fine there.  I copied the installation
 file 
 from that computer over to mine; it installed perfectly.  Life with
 Windows 
 is an eternal series of    unsolved mysteries.
