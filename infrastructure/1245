When I want to launch DrScheme, Games, Help Desk or MrEd, it doesn't work !
But I can launch very well DrScheme Jr or Mzc or Mzscheme...
I don't understand why !
The program isn't responding...
I uninstall it once, and after re-download it and re-install it, but it still doesn't work !

Thanks for answer me quickly (I've got a work to do on it in 3 days !)

        When I want to launch DrScheme, Games, Help Desk or MrEd, it 
        doesn't work !
        But I can launch very well DrScheme Jr or Mzc or Mzscheme...

        but it still doesn't work !
 
 My guess is there may have been files left after the uninstall.
 
 After uninstalling, use Explorer to delete the entire PLT directory by 
 dragging it to the trash bin.  Then reinstall.
 
 Another guess: how much disk space do you have left after installation?
