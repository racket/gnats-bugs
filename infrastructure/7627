>Description:
When I went to download DrScheme, nothing happens on the download page, even after I click the download button. This may just be my computer being strange, but if not, it may be a big problem. If you could maybe send me to another place where I could find a link to download I would be very satisfied. Thanks!
>How-To-Repeat:
On home page; I click "Download DrScheme"; I click "Windows (95 and up) x85", then "Download"; It just sits at the next page.

 Hi moegopher,
 
 You asked about where to get the download link to DrScheme; I'll assume
 that you're looking for DrScheme 209.  You can find download links here:
 
     http://download.plt-scheme.org/drscheme/plt-209-bin-i386-win32-exe.html
 
 Hope this helps!

Reason>>> I'm assuming things are working fine,
reopen if not.
