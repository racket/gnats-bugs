 Has anyone who uses windows 2000 been able to reproduce this problem? I
 don't see any problem like that under linux.
 
 Thanks,

 Hi,
 
 We're having trouble reproducing the problem. Can you be more 
 specific about what you do, what you expect, and what you see? I'm 
 hoping for step by step instructions from a newly started drscheme.
 
 Thanks!

 The strange thing is that we don't have a "Search" in the menu bar -- 
 we only have a "Find" in the "Edit" menu. Is that what you mean?
