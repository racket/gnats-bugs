>Description:
I would expect to find a way to report bugs in the community section rather than the documentation section of the Racket web site. I see why it would be useful to have one in the documentation section, but I would suggest adding one to the community section as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Imagine you are someone with a preconception (whether correct or not) that documentation is for your information and that the community section is where you would do stuff like ask questions or report bugs. Then go to the community page and wonder whether you should just submit bugs to the dev mailing list.
