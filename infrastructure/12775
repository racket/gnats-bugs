>Description:
hello,

if I visit the page:
http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=12774
(a report I submitted yesterday), then I click on 'standard query', I unselect 'ignore closed', I select 'originated by you', then 'submit query', I am shown two reports, none of which submitted by me.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Thu, 24 May 2012 16:02:42 -0400
Reason>>> The "originated by you" checkbox applies to the currently logged-in user, which
means that it's a feature that is pretty much useless.  The reason for it is that
gnats allows the notion of registered bug submitters, but we're not using it.
To see your bugs you can put your name or your email in the "Multi-line Text
Search" text field.

This is not a solution to the real problem though.  To address that (and other
problems with the current ancient setup), we're in the process of eventually
migrating our bug database to github.
