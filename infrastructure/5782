This pretty much says it all:

   $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.plt-scheme.org:/cvs login
   (Logging in to anonymous@anoncvs.plt-scheme.org)
   CVS password: [just hit return]

   cvs [login aborted]: recv() from server anoncvs.plt-scheme.org: EOF
   $ 

Similar result if I just try to check out without logging in (although I would expect the checkout to fail anyway, since the login never succeeded, still it should fail with a clean error, not an EOF).

Thanks,
-Karl

 Did login used to work for you?
 
 I just tried an update from the server -- no problems here.

 Another data point: the nightly Windows builds, which rely on anonymous
 CVS, proceeded without error last night.

 I never got a cvg login to succeed, no.
 
 Since it seems to be working for you, I'll just try again and see what
 happens, maybe it was just "cosmic rays".
 
 Thanks for the prompt response,
