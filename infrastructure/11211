Code samples on the racket-lang.org home page are too big and overlap the "Download Racket" link.  (I'm not sure this is a reportable bug, but samth says it is.)  This in the latest Google Chrome (6.0.472.55) on Mac OS X 10.6.4.  I haven't adjusted the fonts or the font size.

>How-To-Repeat:
Visit http://racket-lang.org/ using Google Chrome (6.0.472.55) on Mac OS X (10.6.4).  Click through the code snippets until you find a wide one.

 I just downloaded google chrome for the mac and pointed it at
 racket-lang.org, but everything seemed fine to me. (I didn't even open
 the preferences dialog.)
 
 So maybe a screenshot would help.

 Whoops, sorry. I missed the url below. Anyways, here's what I see for that =
 one:
 
   http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/tmp/racket-lang-org-screen-shot.p=
 ng
 
 I'm not sure what that tells us, tho, about how to fix the problem.

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Wed, 15 Sep 2010 21:29:27 -0400
Reason>>> .

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Wed, 15 Sep 2010 21:29:27 -0400
Reason>>> I've split the comment on two lines, so this example should
work fine, hopefully.  I'm closing it now, but if you see a
problem in other examples, tell me and I'll try to make them
narrower too.
