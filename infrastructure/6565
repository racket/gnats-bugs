>Description:
I had a copy of DrScheme on Mac OSX 10.2.8 and ran into a problem
and attempted to re-install.  When I downloaded the v205 .dmg
package, I followed the installation instructions, first running the
.mkpg and then moving the PLT v205 folder to /usr/local, and then
running the Finish Install .app in /usr/local/'PLT v205'.
This all seemed to work fine, except that I can't find a DrScheme
.app  anywhere (MrEd.app is there).  I don't see it even in the 
PLT Scheme v205 volume that the .dmg expands into.  Shouldn't it
be present in the binary distribution?

 It should be present -- in fact, the Finish Install should have created
 it.
 
 Can you send the contents of the Finish Install window (just re-run and
 then copy and paste).
 
 Thanks,
 Robby

 DrScheme.app is not in the distribution.  Rather, it is (or should be)
 created by running setup-plt, which is essentially what the Finish
 Install application does.  So  yes, you should have a DrScheme.app
 in /usr/local/PLT v205, but no, it's not surprising that it doesn't 
 appear
 in the .dmg anywhere.
 
 On a related note, I surmise (based on your choice of /usr/local/ as the
 install location) that you're not unfamiliar with the shell.  Did Finish
 Install create a 'drscheme' shell script in /usr/local/PLT v205/bin ?  
 If
 so, you may use this shell script to start DrScheme.
 
 Note that this would be at best a workaround; if the DrScheme.app
 doesn't show up, it sounds like a bug.

 Yes, that is one problem. You must have permission to write there when
 you run Finish Install.
