>Environment:
windows "Windows NT 5.0 (Build 2195) Service Pack 2" (win32\i386) (get-display-depth) = 32
Docs Installed:
("help" "icons" "teachpack" "r5rs" "mzscheme" "mzlib" "mred" "drscheme" "misclib" "framework" "tools" "mzc")

>Description:
Clicking "Cancel" in the bug report form pops a window
that asks for confirmation.  It has the wrong default:
"Yes" (which would cause the user to lose everything
they have typed).

>How-To-Repeat:
  Help Desk
+ Submit a Bug Report
+ Cancel
+ space bar
= poof!

 Also, the Organization should be "plt" instead of "titan".
