Selecting "Help Desk" fails, apparently due to a missing file or invalid path.
>How-To-Repeat:
Safari was open at the time. I just installed the nightly build and chose "Help Desk". The error was:

0:75: execution error: File some object wasn't found. (-43)
browser-run: process execute failed: (#<path:/usr/bin/osascript> "-e" "open location \"file:///Applications/PLT%20Scheme%20v4.0.2.6/doc/index.html\"")

Reason>>> fixed

 Yes, there was a problem in the build, which was also the same problem
 with docs.plt-scheme.org.  It's fixed now, and the new nightly build
 should work fine.
