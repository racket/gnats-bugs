>Description:
spidey reports the inferred type for certain "primitives" 
rather than the given types or (prim ...) types, no matter 
what the preferences are set to
>How-To-Repeat:
Type in program like this: 

(define (test)
  (let ([in (read)]) 
    (regexp-match "Hellow World" in)))

(test)

Analyze.

See regexp-match turned red. Which is okay, because 
the first argument isn't necessarily a string. 

But, just for fun click on regexp-match and see its
type: it seems to say that the function consumes 
what the arguments are. 

Replace regexp-match with string=? and you will get 
the same results.

 In this program, in 103, the type for regexp-match is
 
   (_ _ _ *-> (union false nil (cons str (listof str))))
 
 Same type in 102.
 
 Same type in 101.
 
 Same type in 100.
 
 Same type in 53.
