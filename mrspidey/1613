>Description:
Analyze the following program. 
It will signal a single check: (min-bt ...) in is-bst? 
This shouldn't happen. Spidey used to "know" that once 
the function is defined it is okay to apply it. Something
is wrong here.

;; Tree = number | (make-node Tree number Tree)

;; is-bst? : Tree -> bool

    [else (<= (min-bt (node-lft a-bt)) (node-val a-bt))]))

;; make-selector : (number number number -> number) -> (Tree -> number)

 When did this work correctly?
 
 The same result occurs in DrScheme/Spidey v53, so my guess is
 that it never worked correctly.
 
 I think the thing to do is to topological-sort procedure definitions,
 if possible.

 Hmph .. I was pretty sure that it worked at some point. We should get it to
 work
