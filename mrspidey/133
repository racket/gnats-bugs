	use spidey on ~matthias/Spidey/visitor.ss
	it high-lights the + 1 in the toString visitor
	since the 1 is a num :), 
	ask for the vsd of the second set and then ask for path to source
	this draws a pointer to the 0 and nothing else, which can't be right

This behavior is correct. path-to-source looks for a single example of
a path from a constructor expression matching the current filter.
