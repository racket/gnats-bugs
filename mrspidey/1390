>Description:
Find path to source in the analyzer had a problem with the following program.
     
>How-To-Repeat:
Write this program and analyze it, then get the "path to source" of the "x" in the body of the let and it goes to the string:

(define x 1)
(define f (lambda (x) x))
(let ((x (f x)))
  x)
(define z (f "foo"))

        (define x 1)
        (define f (lambda (x) x))
        (let ((x (f x)))
          x)
        (define z (f "foo"))
 
 Yes, a definite bug.  I tried DrScheme version 53 and got the 
 same error.  Spidey is easily tricked on top-level procedure
 definitions.  We're reworking the way the top-level is handled, 
 but be patient.
