FreeBSD, new-world, 49/20, default .mred.prefs file.

>Description:
	
The (internal only) online documentation for Spidey (see section on
"Potential Run-Time Errors") says:

  Any function that may be applied to an incorrect number of arguments 
  is highlighted by displaying the lambda keyword in red, and any 
  application expression where the function sub-expression may return
  a non-closure is highlighted by displaying the enclosing parentheses 
  in red. 

But running Spidey on the trivial file

  ((lambda (x) x) 1 2 3)

Produces no checks or warnings and doesn't put "lambda" (or anything
else) in red.

That was a bug originating when case lambda was introduced. It is not
fixed, and in the test suite.
