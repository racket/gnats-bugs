>Description:
When analyze is clicked on an empty buffer, the program thinks for a very long time.
I thought the program had halted. I'm on a 166MHz machine, so 10 seconds is a darned long time.

This is abnormal behavior, because hitting the wrong button on an empty buffer should not cause the system to hang 
that long.

Mind you, if you had distributed the source code with this distribution
I could be fixing these things now instead of bothering you.





>How-To-Repeat:
Hit analyze on an empty buffer..

 Shriram said he was going to. I will add a dialog box explaining what's
 happening, while it loads.
