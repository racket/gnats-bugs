>Description:
when we write programs that dynamically 
load unit/sigs and invoke then, it would 
be neat to know that load returned a unit/sig 
(okay, I can do this) and has the appropriate
signature. In principle, I don't need 
unit/sig? but 

 (load-unit/sig path cgi^)

where cgi^ is some sig and if load returns, it has 
produced a unit/sig with cgi^ as the import signature. 

I don't know what to do about exports.
