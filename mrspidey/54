drscheme -x on nw
>Description:
1. I started up DrScheme to check out this neat new icon.  With an
empty buffer I clicked on Analyze.  Nothing appeared to happen for
several seconds, but I didn't have control of DrScheme and I didn't
get a watch cursor either.

2. Eventually, a whole bunch of stuff got printed out:
let*-vals 1
let*-vals 2
let*-vals 3
let*-vals 4
let*-vals 5
let*-vals 6
...
let*-vals 76
It would be nice if this debugging output weren't in the -x version.

3. I got an error saying Spidey couldn't analyze an empty file.  So I
put (define x 3) in the buffer and clicked on Analyze.  I got a
warning that the file wasn't saved; I clicked on the helpfully named
button, "Analyze anyway".  The warning disappeared to be replaced by a
"Static Debugger Error" window that said

  The Static Debugger can only process programs that are saved to a
  file
