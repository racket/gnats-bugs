I tried to repeat the bug, and failed. 

I had been releasing a new version just at that time spidey diverged
on you, which could have been the problem.

 Additional comments:
 	We should be able to use BREAK to stop runaway tools
 
 	Killing DRScheme from X does not kill the process. I had
 	to kill it by hand still!

 This may be just a memory (RAM) problem.  Really.
 What type of machine is leto, and how much memory?
 If it's less than 32, once you get X, netscape, emacs,
 and then load drscheme/spidey, you'll page and performace
 will degrade by a factor > 100.
 
 Try it again on a machine that you know has plenty of
 memory.  Say, asia for solaris, or new-world.
