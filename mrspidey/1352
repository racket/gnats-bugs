 John,
 
        When I ask MrSpidey to download it tells me I must first 
        download and install DrScheme.  However, DrScheme is already 
        installed.  Any ideas?? Thanks.
 
 If you mean the message on the download page:
 
    MrSpidey is an extension to DrScheme, so download DrScheme 
    first for your platform 
 
 that's just Web-page boilerplate that appears regardless 
 of whether you've installed DrScheme or not.  Or did you 
 mean something else?

 John,

 After you download MrSpidey, you should have a file "mrspidey.plt".
 In your plt directory, there should be a file "Setup PLT.exe".
 Run
 
 	"Setup PLT.exe" mrspidey.plt
 
 Then, the next time you run DrScheme, you should see a button
 called "Analyze".  Just click on the button to invoke MrSpidey
 on any program you've loaded into DrScheme.

 In Help Desk, enter "define-macro".  That gives help on the
 macro system in DrScheme.
 
 I've attached a file that implements record support for EOPL.

 Thanks, I'll pass on this info.
