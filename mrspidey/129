Spidey currently doesn't boot.  Create a trivial file, save,
start spidey, and I get:

  #<procedure>: expects 3 arguments, given 2: st:const-merge-size 7

State-Changed-Why:

mred:set-preference-default has changed -- it now takes a third argument
specifing weather a preference read off the disk is legitimate or not. I
supplied (lambda (x) #t) for all of the spidey preferences. Someone should
go back and put meaningful functions in there.

Also, I deleted PLTHOME/mrspidey/Gui/loadu.zo. So, maybe, Cormac, if you
read you email you can tell me how to remake it?
