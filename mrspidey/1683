INSTALLATION FAILED

and now when I click on the analyze button,
I get an internal error error (which I can't seem to copy
under Windows).  On the standard output is what I think is
the same error message:

>How-To-Repeat:

I clicked on the analyze icon to get the second.

 Your bug report suggests you're using DrScheme 102.
 The version of MrSpidey must match the version of DrScheme.
 I'm guessing you downloaded the 103 version of MrSpidey,
 which won't work.

 Paul,
 
 Ah, I see, thanks.  I guess I shouldn't wait a few weeks between
 downloading and installing... :-)
