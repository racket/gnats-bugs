     MrSpidey shows new information only after moving with scroll bar
 
 
 A similar phenomenon occurs with value sets.  However, it doesn't 
 happen when the Spidey window is first opened.  Apparently, some
 state gets messed up, and then these problems occur.

 These problems don't occur for arbitrary files.  
 
 If you can identify a file and expression for which they
 occur, that would help locate the problem.
