>Description:
When trying to analyze a CGI program I got the following error 
printed to the REPL:

ivar/proc: expects type <object> as 1st argument, given: #f; other arguments were: get-dc
Exception handler did not escape
exception handler did not escape

I have sent the code to Steckler, so he can attach it
if necessary.

 Where is the code that triggers this error?
 
 The CGI script that triggered the "more than once" 
 error doesn't give this behavior here.

 Paul,
 
 Turns out the bug was in something completely different.  Please close 
 the PR.  Thanks.
