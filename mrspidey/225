>Description:
	spidey report (error 'foo "foo" x) as a parent of some other
	occurrence of x
	ditto for

		 [(foo? x) ...]
		)
	The x in the conditional is reported as the direct parent of an
	occurrence of x (for non-side-effecting function foo?). 
>How-To-Repeat:
	Ask Tim to analyze cek.ss and chase context-empty? (occurrence of
	context filter num)

State-Changed-Why:

Tim Miller reports that the bug does not exist with his current code.  Therefore,
it's not clear how to reproduce the bug, if it's still there.

steck> Can you send me a piece of code which tickles the bug (cek.ss)?

tim> Sorry, I don't seem to have that version of the code any more, and the version 
I have doesn't show the bug.

Tim
