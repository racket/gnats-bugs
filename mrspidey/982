>Description:
	Analyze the following program: 
	(define empty? null?)

	(define (f x)
	  (cond
	    ((empty? x) 0)
	    (else (first x))))

	(f (type: (listof num)))

        When spidey window shows up, make it small so that the top window
        does not display the (first x) expression. 

 	Then click on hyperlink in bottom window. Nothing happens. It
 	should make (first x) visible. 

>How-To-Repeat:
	The above is a small version of a larger program in which I
	encountered this first.
