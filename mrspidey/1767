>Description:
This may superseded the bug report on filter. 

Spidey analyzes the require-library and chases down 
the entire chain of required libraries. But as the 
following excerpt shows, it doesnt assign types to 
the functions and values from these libraries. 

Argh!


(require-library "xml.ss" "xml")

;; read-course : string -> X-expr
;; to read a course file (c) as an X-expr, enforce checks 
(define (read-course c)
  (xml->xexpr.
   ((eliminate-whitespace (list 'course 'prereq) identity).
    (document-element (with-input-from-file c. read-xml.)).)))

(read-course "312.xml")
