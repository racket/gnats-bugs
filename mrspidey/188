 I can't reproduce this, even after adding back in the error.

 This one persists.

 	   7. TAB jumps over red prims occasionally
 seems to be okay.
 is this an nt vs unix problem?

Responsible-Changed-Why:

  	   1. (define-type foo (new sym)) correctly signals an error
 		   but doesn't provide a location

Intended behavior. 

 	   2. child, parent, path-to for some function definitions
 		   (define (Fparser field) ...)
 	   don't work; 
 
 I can't reproduce this, even after adding back in the error. 
 
 	   for others they give SEQUENTIAL arrows 
 	   instead of parallel ones

An unfortunate consequence of the constraint derivation algorithms for
if-splitting and flow-sensitivity. The next generation of MrSpidey
should be careful about this.
 
 	   3. (reference "file") doesn't seem to trigger the famed 
 	   componential constraint analysis system :)

And was never meant to. Use reference-unit!

 	   4. in the constraint, aiclasses doesn't have a source

Because its source is in types.ss, which is referenced using
"reference", and MrSpidey doesn't do inter-file arrows in such cases.
 
 	   TURN-ON ACCURATE CONSTANT ANALYSIS: 
 	   5. when -> is used as a symbol, Spidey thinks it is the arrow
 	   type

An unfortunate consequence of the design decision to internally
manipulate types expressions as sexps, not as ASTs.

 	   6. (cond [(eq? tag 'as) ...1...]) doesn't seem to do
 	   anything for accurate symbol tracking (otherwise we 
 	   could do really well in 311) Pleeeeaaaaaaaase!

The proof system isn't strong enough :-(

 	   7. TAB jumps over red prims occasionally
 seems to be okay.
