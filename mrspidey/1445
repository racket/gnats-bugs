>Description:
Spidey infers x to be nil in the first cond
clause although it's proetcted by a check 

When you fix the type to replace nil by mumber
+ is still red and it shouldn't be

;; f : tree[number] -> number
;; to compute the sum of x
(define (f x)
  (cond
    [(pair? x) (+ (f (car x)) (f (cdr x)))]
    [else x]))

(define-type tree
  (union nil (cons tree tree)))

(f (type: tree))

 this is because if splitting was off. So, that is not a real problem.

 this bug seems to be real, tho.
 
 Note that if splitting was still off. So, this might really be a 
 problem with the type display of the arguments to +.

 Yes, Spidey shouldn't do any analysis when it finds syntax mistakes in type
 specs. Whatever it finds is useless. -- Matthias
