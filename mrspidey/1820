>Description:
The hashtable in the following program contains sym/sym pairs only. 
Spidey still marks all prim apps as green. Indeed, it even shows
that we're trying to look up a string key in a sym hashtable. 
We should produce a red application for this. (Proposal?)

(define x (make-hash-table))

(hash-table-put! x 'wow 'dang)

(hash-table-get x 'wow)

(hash-table-get. x "wow")
