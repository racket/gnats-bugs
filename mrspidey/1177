 	and all you get is a single edge not a complete path
 
 I really need a concrete example with desired behavior and actual 
 behavior to know what's going on here.  Also, a comparison with 
 53 would help isolate the problem.

 No problem: use ~matthias/Web/311/spidey-test.ss 
 analyze it. Look at a use of the parameter in parser and 
 try to find the source. Instead of giving you a PATH 
 it draws a SINGLE EDGE into the Spidey window.
