>Description:
Opening the analyzer on any buffer resets the fonts on other Scheme buffers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Open a Scheme file in DrScheme and select "analsyis". Be sure that
the default font (used when opening a non-Scheme file) and the Scheme
font (modern) are different to make the effect visually obvious.
>Fix:
Perhaps MrSpidey is creating a Scheme buffer and resetting the content
of the style list? As I recall, DrScheme now uses a single style list
for all Scheme buffers.
