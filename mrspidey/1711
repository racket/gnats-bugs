>Description:
case-lambda's aren't checked for unreachable code, but 
could be.

For example, if you have two clauses with the identical
number of arguments, the second clause is unreachable.

Also, if you have a 'rest' argument, that can make 
subsequent clauses unreachable.

We could make it a condition of syntactic well-formedness
that all clauses are reachable.

An algorithm to do this is, I think:

 - assign a lower and upper bound for the number of arguments
    for each clause (the upper bound will be \inf for rest args)
 - if the interval for any clause is contained in the interval for
    any preceding clause, the clause is unreachable

Maybe such a check would violate Schemeliness, but I think
it might prevent some errors.

Or maybe this sort of thing belongs in Spidey2.

Just a thought.

 For what it's worth, your proposed optimization would change the 
 semantics of MzScheme w.r.t. syntactic errors. If you care.

 Actually, you need to combine the intervals from preceding
 clauses.
