>Description:
	create a file with a definition 
	insert an image at the top of the file (inside of a text box)
	put ";" in front of it 

	then run Spidey 
	while it runs Zodiac it signals something about unquote outside of quasi
	
	now delete the image
	Spidey's zodiac is likely to complain about a perfectly legitimate 
	construct

	now save-definitions-as-text -- you may be saved or not

	I know that this is not a great bug report ... don't bother to complain

 If you put the image inside a block comment delimited
 by |# and #|, Spidey won't balk at the syntax.
 
 Of course, the results in the Spidey window look like
 nonsense :-)
