>Description:
I checked this program on Thurs and Spidey correctly annotated 

(require-library "macro.ss")
(require-library "functio.ss")
(require-library "xml.ss" "xml")

(define (course-title x)
  (second (assq 'title x).))

This should clearly turn second red. But it is BLACK. 
Argh ..

 Oops never mind. I am getting old. SECOND isn't primitive.
 Spidey still sucks.
