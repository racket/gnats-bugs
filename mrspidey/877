I have downloaded mrspidey.exe and mrspidey.ps and put them in c:\program files\plt\
When click mrspidey.exe anything happens.  When click mrspidey.ps, it requires winword.exe.
But, after I specify the winword.exe path to request, I just get a unreadable Word file opened.

1 download
2 move the two file in c:\program file\plt\
3 click one of them at a time.

 That's because you need the Ghostview program to view the file.  You
 need to download Ghostview; you can find it at
 
   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
 
 You need to double-click on the .exe, not on the .ps, to install
 MrSpidey.  (I believe that is what our documentation says.)

 Where did you get "mrspidey.exe"? The MrSpidey download page provides
 "mrspidey.plt", not "mrspidey.exe". "Mrspidey.plt" is a file that
 should be dragged onto "Setup PLT" in the plt folder. Then, when you
 start DrScheme, it will contain a "MrSpidey" button.
 
 Unfortunately, I don't know how to print PostScript (.ps) files under
 Windows. Is winword.exe supposed to handle PostScript? If all else
 fails, consider downloading the documentation in HTML format.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
