>Description:
Use MrSpidey to analyze code in a separate file (using the
fixed Zodiac, soon to be committed).  Make sure there is a
bug in the separate file.  Click on the check.  you get

message-box: expects argument of type <frame% or dialog% object
or #f>; given (ok)

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a collection PLTCOLLECTS/foo/bar.ss which contains

(printf "in foo/bar.ss~n")
(car 1)

Create a file containing

(require-library "bar.ss" "foo")

Analyze.  You get a check on the car in bar.ss.  Click on
the link.  You get the above error.
