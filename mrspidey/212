>Description:
	
Spidey fails to start up.
After entering (+ 1 2), saving to file, and trying to start spidey,
I get a bunch of:

% drscheme -x
ivar: instance variable lock-status-changed not found in class derived from #<class:wx:frame%>
ivar: instance variable keymap not found in class derived from #<class:wx:frame%>
ivar: instance variable keymap not found in class derived from #<class:wx:frame%>
ivar: instance variable keymap not found in class derived from #<class:wx:frame%>

Perhaps this is the same problem as PR 207 (preferences)?
