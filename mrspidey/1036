 When I tried this example with 53, it also failed there.
 
 The problem appears to be that the type ENV is undefined.
 Giving a definition for ENV, such as
 
        (define-struct env (vars vals))
        (define-type ENV (structure:env (listof sym) (listof num)))
 
 makes the example work under both 53 and 100alpha3.

 I will check again but I did this in v53 on my laptop.

 Yes, you're correct. I had misconstructed the bug. 
 
 On further inspection I discovered that it had misspelled 
 
    (reference-file "grammar.ss")
 
 in the original file and I had misunderstood the message. 
 In my hurry to get a bug report out, I made a mistake. 
 
 Please close the report. Thanks.
