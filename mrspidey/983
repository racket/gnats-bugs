 	Spidey's summary interface doesn't react to tabbing
 	TAB used to take you from the current bug to the next 
 
 With the program
 
      (+ #f 3)
      (* #f 42)
 
 both TAB and Shift-TAB move the cursor between + and * in
 the program (upper) window.  The same behavior occurs in v. 53.
 Tabbing in the summary window does nothing, as in v. 53.
