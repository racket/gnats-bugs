        The MrSpidey preferences panel wasn't ported to 100. When
        I click on a radio button, I get an error involving 
        get-command-int, a method of a control event that no longer exists.
 
 I fixed this and other bugs in the preferences a few days ago.
 The preferences should work in x-drscheme.
