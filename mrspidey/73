>Description:
	
The following names are known to drscheme (without asking for any
libraries), but are unknown to Spidey.  Thus, for exammple, 
(car (current-process-milliseconds)) is green, even though 
it always gives an error.

Some of the choices are curious.  For example, Spidey knows
current-milliseconds, but not current-process-milliseconds.  
It knows relative-path?, but not absolute-path?, and so on.

Don't treat this as an exhaustive list.  It's just a random sample
of names that I happened to stumble on.  Plus, eri is acting up,
so I can't get a more complete list.

  current-process-milliseconds
  current-gc-milliseconds
  file-or-directory-permissions
  absolute-path?
  complete-path?
  path->complete-path
  file-or-directory-permissions
  current-drive
  tcp-listen
  tcp-connect
  tcp-accept
  tcp-accept-ready?
  tcp-closer
  tcp-listener?
  tcp-port-send-waiting?
  seconds->date
  system*
  execute
  execute*
  make-will-executor
  will-executor?
  will-executor-try
  dump-memory-stats

I've gone thru the MzScheme manual, and added all of the primitives that I believe MrSpidey should/can handle.
