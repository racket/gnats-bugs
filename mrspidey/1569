>Description:
Analyze the following program: 

(define x 0)

(begin0
  x
  (set! x (add1 x)))

The analysis window won't turn the sub-expressions of 
begin0 into things that come with analysis results. 

Note: I actually believe that MrSpidey analyzes begin0
incorrectly but I don't have evidence for that.
