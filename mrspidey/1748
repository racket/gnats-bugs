 Unlike map, which is R5RS, filter is in MzLib/functio.ss.
 
 Does your program use require-library on that file?

 Hmmm, I wrote a program with 
 
       (require-library "functio.ss")
 
 but nothing flowed through filter.  The definition 
 is clearly there, since Spidey does not complain
 about an unbound identifier.
 
 Still, adding filter to the primitives list 
 is not the right strategy to fix this.

 I know that filter is in functio. I tested it too: 
 
 (require-library "functio.ss")
 
 ;; directories : -> (listof str)
 (define (count-directories) 
   (filter directory-exists? (directory-list)(listof str)))
 
 (count-directories) :: (union nil (listof str) (cons str (listof str)))
 
 The application of filter does NOT show an outflow. I don't know why. 
 The application of count-directories does, and it's correct (though
 strange).

 Isn't filter a mzlib function?
