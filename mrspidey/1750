Analyze the program below:

(require-library "refer.ss")

(invoke-unit/sig 
 (compound-unit/sig

   (link 
    [F : mzlib:function^ ((require-library-unit/sig "functior.ss"))]
    [M : (directories) ((require-unit/sig "spidey-test1a.ss") F)])
   (export)))

get weird error message on lazy unit being linked more than once. 

>How-To-Repeat:
spidey-test1a.ss

(unit/sig (directories)
  (import mzlib:function^)
  
  ;; directories : -> (listof str)
  (define (directories) 
    (filter directory-exists? (directory-list)))
  
  (directories))

 I believe this message has been removed.
