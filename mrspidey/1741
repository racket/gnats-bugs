>Description:
Analyze this program:

(define (output-headers out code message seconds mime extras)
  (for-each (lambda (line)
              (for-each (lambda (word) (display word out)) line)
              )
            (list* `("HTTP/1.1 " ,code " " ,message)
                   extras))
  ) 

The last occurrence of "line" in the third line is inferred to be
a string. But list* produces lists only. What's going on?

 This program:
 
    (list* 'a '())
 
 also demonstrates the problem. This evaluates to '(a), but spidey is 
 missing the list around the symbol. Just in case someone in the 
 audience isn't familiar with list*, it is like a multi-cons. Here's 
 what list* does:
 
    (list* a b c d e ... z) =
    (cons a (cons b (cons c (cons d (cons e (cons .... z))))))
 
 Perhaps there isn't a good way to write that in spidey's notation, 
 since the distinguished argument is the _last_ one. That might be why 
 the approximation is so bad.
 
 This program:
 
 (define (output-headers out code message seconds mime extras)
    (for-each (lambda (line)
                (for-each (lambda (word) (display word out)) line)
                )
              (cons `("HTTP/1.1 " ,code " " ,message)
                     extras))
    )
 
 analyzes just fine.
 
 HTH,
