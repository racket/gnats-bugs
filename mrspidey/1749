>Description:
Analyze the following one-line program: 

  (require-library "xml.ss" "xml")

You get the following warnings: 

Warning: Free variable current-continuation-marks
Warning: Free variable make-exn:application:mismatch
Warning: Free variable #%check-parameter-procedure
Warning: Free variable not-break-exn?
Warning: Free variable procedure-arity-includes?
Warning: Free variable raise-type-error
Warning: Free variable make-parameter
Warning: Free variable make-parameter
Warning: Free variable make-parameter

each of these things were added recently
let's extend spidey so we don't get this
stuff

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed

State-Changed-When: Tue Nov  7 18:20:52 2000
State-Changed-Why:
All fixed, except  

	Warning: Free variable make-exn:application:mismatch

This should follow from a structure definition, which may
be missing.  In other words, I'd guess Spidey's complaint
is legitimate.

 Yes.  That was the point of my message: Spidey now handles all the 
 variables mentioned *except* that one.
