>Description:

Type in this in Def window 
Click execute (will generate an error)
Then click on Analyze
Analysis gets stuck as follows: 

    ===========================================
    Reading    bi.ss:                 32       240ms
    Initializing language                      550ms
    Analyzing  bi.ss:                 12       190ms

and then something HUGE is printed in the xterm where you fired up
DrScheme. (Spidey used to analyze classes just fine. I don't have access to
53 so I don't know what's happening here.) 

define point%
  (class object% (x0 y0)
    (sequence (super-init))
    (private)
    (public 
      [x x0]
      [y y0]
      [equal (lambda (another-point)
               (and (eq? (ivar another-point x) x)
                    (eq? (ivar another-point y) y)))])))

(define color-point%
  (class point% (x0 y0 c0)
    (sequence (super-init x0 y0))
    (private)
    (rename 
      [super-equal equal])
    (public 
      [color c0])
    (override
      [equal (lambda (another-point)
               (and (super-equal another-point)
                    (eq? (ivar another-point color) color)))])))

(define p (make-object point% 12 1))
(define q (make-object point% 12 1))

(define cp (make-object color-point% 12 1 'red))

(send p equal cp)

(send cp equal p)

>How-To-Repeat:
	
>Fix:
Changes to traverse.ss,checks.ss,zod-aux.ss, and language.ss
