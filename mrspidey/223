 It's more problems with the edit hierarchy re-arrangement. Probably you
 embedded edits are some class, that doesn't have find-string-embedded in
 it. `find-string-embedded' is defined in
 mred:searching-edit%. Unfortunately, mred:searching-edit% is a descendant
 of mred:info-edit%, which is wrong. It should be the other way around. I
 will fix it and release, and you can then change your embedded edits to
 mred:searching-edit%'s. Make sense?
