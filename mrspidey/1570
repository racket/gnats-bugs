>Description:
Type in the following two definitions: 

(define object% (type: num))

(define queue% (class* object% () () (public [Q '()])))

Analyze. 

Amazing result: MrSpidey doesn't complain that the superclass 
expression of the queue% definition contains num as the type. 

If you replace (type: num) with 5, it happily says (const 5)
is the value of the superclass and that's that. 

MrSpidey should turn the class parens red.
