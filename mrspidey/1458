	Please add the following things to Spidey's language.ss repertoire

	first 
	rest
	empty

  -- the following must be done so that if-splitting works (i.e. as
	"constructor checks" or whatever they are called)

	empty? 
	symbol=? 
	boolean=? 
	
	Please also check in the beginner functionality specification for 
	non-standard Scheme functions that I have overlooked.
