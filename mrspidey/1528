>Description:
When Zodiac signals a static error, MrSpidey
does not print the error and stop the
computation.  Instead, it prints output such as

MrSpidey error: Syntax error: <actual error>

and then *allows the computation to continue*.
This violates Zodiac's invariant that 
calls to static-error will not return,
which can lead to all sorts of unpredictable
behavior (see, for example, PR 1497).

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file containing

(lambda 3)

and process it with Spidey.  Spidey
will print

MrSpidey error: Syntax error: lambda: 
  malformed expression at ...

but will continue to compute, even popping up
a window with the result of the "analysis".
