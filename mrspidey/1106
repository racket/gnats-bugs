State-Changed-When: Tue Sep 14 18:13:39 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed, at least as far as program text goes.  The 
type annotations still have fixed size.  People 
may want to try displaying type annotations 
to see if the alignment changes are acceptable.

State-Changed-Why:
Matthew thinks type annotations should have 
variable fonts.

State-Changed-Why:
Type annotations now have variable fonts.  Please check 
that this works acceptably.
