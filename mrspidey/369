 Sorry, I don't understand exactly what your bug report is.  If you're
 saying it takes a long time to load, this is because it is a large
 package; it takes the same amount of time whether or not you have a
 program in your buffer.  Subsequent uses do not involve this
 load-time.
 
 I hope this suitably addresses your bug report.
