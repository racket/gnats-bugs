>Description:
	Somehow this use of match messes up when you analyze the program
below, but it check syntaxes and executes fine.

Also, in analyze, if you remove the last macro application, it analyzes
fine which is strance, since the two macros should be equivalent.

>How-To-Repeat:
(reference-library "match.ss")
(define-macro m
  (lambda x
    (match x
      [x `(apply ,@x)])))

(define-macro n
  (lambda x
    `(apply ,@x)))

(n + 1 (list 2))

(m + 1 (list 2))

expansion code
