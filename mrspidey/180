	It contains one function annotated with (polymorphism ...)
	After "analyze" Spidey does 
		not assign a vald type schema (it says (empty -> false))
		produces mixed-up results at the two application sites
		cannot find one of the two application sites of the
			function with "parents"

	analyze above file

State-Changed-Why:

The definition

(define assp 
  (polymorphic
   (lambda (prop struct*)
    (cond
      ((null? struct*) #f)
      (else (if (prop (car struct*)) (car struct*) (assp prop (cdr struct*))))))))

should be

(define assp 
  (polymorphic
    (letrec
      ([assp
         (lambda (prop struct*)
           (cond
             ((null? struct*) #f)
             (else (if (prop (car struct*)) (car struct*) (assp prop (cdr struct*))))))])
      assp)))

so that the recursive reference to assp is also polymorphic.
