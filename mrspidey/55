>Description:
1. There is no easy way of getting rid of "MrSpidey Progress" window
(like a button to click).

2. Shouldn't it be called "Static Debugger Progress"?

3. I created a file that contained (define x 3) followed by a (single)
newline.  The Spidey window that came up with the analysis (also
called "MrSpidey: <filename>") had numerous blank lines after it, and
had the code indented by a few spaces.  There is no clear reason for
either of these.

4. Further, I am able to edit all these and mess around with the code
that is present.

1. There is now a hide button
2. (yawn)
3. The initial spaces and following blank lines are 
   there for technical reasons.
4. The MrSpidey window is not un-editable.
