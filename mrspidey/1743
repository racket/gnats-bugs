Spidey doesn't know about unit/sig? 

When you add it, please make sure it becomes an

 Apparently it already does.  Spidey has no problem with:
 
     (define-signature foo^
       (blah))
 
       (unit/sig foo^
         (import)
 	(define blah 42))

 Because unit/sig elaborates to a Zodiac form, Spidey
 does not treat it as a primitive.  Instead, it 
 appears to be handled during parsing.

State-Changed-When: Mon Nov  6 17:13:27 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Added.  Can't really make it if-splitting, because 
there's no ordinary type associated with unit/sig.
Instead, the types have signature info.
