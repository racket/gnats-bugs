>Description:
If you put empty? inside a unit, Spidey
complains with a Syntax Error message.

It does analyze the use of empty? correctly,
however.

This result does not depend on the 
Language Level of DrScheme.

My guess is it's a problem with the
Spidey vocabular in Zodiac.

>How-To-Repeat:
(unit
  (import)
  (export)
  (empty? '(a b c)))

Analyze this!

 Quoting steck@cs.rice.edu:

 Because `empty?' is not a built-in function for units. (Not a problem
 with Zodiac, as least as things are currently defined.)

 empty? is a procedure, not a syntactic form.  Therefore, it has
 nothing to do with Zodiac.  The unit parser accepts as primitive
 whatever MzScheme says is primitive.
 
 Spidey has never handled language levels.  It probably has empty?,
 first, rest, etc in its type descriptors, added on Matthias's demand,
 and will analyze empty? even if MzScheme's corresponding namespace
 does not recognize the name.  In short, Spidey knows nothing about
 language levels, and empty? is a language-level-ism.
 
 So the problem is much bigger than this PR, and the correct fix to
 this problem is to make Spidey level-sensitive.  For instance, it
 should enforce list-in-cdr-position for cons at lower levels.

 Yep, I closed the PR.

 Absolutely. Close the PR, it's useless as such.

 Well, the PR has nothing to do with me -- if anything, it's a bug
 report to the maintainer of Spidey, so Paul should close it or do
 whatever else he deems fit.
