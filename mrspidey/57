>Description:
	
Sometimes Spidey's "Show" menu gets into the wrong state.

>How-To-Repeat:
	
Start drscheme.
Enter a trivial program that has at least one check, eg: (car 4).
Save to file.
Start Spidey.
Spidey window appears with both program and checks subwindows.
Pull down "Show" menu.

The window's state is actually "both", but the menu says "Program Only".
Furthermore, clicking on "Program Only" has no effect (I guess because
it thinks it's already in that state).

>Fix:
	
Easily worked around, just use Show menu twice (but still looks bad).
