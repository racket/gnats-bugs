>Description:
Spidey still assigns the wrong type to read-string 

  (read-string (string->number (cdr len)). in.)
(rec
 ((y1 (box (union atom y1 y2 y3)))
  (y2 (cons (union atom y1 y2 y3) (union atom y1 y2 y3)))
  (y3 (vec (union atom y1 y2 y3))))
 (union atom y3 y2 y1))

read-string should produce string or eof. 

CVS'ed today!
