	wxWindows Error: Warning: cannot allocate colour, using approximate match.
      (Future allocations may be approximate without report.)

      ivar: instance variable edit-position-changed not found in class derived from #<class:wx:frame%>

     from #<class:wx:frame%>

State-Changed-Why:

The problem was due to changes in mred, which I accomodated last
night, but due to other problems in ~mflatt/plt/mred, I couldn't
release until this morning. The above behavior no longer occurs.
