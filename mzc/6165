State-Changed-Why:
    The error is not as clear as it should be,and I've improved it.
    
    The problem is that mzc is looking for a C compiler,
    such as cl.exe, and it can't find one. If you meant to
    compile Scheme code to an extension using a C compiler,
    you'll need to make sure it's in your PATH. For MSVC,
    i think there's a vcvars32.bat script that adds the variables,
    though I may misremember the name of the script.
    
    --ico isn't actually used in this mode. It's only
    for creating stand-alone executables with --exe
    or --gui-exe (and that mode doesn't need a C
    compiler).
