>Description:
see example program

(This bug is probably not worth fixing, since no
 one is likely to use mzc anymore.
 For the record, though, the problem is
 in the A-normalization pass, which essentially
 transforms `let' into ` let*'.)
>How-To-Repeat:
      (let ([count 0])
        (let ([first-time? #t]
              [k (call/cc values)])
          (if first-time?
              (begin
                (set! first-time? #f)
                (set! count (+ count 1))
                (k values))))
        count) ; => 1, should be 2

 When you say "no one uses mzc", you're talking about the c compilation
 part of the swiss army knife?
