>Description:
I have a medium-sized program (37000 lines of Scheme code).
I compile it as a unit as described in the mzc manual on
page 3 and 4 (BTW: does the invoke-unit call really belong to the
program that is to be compiled?)
Under 101 everything is fine.
Now, under 102, mzc 'hammers' on my disk when [emitting ANSI C]
is reached and emits lines containing
only struct mergedStructs... definitions.
After some minutes, I stop the mzc process in order to protect
my harddisk (no, there is no swapping going on.)
(his is true for the binary distribution and the source
distribution for Solaris.

 Just wanted to let you know that it may be another week before I get a
 chance to work on this. I hope 101 works ok for you in the meantime.

 I haven't been able to reproduce the problem. Would it be possible for
 you send me some example code?
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew
