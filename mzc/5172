>Description:
The result of c-lambda cannot be used in function position.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following :
  ((c-lambda (int) int "___result = 1 + ___arg1;") 4)
produces the error:
  c-lambda-procedure: c-lambda not compiled by mzc
when compiled and load-extension'd.

The code:
  (apply (c-lambda (int) int "___result = 1 + ___arg1;") '(4))
works fine.
