>Description:
A program that defines SchemeUnit test cases can't be compiled to native code with mzc: it produces an invalid C file.
>How-To-Repeat:
(I'm using v203 in Windows 2000 professional, with the "Textual (MzScheme, includes R5RS)" language with case sensitivity turned on.)

Make sure SchemeUnit is installed. Create a file called "adder.ss" with the following source:

;; ================================================
(module adder mzscheme
(require (lib "test.ss" "schemeunit"))
(define (add x y) (+ x y))
(define adder-tests
  (make-test-suite
   "Adder tests"
   (make-test-case
    "one plus one is two"
    (assert = (add 1 1) 2))
   (make-test-case
    "one plus zero is one"
    (assert = (add 1 0) 1))))
(provide add adder-tests))
;; ================================================

Save the file. (You can run it in DrScheme to verify that it runs correctly.) From the command line, type 'mzc adder.ss' and it will fail to compile. (Use 'mzc --save-temps adder.ss' to look at the generated C file.)

If you need any more info, such as the generated C file, let me know.

Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
