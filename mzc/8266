>Description:
When one (presumably by mistake) supplies a non-existant filename as an argument to mzc -k, mzc's output indicates that the file was compiled successfully.  It'd be nice to get a file-not-found error.  (I encountered this when I was compiling a file but was in the wrong directory by mistake.  It looked like compilation succeeded, as demonstrated below, so I was very surprised when I tried to run the program and got an unbound-variable error.)
>How-To-Repeat:
[vetinari:~]$ mzc -k this-file-does-not-exist.ss
mzc version 352.5, Copyright (c) 2004-2006 PLT Scheme Inc.
"this-file-does-not-exist.ss":
 [already up-to-date at "./compiled/this-file-does-not-exist.zo"]

(In this case, not only does this-file-does-not-exist.ss not exist, but the compiled subdirectory doesn't even exist!)

>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Thu, 26 Oct 2006 00:58:33 -0400
Reason>>> fixed (a while back)
