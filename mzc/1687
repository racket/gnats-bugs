>Description:
I am attempting to port som code from scsh to mzscheme.
The scsh reader always distinguishes upper vs lower case.
mzscheme -g distinguishes upper vs lower case.

But if I compile to .zo with mzc, the symbols in the program are
all converted to lower case.  This creates some problems for me:
I am doing some data processing on input stored as an S-expression.
(let* ((filename (vector-ref argv 0))
	   ;; read data created by procStats
	   (data (with-input-from-file filename
		   (lambda () (read))))
      ...
The input S expression has embedded non-double-quoted file names
so I need the -g switch of mzscheme to reference the correct files.

mzscheme -mfv procStats2_mz.zo -e '(main)' -- foo
changes my filenames to lower case, but otherwise works.

mzscheme -mfgv procStats2_mz.zo -e '(main)' -- foo
produces some output, then crashes with:
cdr: expects argument of type <pair>; given ()

mzscheme -mfgv procStats2_mz.ss -e '(main)' -- foo
works -- but as the switch from scsh to mzscheme was to attempt
to speed up program execution, I would rather be using .zo than
.ss files.

(and no: there is no "Cdr" or any such in the source program).

>How-To-Repeat:
If the problem isn't obvious, mail me asking for
code and data files in types.bu.edu:~/mzscheme-bug
I don't see a way to attach files to the bug report form.

 One solution is to use a "prefix" file for compiling that puts the
 reader in case-senstive mode:
 
 casesens.scm:
  (read-case-sensitive #t)
 
 compile:
   mzc -p casesens.scm -z myfile.scm
 
 Not a great solution, but it should work.
