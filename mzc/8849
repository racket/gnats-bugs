Hello,
when trying to install DrScheme (370 or 370.7) make gives an error:

make: Failed to make compiled/gl-info.zo; link-extension: can't find an installed linker

This occurs only on Linux. The same environment (gcc 4.1.1, ld 2.17)
on Solaris works fine.

Is there a solution or workaround ?

Regards.
Martin Preen

 Do you have GCC installed in some non standard way?  Matthew: I
 thought that gcc is always used, no?

 Can you check whether `cc' is available on your Linux machine? If not,
 then linking `cc' to `gcc' is a workaround, and we'll fix the problem.
 
 Thanks,
 Matthew

 Yes --- I was puzzled, because the `gcc' was found for the compile step
 and not the link step.
 
 But it turns out that the compiler looks for `cc' or `gcc', while the
 linker looks only for `cc'. So, my guess is that `gcc' is found, and
 `cc' isn't.
 
 (Under Solaris, `ld' is used directly for linking, so it doesn't matter
 whether `cc' is available there.)

Reason>>> Changed dynext linker search to try `gcc' then `cc',
instead of just `cc' (which makes it like the dynext
compiler search)

 The cc-link worked fine.
 
 Thanks.
