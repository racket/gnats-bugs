>Description:
Hi, just reporting this because the compiler told me to.  I was trying to build native code versions of all the code in my collects/ dir.  The file cm-accomplice.ss compiles in byte code mode but when trying to compile native code (on Mac Os X Jaguar 10.3.3), I get the below compiler error.  

MzScheme compiler (mzc) version 206p1, Copyright (c) 2004 PLT Scheme, Inc.
"cm-accomplice.ss": 
 [?,?]: INTERNAL ERROR: vm->c:convert-type-definition: #f not a valid representation
 please report the bug at http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/Bugs/
  (or, as a last resort, send mail to plt-bugs@cs.rice.edu)
  and include a transcript in verbose mode
Errors encountered.  Compilation aborted.
