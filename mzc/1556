Invokation of mzc:

c:\"Program Files"\plt\mzc.exe --compiler "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\bin\cl.exe" -d "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include" "C:\My Documents\Scheme\snakes\snakes\blackmamba.scm" 

result:

MzScheme compiler (mzc) version 101, Copyright (c) 1996-99 PLT
"C:\My Documents\Scheme\snakes\snakes\blackmamba.scm": 
 [?,?]: Error:  C compiler did not complete successfully
compile-extension:

Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 12.00.8168 for 80x86

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include\blackmamba.c(657) : error C2229: struct '__unnamed' has an illegal zero-sized array

workaround:

/* compiler written static variables */
static struct {
  /* Write fields as an array to help C comiplers */
  /* that don't like really big records. */
  Scheme_Object * _consts_[0];
  Scheme_Object * lifted531;

tweaked to:

/* compiler written static variables */
static struct {

  Scheme_Object * _consts_[53];
  Scheme_Object * lifted531;
  Scheme_Object * lifted530;
  Scheme_Object * lifted529;
} S;

which then produces object code, that I can't get to load in Dr. Scheme using:

(load/use-compiled 
"C:\\My Documents\\Scheme\\snakes\\snakes\\blackmamba.obj")

I can send a copy of my tournament winning snake code (blackmamba.scm) but there seems to be no way to do attachments in this submittal form.



>How-To-Repeat:
Compile blackmamba.scm (can be sent as an attachment upon request) using mzc (which for me was cruel and unusual punishment in MSDOS, but I think we did it right, as far as I can tell).

 This bug is fixed in 102. 
 
 (102 has not been announced, but is actually available at
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/102/drscheme/
 Beware: we're still in the final phase of testing.)
 
 If you want to patch 101, edit plt/collects/compiler/vm2c.ss and change
 `emit-static-variable-fields!' to start as follows:
 
  (define (emit-static-variable-fields! port l)
    (unless (null? l)
      ...

 DrScheme needs a .dll file. Modulo extra paths provided to mzc,
 
   mzc --ld blackmamba.dll blackmamba.obj
 
 should do the trick.
 
 Then, either use `load-extension' to load "blackmamba.dll", or put
 "blackmamba.dll" in a win32/i386/ subdirectory and use
 `load/use-compiled' with the original .scm name.

 I'm very grateful for your fast response to my bug report and will
 cheerfully help beta test 102.
 
 I have more confidence in Rice development products being solid than I do in
 Windows and Microsoft products themselves!
 
 Thanks.

 Thanks--I've downloaded 102 and I'm still having a devil of a time with
 pathnames.
 
 Under Win 98 you can't specify the path variable the way you can in Win NT.
 (In NT you can go to system -> environment and set the PATH variable.)
 
 I keep getting errors that the compilation process can't find stdio.h.
 
 Here is my batch file for compiling:
 
 c:\"Program Files"\plt\mzc.exe --compiler "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
 Studio\VC98\bin\cl.exe" -d "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
 Studio\VC98\Include" "C:\My Documents\Scheme\snakes\snakes\whitefang.scm"
 
 How do I tell it where the stdio.h file is (seeing how the -d option isn't
 doing it)???
 
 Is there some other interface to mzc besides MSDOS (and/or the GNU system)?

 When you installed MSVC, it should have created a batch file,
 vcvars32.bat, which sets all the appropriate environment variables.
 
 For me, it worked best to copy the contents of that file into my
 autoexec.bat.

 Yeah, I already tried that:  when I run that file as is, I get "out of
 environment space" messages.
 
 Maybe there's something different that needs to be done under Win 98.  I'll
 have to research that in MSDN or have a C++ programmer look at it--I'm not
 much of a DOS hacker.

 Now that you remind me, I think that's the problem I had when running
 the .bat file directly. If I remember correctly, simply copying the
 file's content to autoexec.bat worked ok.

 When I finally get this working (and I will--even if I have to do the entire
 MCSD certification programs for VC++ and MCSE before I finally figure it
 out! =:0) perhaps you could note y/our experiences in PLT documentation so
 others might be spared this frustration.
 
 I know it's ugly quirkology that is not the fault of PLT software;
 nonetheless it's part of the reality of using PLT software.
 
 When I try to run vcvars32.bat on my NT machine at work, it runs fine
 (whether I run it from an MSDOS prompt or by double clicking on it from
 Windows Explorer).
 
 I will try what you suggest on my Win 98 home machine after work and let you
 know if that does the trick for me too (hopefully!).
 
 Thanks for all your help, without which I'd be lost!

 That's certainly true. I'll expand the docs, and try to keep this kind
 of documentation in mind in the future.

 Your (autoexec) trick worked like a champ.  As I mentioned before, this
 wasn't necessary on my NT machine at work; but on my Win 98 home machine, I
 was getting "out of environment space" until I appended the contents of
 vcvars32.bat into autoexec.bat and rebooted.
 
 mzc compilation now works and the compiled code works like a champ in Dr.
 Scheme version 102.  (Looks like it runs so fast I might not need to bother
 with C++! =:0)  This is really cool technology!!!  I'm impressed!!!
 
 MzCOM can't run the dll code however, presumably because the version of
 MzCOM I have incorporates version 101 rather than 102.
 
 It gives the following error:
 
 MzScheme error: load-extension: bad version 102 (not 102/13) from "c:\My
 Documents\Scheme\snakes\snakes\whitefang.dll"
 
 * * *
 
 BTW, what does Mz mean?  I'm sure that question must be answered somewhere
 in the help desk, but I don't recall coming across it yet.

 Correction:  MzCOM uses MzScheme version 102; my dll compiled in 102 (minor
 version number 13?) won't run in it.

 It would have been "Ms" (to complement the Mr in MrEd), but we didn't
 want to be confused with Microsoft products. So we spelled it "Mz".

 Actually, it looks like your copy of MzCOM embeds MzScheme 102/13, and
 the whitefang DLL is compiled for version 102.
