>Description:
I am compiling a module which creates structures and procedures 
and stores them at expansion time (somewhat like unit signatures). 
mzc finishes the "optimizing virtual machine code" stage, but is 
unable to emit the C source.

mzc gives the following error message:
 [emitting ANSI C to "./c.c"]
 "/home/ryan/c.scm" [11,12]: INTERNAL ERROR: vm:build-constant: not supported #<struct:zread>

>How-To-Repeat:
The following module definition, when compiled with mzc, will
produce the error above (originally noticed on a larger collection
of modules).

(module c mzscheme
  (define-syntax ts
    (let-struct s (a b c)
      (list (make-s 1 2 3)
            (make-s 4 5 6))))
  (define-syntax open
    (lambda (stx)
      (syntax-case stx ()
        [(_ id)
         (with-syntax [(v (syntax-local-value (syntax id)))]
           (syntax (quote v)))])))
  (define ts1
    (car (open ts)))
  
  (provide ts 
           open
           ts1))

When executed in DrScheme, the module works fine.
ts1 => #(struct:s 1 2 3)

Responsible-Changed-By: mflatt
Responsible-Changed-When: Wed Jan 30 10:50:54 2002
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    compiler -- needs a better error message
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Fri, 25 Nov 2005 07:44:10 -0500
Reason>>> mzc now gives a reasonable error message (the same as for compiling
to .zo):

 write: cannot marshal constant that is embedded in compiled code:
 #<struct:s>
