>Description:
Mzc gives an internal error if a macro tries to expand to a procedure. (Obviously such macros should be disallowed, but they shouldn't crash the compiler).
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile this:

(require (lib "defmacro.ss"))
(define-macro (evil) (lambda () 'foo))
(evil)
>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
State changed from "open" to "closed" by mflatt at Mon, 12 Dec 2005 09:12:35 -0500
Reason>>> This has been fixed for version 300 (to be released soon).

In general, the error message is now the same as for bytecode compilation:

 write: cannot marshal constant that is embedded in compiled code:
 #<procedure:...>

Thanks,
Matthew
