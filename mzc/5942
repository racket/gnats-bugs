Subject: Re: all/5942: mzc Manual in HTML has bug in TITLE tag
Date: Tue, 5 Nov 2002 11:38:59 -0500

 Dorai,
 
 	This looks like a tex2page problem.  The manuals contains the
 line:
 
   \title{PLT {\mzcTemp}: MzScheme Compiler Manual}
 
 where mzcTemp is defined as:
 
   \newcommand{\mzcTemp}[0]{{\sffamily\bfseries mzc}}
   \htmlonly
   \newcommand{\mzcTemp}[0]{{\tt{\bf mzc}}}
   \endhtmlonly
 
 We want the \tt\bf to show up in the manual's title in HTML, but we
 don't want that formatting used in the TITLE element.
 
 Is there a way to have the TITLE element formatted differently, or does
 tex2page itself need to be changed?
 
 -- Paul

 Add
 
 \externaltitle{PLT MzC: MzScheme Compiler Manual}
 
 to the document's .t2p file.  
 
 The original \title command, with the \mzcTemp,
 stays where it is.
 
 Usage: \externaltitle is an optional TeX2page command.
 If present, its argument will be used for the <TITLE>
 element, in preference to \title.  \title's argument
 will continue to be used for the typeset version of the
 title.
 
 \externaltitle can be placed before or after \title.  
 However, a good place to put it is in the .t2p file, as
 it is a no-op as far as (La)TeX is concerned.  As you
 have already found out, if \externaltitle is not
 supplied, \title will be reused as \externaltitle.

 Could that be placed directly in the LaTeX source?

 Yes, provided the LaTeX source has access to a
 definition for \externaltitle that makes it a no-op.
 
 Does the LaTeX source load tex2page.tex (or
 tex2page.sty)?  If so, you are all set and you
 can call \externaltitle wherever you want. 
 
                            *
 
 I notice that the source fragment you used had
 the {htmlonly} environment.  This was defined either
 via tex2page.tex or some other file.  Then,
 
 \begin{htmlonly}
 \externaltitle{...}
 \end{htmlonly} 
 
 is also possible.  (The {htmlonly} isn't necessary 
 if tex2page.tex was used.)
 
                            *
 
 If you are sure you are not loading the tex2page.tex
 macros, you can put \externaltitle inside an
 \if-statement whose test will be true for tex2page but
 false for (La)TeX.  Examples are
 
 \if\shipout\undefined
 \externaltitle{...}
 \fi
 
 \ifnum\language=256
 \externaltitle{...}
 \fi
