>Description:
When MzScheme is compiled using the current (3.2.2 series) version of GCC under Linux, SrPersist is not compatible giving the error:
"srpmain.so: undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0"

Solution:  Build the main MzScheme executable (i.e., the top-level runtime -- not libmzscheme.a or libmzgc.a) using g++ rather than gcc.

 Can that be fixed by linking in a specific library to MzScheme?

 Can mzc add that flag automagically when compiling extensions?

 This looks like a problem with the MyODBC build/configuration, rather
 than a bug in SrPersist.
 
 Guesses: It might be a dynamic library load path issue, or a problem
 with the MyODBC resource file (which is ~/.odbcrc or similiar, to my
 recollection).  Is there a library in the location mentioned in the
 error message?

 I've spent some time looking, but I can't see where this would work.  It
 seems like the g++ compiler inserts the method into the executables it
 produces, and now requires this when dealing with C++ code.

    Fixed.  See new README and Makefile for gcc 3.2
