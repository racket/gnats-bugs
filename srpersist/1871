>Description:
    When using SrPersist (Release 103) with DrScheme (Release 103) on WinNT 4.0 (SP6 & ODBC 3.520.4403.2) attempting to use (alloc-handle 'sql-handle-env) it fails with an error of "Unspecified error in alloc-handle".  alloc-env works fine otherwise.  All other uses of alloc-handle work fine, (alloc-handle 'sql-handle-dbc [handle]) and (alloc-handle 'sql-handle-stmt [handle]).  It appears that only when the [handle] is omitted, which is mandatory for 'sql-handle-env that the error occurs.

>How-To-Repeat:
(define odbc-version 3.52)
(require-library "srpersist.ss" "srpersist")
(define henv (alloc-handle 'sql-handle-env))

 Have you tried using sql-error or diag-rec to get an error
 message?
 
 I tried the same code on NT4 + SP6 with MS ODBC 3.510.3711
 and did not get an error.

 That's puzzling, because alloc-env is deprecated in favor of alloc-handle.
 It could be a bug in the ODBC driver.
 
 If you have time, you might try writing a C/C++ program to do the 
 same thing, i.e., call SQLAllocHandle().  Because your code 
 works here, I don't believe it's a bug in SrPersist, though 
 of course it's possible.

 So now you can use sql-error or diag-rec to get an error message.
 What does it say?

 I get the same error here.  But when I call
 
   > (sql-error henv 'sql-null-hdbc 'sql-null-hstmt)
 
 it tells me
 
   ("HY010" 0 "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Function sequence error")
 
 So I looked up the "HY010" error code for SQLAllocHandle() in the ODBC manual, 
 and see:
 
   HY010	Function sequence error	(DM) The HandleType argument was 
                                      SQL_HANDLE_DBC, and SQLSetEnvAttr 
                                      has not been called to set the SQL_ODBC_VERSION 
                                      environment attribute.
 
 OK, I call 
 
   (set-env-attr henv 'sql-attr-odbc-version 'sql-ov-odbc3)
 
 And now I can call 
 
   (define hdbc (alloc-handle 'sql-handle-dbc henv))
 
 without an error.
 
 In short, add the call to set-env-attr as above before creating 
 the connections handle, and you should be OK.
