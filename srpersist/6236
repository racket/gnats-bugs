>Description:
SrPersist procedure col-attribute fails with attribute 'sql-desc-unsigned on Windows 2000, with both MySQL 4.0/MyODBC3.51 and MS SQLServer 7.0, with msg "uncaught exception: #2(struct:schemeql-unknown-error (("HY090" 0 "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Invalid string or buffer length")))"


>How-To-Repeat:
Discovered while trying to get SchemeQL to work on Win2000 with MySQL and SQL Server. Error occurs whenever I try to execute a statement. I traced it to the imported sr:col-attribute proc.
I have a work-around by setting version test to use proc col-attributes instead.

 I'm going to send you a new srpmain.dll under separate cover.
 Please let me know if this fixes the problem.
