 I'll look into this on Monday.

 What compile errors did you get?

 Dmitry,

 That constant represents the ODBC type SQL_C_SBIGINT (signed 64-bit
 integer).  
 
 In the SrPersist source file plt/src/srpersist.cxx, you'll note that all
 uses of that type require that ODBCVER is 0x300 or greater *and* that
 Win32 is defined.
 
 The reason for that is that this type is represented by the __int64
 type, which is particular to Windows.  You might try to modify the code
 to use a different representation (say, a struct) for 64-bit numbers.
 If you're using gcc to compile, you could use the `long long int' type.
 
 I didn't notice this problem when (long ago) I tried MyODBC/MySQL with
 SrPersist.  Are these ordinary numeric fields?
 
 Let me know what you learn.

 Dmitry,
 
 	I've folded your patch into the exp-tagged code.
 
 	I changed some small things.  In particular, I think your
 _atoi64() would fail in the rare case you gave it the largest possible
 negative 64-bit number.
 
 	Please let me know how this code works under Linux.
