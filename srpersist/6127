>Description:
When loading srpersist outside of DrScheme, I get this error:

load-extension: couldn't open "/usr/lib/plt/collects/srpersist/private/compiled/native/i386-linux/srpmain.so"                          
   (/usr/lib/plt/collects/srpersist/private/compiled/native/i386-linux/srpmain.so: undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0)

I've tried installing srpersist a variety of ways: I used debian's 203-5 mzscheme package and installed the srpersist.plt over it, compiled it with unixodbc, with iodbc, tried compiling the entire source tree from the debian soure dist, always with the same results.

BUT, if I require it from within DrScheme, it seems to work! Hm.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using debian packages:
mzscheme 203-5
drscheme 203-5
unixodbc 2.1.1-10
srpersist 203

Install srpersist in the usual fashion. Write a script which requires srpersist. Tada.

 That's not a symbol that SrPersist imports.  Maybe it's 
 used by unixODBC.
 
 A quick Google search reveals:
 
   __gxx_personality is defined in /usr/lib/libstdc++.a
 
 Well, that's on Mac OS X.  Does adding that library (wherever it 
 might be on your system) to the build of srpmain.so help?

 Hmmm, maybe the error just isn't visible.
