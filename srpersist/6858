Hello!

If it possible to load Srpersist library into mzscheme
My OS if FreeBSD5.1, I was compiling PLT from sources and install srpersist library from its plt archieve by setup-plt. After that i get collects/srpersist directory without srpmain.ss and others native co
I try to do (require (lib "srpersist.ss" "srpersist")) or

bash$mzscheme -M srpersist

and get errror 

open-input-file: cannot open input file: "/usr/local/plt/collects/srpersist/private/srpmain.ss" (No such file or directory; errno=2)

Where is full code of srpersist????? (also note that it is not in the ~/.plt-scheme/206... there was not created such catalog al all)

Responsible changed from "nobody" to "eli" by eli at Sat, 05 Jun 2004 16:26:53 -0400
Reason>>> Closing

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Sat, 05 Jun 2004 16:26:53 -0400
Reason>>> This was a result of bad packaging of the srpersist 
source .plt file.  Should be fixed in 207.
