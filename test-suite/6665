linux-other
>Description:
Presently, it seems impossible to navigate the cursor into or out of the various insertable "boxes" without using the mouse. It might be nice (for more keyboard-oriented users) to be able to enter and exit them with the same keyboard shortcuts (i.e. arrows, page up/page down) that can be used to navigate any other text.

 You're probably looking for control alt down and control alt up.
 control alt left and right are somewhat useful (they move forward and
 backwards to the nearest embedded editor in respective direction).
 
 I'll leave this PR open, since the keystrokes don't work for the test
 case boxes (the just go down "one level" but there are many "hidden"
 levels in the test case boxes), but I'm not sure if that's a problem
 with the test case boxes or not (Mike, if you want to look at the
 implementation of the current key strokes, search for embedded in
 plt/collects/framework/private/keymap.ss).
 
 Still, hopefully you'll find these useful for the host of simpler boxes
 in DrScheme.
