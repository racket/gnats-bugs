>Description:
Like the subject line says.
Check syntax does renaming, but most
  people are more used to find/replace.

>How-To-Repeat:
New window.
(define (f x) x).
Add test case testing (f 3).
Find-replace f with g.
Definition changes, test box doesn't.

Reason>>> mostly test suite, but probably involving Robby and/or 
Matthew (CCed).



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 15:00:42 -0500
Reason>>> Test Case Boxes have been removed.  Use `check-expect' 
instead.
