;; [4] The handling of CHECK-EXPECT by BSL's module transformer breaks for some reason.

   (sandbox-eval/get-output 'beginner '(check-expect (+ 1 2) 0))

;; I would expected this to return the empty string, or some handle to receive the results of the tests,
;; but instead it crashes with "check-expect: found a test that is not at the top level."
