>Description:
check-expect forms are currently accepted and ignored by the interaction window. The test isn't run, and no output or message is produced.

I think that a check-expect form in the interactions window should either 1) be prohibited, and raise an error; or 2) run its test immediately.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sample interaction:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.1 [3m].
Language: Beginning Student custom; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
Teachpack: world.ss.
This program should be tested.
