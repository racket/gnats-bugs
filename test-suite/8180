>Description:
I tried my hand at Joshua's problem "writing a function to make a new list, giving the index of the first occurrence of each natural number in another list."  I wrote my test cases using the DrScheme "insert test case" menu command, hit "check syntax" (all OK), then hit "run".  Some of the test cases had green check marks, the next few had nothing at all, and the last one or two had red X's.  I hit "run" again; this time fewer had green check marks and more had nothing at all.  I hit "run" again, and got yet a different subset of test cases that showed results.  Sometimes there are a few with no result and then one with a green checkmark.  The problem seems less likely to occur if I scroll to the beginning of the definitions window before hitting "run".

 I've committing a change that disables them.
 
 Is this worth polling the plt-edu list? If someone wants them, we can
 setup a planet package with them.
 
 Those who wanted them would have to run something like "planet -i
 ...some stuff..." to get them installed. So, it would be extra work for
 them, but people wouldn't stumble across them by mistake.

 Aren't we talking about the Scheme test case boxes?
 
 I didn't intend to disable the Java ones, but now that you mention I
 think I must have ... sorry! I didn't mean to disable them -- assuming
 you want to maintain them. :)

 I think it's worth polling the HtDC list and probably the plt-edu  
 list as well. I know that some of the teachers there really like the  
 boxes.
 
 -Kathy
 
 p.s. If we release a version with test case boxes disabled, Java  
 example boxes should probably be disabled too, as there's little  
 reason for the example boxes without the test boxes.

 The test case boxes are the same boxes for Java and Scheme... they're  
 about the only box that works (such as they do) for both :)
 
 While I do test that the test case boxes work in the Java modes, I  
 don't actually maintain them generally (Matthew had been doing some  
 of this after Mike left), and don't really want to take on that task.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:47:14 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
