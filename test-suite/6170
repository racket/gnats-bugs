 I have added a print option, but I'm leaving this PR open. The right 
 way to fix this is for the test suite window to use the frame:editor 
 mixin, rather than just frame:standard-menus. This will require some 
 changes tho. So, Mike, please put this on your list.
 
 Also, for some reason, the pasteboards aren't laying out right when 
 being printed. I suspect that the aligned pasteboard might not be 
 calculating the width of the page properly somehow. For now tho, at 
 least something comes out.
 
 Thanks,
 Robby
