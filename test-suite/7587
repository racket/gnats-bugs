>Description:
The big-bang (from the world.ss teachpack) and skippy's test cases interfere with each other.  It appears that calling big-bang causes all test cases to reset themselves, with the effect that the icon only shows up for those test cases that appear *after* the call to big-bang.  In all others, it flickers on for an instant and then disappears.
>How-To-Repeat:
Beginning Student, world.ss teachpack.  Enter the following into the definitions window:

(define (f x) (+ x 1))

;; TEST CASE HERE

(define (tock w)
  (update (empty-scene 10 10) produce (add1 w)))
(big-bang 30 30 1 0)
(on-tick-event tock)

;; TEST CASE HERE

Insert two test cases for f, one at each indicated location.  Hit [Run]; only the second test case will display the icon.

 I saw this behavior without world.ss, and I think that any REPL output
 resets the test-box icons.  Try this program:
 
   (define (f x) (+ x 1))
 
   ;; TEST CASE HERE
 
   0
 
 Then comment out the 0 and try again.

State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:43:20 -0500
Reason>>> closed as "obsolete" with respect to v5.0.99.6 and later; 
either the bug
is long-since fixed, the relevant code doesn't exist 
anymore, the
relevant platform hasn't been supported recently, or a new 
bug report is
needed if the problem really isn't fixed and someone 
actually cares
