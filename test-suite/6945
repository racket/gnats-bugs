>Description:
During the TeachScheme! workshop at Brown July 17 - 18, 2004 I have twice
witnessed a case where upon pressing execute the first time the first test case box did not 
do anything.  It did not evaluate the expression and did not come up with a red x or a green check. 
Upon pressing exceute a second time everything worked fine.  I just heard that it may also happen that random test cases are not
evaluated upon the first execution, but will be on the second press of execute.

Reason>>> Test Case Boxes have been removed.  Use `check-expect' 
instead.
