>Description:
Several features I'd love to see in the test-suite tool:

1) Ability to test an expression that returns multiple values, without having to
   surround it in a
     (call-with-values (lambda () ...) list)

2) If a particular test case fails with an error message, rather that stopping the test
   suite immediately, record the error and continue on with further test cases.  (This
   is by far the most important item here to me personally, especially in light of #3.)

3) It is painfully slow to run a test suite on my SunBlade 100 here at CCS.  Things
   are much faster when I run it on my system at home.  I don't know if this is a
   Linux-vs-Solaris issue, or whether the graphics hardware on these SunBlades is just
   ancient.

 Fixed.
 
 For 2) and 3), I think that the problem with the efficiency is that the
 boxes jump around too much, which is distracting anyway and should be
 fixed. That's a bit more work, so that'll have to be done later[1].
 
 Right now, we treat an error in the test suite as a more fundamental
 failure; a failed test lets you keep going, but an actual runtime error
 seems somehow more of a problem. Its a bit of a funny distinction but,
 the efficiency question aside, I think it works well in practice.
 
 Robby
 
 [1] The basic idea: when a test case runs, still erase the contents of
 the each of the editor-snip result boxes, but keep them the same size,
 rather than letting them shrink back down. Then, once the new results
 are inserted, resize the boxes to the new results if necessary. Also,
 avoid the scrolling around that happens when a test suite runs.

 Well, I suppose that's a matter of personal preference as much as
 anything.  I just find it annoying to have my entire test suite come to
 a screeching halt because test case 3 out of 30 has a typo.  I'd prefer
 it to keep going, so I can see if there are any errors in the remaining
 27 test cases.

 I've resisted this because I wanted the test suite to be able to test 
 things like the various parameters that are set by the 
 current-exception-handler but perhaps that is a foolish desire, or we 
 should have a more specialized testing line for those kind of tests.

 Are you saying that if a test raises an unanticipated exception, you 
 don't catch it and stop the testing process?
 
 I don't think I ever specified that. If I did, I was wrong. You should 
 catch the exception, place it as the "actual value" in the appropriate 
 area and turn on the failed sign.

 I agree with Matthias.  My original request, though, was slightly
 different: catch the exception, use it as the actual value, mark the
 test case as failed, and then continue on with the remaining test cases.
 
 There is, I believe, a difference of opinion as to whether this is the
 Right Thing to do for the teaching languages.  I don't hold any strong
 feelings on that one way or the other, but I do believe that the
 behavior I describe above is the Right Thing for the development
 languages.  If people feel strongly that stop-on-first-error is the
 correct behavior for the teaching languages, could we possibly make this
 a user-configurable option?  (Clearly not for 207; I'm thinking about
 subsequent releases here.)

 That's true, but I was thinking of the fact that students can
 (accidentally) introduce with-handlers into their code and continue in
 strange ways.

 I believe that the boxes are allowed anywhere there is a definition and
 that's a check that happens during expansion. I believe that it's
 possible to distinguish between internal definition position and
 toplevel definition positions, but I don't recall exactly.
