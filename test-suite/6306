>Description:
The test suite chokes when the program that it is supposed to
test performs a read. TS "thinks" that the current directory
is /.
>How-To-Repeat:
open drscheme 
enter 
 (define x (with-input-from-file "bug.dat" read))
 (define (f z) (if (cons? z) (car z) 0))
file|save (choose Home/bug.ss)
edit Home/bug.dat so that it contains something 
'execute' in drscheme to confirm 
file|new test suite
 new
  expression (f 10)
  expected 0
file|save (NOTE: the save button doesn't show up, but I assume that
 this bug has been reported elsewhere)
execute test suite
 see bug appear
