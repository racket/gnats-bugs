>Description:
Test Suite tool closes even if you didn't save your
file and wanted to.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create new test suite.
Whether or not you add any test cases doesn't affect
  the behavior below, though that behavior is especially
  egregious if you *have* added test cases.
Close the window using File | Close or the X at top-right
  in Windows.
The Test Suite Tool asks whether you want Save, Cancel
  or Close Anyway.
Choose Save.  This brings up a file menu.
Now hit escape.
The file menu goes away, but so does the test suite
  window, potentially taking your test suites with it!

Perhaps a failure to check on a return value?
