>Description:
When working in an HTDP language and tests fail, the test results dialog pops up. After correcting the errors and re-running the contents of the definition window, the tests pass, but the dialog is still present. It should be closed each time the definitions are run; it could be confusing because the message is out of date.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Use the Beginning Student language.
2. Enter (check-expect 1 2)
3. Run it. The dialog pops up.
4. Change it to (check-expect 1 1)
5. Run it. The tests pass, but the dialog is still present.
