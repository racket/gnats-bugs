>Description:
The test suite sometimes loses the result of a test: it
appears on screen momentarily, then disappears.
It also messes up the Save button.  It causes it to
somewhat needlessly appear; also, I got the system into
a state where (a) the Save button was not present, (b)
trying to close the window gave me a warning about the
buffer having been modified, (c) typing new keystrokes
in the buffer did not make Save appear.
>How-To-Repeat:
Fresh DrScheme.
Add definition (define (f x) (+ x x)) in def window.
Insert new test case w/ parameters
- testing f as label
- (f 10) as test
- 20 as expected
Save the buffer.
Now click Execute.
1. The Save is back on (because the Test Suite tool has
added the check mark to the test case).  This is annoying
but not as bad as...
2. The actual order of operations is:
- execution begins (REPL clears, banner appears)
- check mark appears in box
- check mark disappears
- next instant, Save button appears

So at the end of this sequence, not only is Save present,
but the check mark is gone!

Suppose you've gone through the above sequence.
Click Execute again.
This time, the check mark persists (the Save button is
still there).
Now click Save.
1. The check mark disappears.
2. Save is still there!
If you click Save one more time, it goes away, but the
next time you click Execute, the entire karmic cycle
begins over and you get reborn as a warthog.

State changed from "open" to "analyzed" by dskippy at Wed, 12 May 2004 11:14:30 -0400
Reason>>> Will fix.

Reason>>> The new embedded-gui toolkit that the new test-suite tool is
implemented in fixes this problem. Thanks a lot for the PR.
