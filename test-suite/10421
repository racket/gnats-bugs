Copy-pasting images creates an image that is not equal? according to the check-expect, when they are in a structure, and when there is no other code (!).

Oddly, only the code below tickles the bug. Any deviations I tried worked.

(define-struct plane (image location direction))

 Hi,
 
 Thanks for the report.
 I'm not seeing a problem with 4.2.1.7, would it be possible for you to  
 check the bug with this more recent version?
 
 Thanks,
 -Kathy

 I tried the example below with plt/collects/icons/anchor.ss and it
 seemed to pass the test case. So, probably there is something more
 that you're doing that I'm not that is required to trigger the bug.

 I can't tickle it on my home machine either. :-/
 
 I'll go back to the lab where I observed the bug and try it again.

 ... and I can't make it work in the lab anymore either. Very odd.
 
 Oh well. I guess there's nothing left to do but to close the bug.
