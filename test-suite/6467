>Description:
I really like the test suite feature but:
[1] would be nice to have it display just the file name rather than the path with the file name so the students name shows
[2] would be nice to have it skip a test if it fails and continue with the next test rather than halt after one test fails.
[3] would be nice to have it display only a test name? and the results when actually grading I don't need to see the test over and over but would be nice to have a compact listing of the results (so you could have several more than three or four tests on the screen at once.
[4] would be nice to be able to assign points for each test and have it total the points for successful test and then present the total points
[5] or how about some XML to email a message back to the student when check or update the gradebook...

Thanks :-)

 Thanks for your comments. You may want to check out Matthew Flatt's
 handin tool, which addresses some of your questions (4,5). For the
 others, all of them will be fixed with our next release of the test
 suite except this one:

 The plan is to continue with the test suites if a test fails, but not
 if there is a runtime error in the test. Partially, DrScheme is
 designed to work better with only a single error, but mostly I'm sure
 that most programs implicitly assume that nothing happens after an
 error occurs. This is especially clear with stateful programs where
 some invariant can be broken once a runtime error occurs.

Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "dskippy" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 02:40:37 -0500
Reason>>> test suite requests

State changed from "open" to "closed" by dskippy at Wed, 12 May 2004 11:11:48 -0400
Reason>>> Old change request from orginal test-suite. Still
considering assigning point values to test cases.
