>Description:
Now that all check-expect expressions (and friends) are evaluated AFTER the rest of the Definitions pane, we're finding a peculiar effect: if you run an animation in your Definitions pane, the window shows up immediately, but nothing actually happens in the window until after the check-expects are finished, which may be many seconds later.  It's easy to think that your animation doesn't work, when in fact it just hasn't started yet.

Suggestion: run the check-expects in a separate thread, at low priority (so the animation runs at an almost normal pace).

 The problem certainly exists. I am not sure I like your suggestion.
