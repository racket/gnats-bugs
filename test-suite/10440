 I'm using this version:
 
 Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.2.1.8-svn8sep2009 [3m].
 Language: Beginning Student; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
 uncaught exception: false

 and I see the right output in the window, but the "uncaught exception:
 false" is a bit strange.

 Strangely enough:
   -- I can't repeat this small example
   -- and the large example from which I derived this thing, I can't  
 reproduce
 
 I saw cached-snip all over the place.
 
 My drscheme is as old as yours.

 There must have been some bad state somehow. We'll just have to keep
 our eyes open.
