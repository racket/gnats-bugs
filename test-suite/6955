>Description:
If you keep your test box closed, but have an error in
one of its expressions, then Execute, you get an error
report in the REPL but can't figure out where it is!

Perhaps in such cases a closed test box should reopen.
>How-To-Repeat:
Fresh DrScheme.
New test box.
To test: (+ 1 2)
Expected: (f 3)  [f is unbound]
Close test box.
Execute.
Error report about unbound f, but no coloring on screen.

>Fix:
>Audit-Trail:
Responsible changed from "nobody" to "dskippy" by eli at Tue, 20 Jul 2004 12:23:03 -0400
Reason>>> test suite


State changed from "open" to "closed" by dskippy at Thu, 12 Aug 2004 16:27:32 -0400
Reason>>> Fixed in CVS. Test boxes will now expand when they contain
errors.
