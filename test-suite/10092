>Description:
Run this "test" in a teaching language: 

(require (lib "universe.ss" "2htdp"))
(check-expect (list iworld1 iworld2) (list iworld2 iworld1))

It's obviously bad. So we get a window. 

The expected and actual value used to be "pretty printed" 
so that the whole thing would fit on a decent size screen

Now it's easily 30 or 40 in wide.

Can we please bring the pretty-printing back? Thanks.

 This bug stems from some change in how language defaults are handled.
 
 When I manually switch my language setting to the default settings  
 (even though I hadn't customized the language settings), newlines  
 again appear in the displayed test reports (which rely on the  
 language's render-value/format method).
 
 I suspect that Robby should be responsible for this bug, but I'm not  
 100% positive on that.
