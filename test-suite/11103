>Description:
Add a check-expect spec to the def window that is sure to fail, 
  say (check-expect 1 2)
RUN. 
The check-expect window pops up and tells you that 1 != 2. 
This comes with a hyperlink to the check that failed. 
If you click on it, it highlights the failed check in red, 
 BUT nothing visible changes. If the check-expect window 
 hides the test case, a user will think that this is just
 a broken link. 
In short, this mechanism violaes basic GUI design. 

I believe that clicking used to do the 'right thing' 
1. If it did, please restore the functionality. 
2. If it didn't, please consider this bug report an 
  extremely high-priority feature request.

 To clarify: it doesn't look like you were running one of the teaching =

 I was running in BSL+ and I just confirmed the problem in BSL+.=20
 
 Perhaps this is a meta-bug for Robby.=20

 Hi Robby,
 
 I could use a little help addressing this bug; I'm trying to give the =
 DrRacket window/frame the focus using=20
 
 (send (send (send (send current-rep get-definitions-text) get-tab) =
 get-frame) focus))
 
 Where I know that the current-rep is "correct" because I am correctly =
 highlighting the definitions window I want to be using the same value =
 (and is a rep).
 
 This call has no visible effect; and after going through the =
 documentation for awhile I can't see how I should switch the focus from =
 the test window to the DrRacket window (let alone to the correct tab...)
 
 Advice highly appreciated.
 Cheers,
 -Kathy
