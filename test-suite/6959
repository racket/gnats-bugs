>Description:
Test case boxes cause the editor window to scroll on Execute,
  annoying users by forcing them to scroll back to what they
  were looking at.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file long enough to need a vertical scroll bar.  
At the bottom, insert a test case box.
Scroll back to the top (so the test case is off the bottom).
Click Execute.
DrScheme scrolls down to the test case box, ignoring what the
  user wanted to have on screen.  (This is even if the test
  succeeds, so there is no real need to call the user's attention
  to this test.)
Curiously, this doesn't happen if the test box is closed.  But
  this is related to my earlier bug report that saving and loading
  behaves like Pandora.

Reason>>> test suite



State changed from "open" to "closed" by eli at Tue, 06 Dec 2011 15:00:47 -0500
Reason>>> Test Case Boxes have been removed.  Use `check-expect' 
instead.
