>Description:
Each time (test) is run, it seems to add in another set of redundant tests.
>How-To-Repeat:
When I run this program:

#lang scheme
(require test-engine/scheme-tests)
(check-expect 1 2)
(test)
(test)
(test)

I get this output:

Welcome to DrScheme, version 4.2.4.1-svn23jan2010 [3m].
Language: Module; memory limit: 128 megabytes.
Ran 1 check.
0 checks passed.
	Actual value 1 differs from 2, the expected value.
 At line 3 column 0
Ran 2 checks.
0 checks passed.
	Actual value 1 differs from 2, the expected value.
 At line 3 column 0
	Actual value 1 differs from 2, the expected value.

Ran 3 checks.

But I just expected the "Run 1 check." line and the two that follow to be repeated 3 times, instead of running 6 tests.
