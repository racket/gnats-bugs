>Description:
If I show the equality test in a test suite, and don't modify anything, I get the following error:
"equal? : this primitive operator must be applied to arguments; expected an open parenthesis before the primitive operator name in equal?"

I cannot figure out what the proper syntax for defining an equality test is.  
I am unable to locate the directions for such in the documentation.

I need a custom equality test when the function returns an indefinite number, e.g. the area of a circle, where the equality test is really a tolerance test.


>How-To-Repeat:
Test any function, e.g. (define (f x) x)

 The test suite tool is in "alpha" though you're welcome to use it of  
 course.
 
 Try this:
   1. create a file with f(x) = x
   2. create a new test suite
   3. define new helper (define (my-equal? x y) false)
       and create a test case like (f 10) = 10, run and see test case  
 succeed
   4. select Test | Show "equality test" and select Language |  
 Intermediate
       (this does not affect the language setting for the definitions  
 window)
   5. now replace "equal?" in that box with my-equal?
 
 Re-run test case and watch the test fail -- due to the false in  
 my-equal?
 
 In the next major release, the test suite window will be integrated into
 DrScheme proper and these things will be easier.
 
 Thanks -- Matthias

Responsible-Changed-From-To: eli->nobody
Responsible-Changed-By: gnats@champlain.ccs.neu.edu
Responsible-Changed-When: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 04:56:21 -0500
Responsible-Changed-Why:


Responsible changed from "nobody" to "dskippy" by eli at Fri, 02 Apr 2004 01:52:23 -0500
Reason>>> test suite.  (Maybe should be immediately closed?  This is 
an old report.)

State changed from "open" to "closed" by dskippy at Thu, 04 Nov 2004 16:55:41 -0500
Reason>>> The new version of the test-suite tool solves this by having
an error if you fail to fill one of the boxes
