>Description:
Run a program with a check-expect that fails. 
Dock the report UI. 
Fix mistakes. 
Re-run. 
 -- the interactions window will say "all tests passed!"
 -- the docked report UI will continue to claim that a test 
    failed. 

I believe someone mentioned this in detail in some posting 
to plt-edu or -scheme. 
>How-To-Repeat:
See above. Use 

(define (f x) 1)
(check-expect (f 0) 0) 
;; run, change the 1 to a 0 
;; re-run
