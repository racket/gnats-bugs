>Description:
Inconsistent behavior between File | Close and killing window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create New Test Suite.
Create a New test case, so the "Save" button appears.
Close the window using File | Close; in the resulting popup,
Save is selected and has focus, and tabbing works.
Close the window using the check box at the top right instead
(under Windows).  In the resulting popup, Save is not
selected (so pressing space brings up a Save As box)
but doesn't have focus, so pressing tab has no effect.

Responsible-Changed-When: Sat Dec  7 14:02:43 2002
Responsible-Changed-Why:
    this appears to be a bug about that dialog in general
    (for any time when you close the window) and is
    probably something I should fix with message-box/custom
