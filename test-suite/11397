>Description:
The test result window keeps popping up annoyingly when typing things in the interactions window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following in a BSL file:

When you run the file, the test result window pops up alerting to the failed test. Close the window, then type some expression in the Interactions:

> 42

The test results window pops up again and comes to the front.

 This behavior does not seem to be happening any longer with Racket 6.x. I
 think this case can probably be closed.
